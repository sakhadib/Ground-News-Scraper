GN_20250825_212137_80ec5903,"Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted of a royal defamation charge that could have led to a 15-year prison sentence. His lawyer, Winyat Chatmontree, confirmed the court's acquittal verdict, which was disclosed in a news release by the Bangkok Criminal Court. The court found the evidence too weak to support a conviction and noted that the prosecution's interview account lacked context. Thaksin has maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and he has not spent any time in prison since leaving office.","On August 22, 2025, a Bangkok court cleared Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand's former prime minister, of charges related to alleged royal defamation due to a lack of sufficient evidence. The case originated from a 2015 interview Thaksin gave while in exile and was initiated by the royalist military forces responsible for removing him from power in the 2006 coup. Thaksin, aged 76, appeared at court smiling, wore a yellow necktie symbolizing monarchy, denied wrongdoing, and told reporters the case was ""dismissed"". He faced up to 15 years in prison under lese-majeste laws, but upon arrival, he was given an eight-year term on graft and misuse of power charges, which the king later reduced to one year before he was released early in February 2024. The verdict eased legal pressure on Thaksin, who remains politically active though without government role, while a separate court will soon rule on his daughter's political future.","Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted of royal defamation charges by the Criminal Court, as confirmed by his lawyer, but no reason was provided for the dismissal. This ruling marks a significant moment for the Shinawatra family, who have faced declining popularity in Thai politics after two decades of influence. Prosecutions under Thailand's lese-majeste law have sharply increased since 2020, with rights groups stating that over 280 individuals have been prosecuted for violating this law in the last five years. The case stems from Thaksin's 2015 comments during an interview with foreign media while in exile."

Joseph Kabila has been accused of supporting the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels that have seized cities in eastern DRC this year, according to the charge sheet seen by the AFP news agency. The DRC lifted a moratorium on the death penalty last year; however, no judicial executions have occurred since, as noted in the reported court proceedings.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a preliminary injunction to protect sanctuary jurisdictions from stripped federal funds. The Trump administration seeks to pressure these communities to support immigration enforcement, as stated in one of their executive orders. Cities that sued claim that billions of dollars in funding are at risk due to the administration's actions against sanctuary policies.","On Friday evening, U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a ruling preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from a group of cities and counties-including major municipalities such as Boston, Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles-due to their sanctuary policies that restrict collaboration with federal immigration authorities. This decision came after President Trump issued executive orders instructing federal officials to withhold funding from jurisdictions that implement policies protecting undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement. In May, a list identifying over 500 sanctuary jurisdictions as noncompliant was released by Homeland Security, while the Justice Department initiated lawsuits against several cities, including New York and Los Angeles, regarding their sanctuary policies. Judge Orrick called the administration's actions an unconstitutional coercive threat and extended a preliminary injunction blocking funding cuts, noting the administration offered no opposition to the extension. The ruling preserves billions of dollars in federal funds for sanctuary jurisdictions and signals judicial resistance to the administration's efforts to punish cities limiting immigration enforcement cooperation.","A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot deny funding to 34 cities and counties with sanctuary policies limiting federal immigration cooperation, according to U.S. District Judge William Orrick. Judge William Orrick extended a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from withholding federal funds for its 'sanctuary' policies. The administration's executive orders targeting sanctuary jurisdictions were deemed unconstitutional, with Orrick labeling them a 'coercive threat' that threatens billions in funding.
