      "text": "'Can't make this up': Jim Jordan ripped for citing Maxwell interview to defend Trump\nRep. Jim Jordan (R–Ohio) has cited Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell’s interview with the Department of Justice as apparent exculpatory evidence regarding President Donald Trump’s alleged association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nDuring an appearance on \"The Big Weekend Show\" on Fox News on Saturday, Jordan referenced Maxwell’s statement that she “never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way” to argue that there is “nothing there” implicating Trump.\nJordan commented, “This confirms what we all knew,” adding, “We knew President Trump didn’t do anything wrong here … this transcript is the whole transcript and it confirms that.”\nREAD MORE: Vice president sparks uproar among legal experts with a single word\nHe concluded: “So I think there’s nothing there, it seems, based on what we got from the interview of Ms. Maxwell.\"\n”In July, four former Ohio State University wrestlers alleged in lawsuits that Jordan, then an assistant wrestling coach from 1986 to 1994, failed to protect them from the team's doctor, Richard Strauss, who later faced widespread accusations of sexual misconduct.\nAccording to these plaintiffs, it would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware of Strauss’s actions, which they said were “common knowledge” within the wrestling program.\nOne former wrestler, Dunyasha Yetts, recounted reporting an uncomfortable physical exam to Jordan and the head coach at the time; according to Yetts, they subsequently spoke with Strauss about the incident.\nREAD MORE: MAGA is panicking as Trump finally meets his match\nJordan has denied any knowledge of abuse during his tenure, stating that no one ever reported such behavior to him.\nMeanwhile, his Saturday remarks about Maxwell's testimony were mocked on social media.\nPolitical commentator Brian Cohen wrote on the social platfom X: \"If you can trust anyone when it comes to exposing pedophilia, it’s Jim Jordan.\"\nWriter Michael Freeman said: \"You can’t make this up. Congressman who turned a blind eye to sexual abuse endorses claims by perpetrator of sexual abuse.\"\nAuthor John Pavlovitz said: \"There has never been a better friend to pedophiles than @Jim_Jordan.\"\nNiels Groenveld wrote: \"Pathetic take. Ghislaine Maxwell is a convicted sex trafficker, not a beacon of truth. Treating her word as exoneration is like boasting a serial killer vouched for your innocence. How much longer can Jordan keep humiliating himself groveling for Trump?\"\nGreg MacEachern, a communications strategist, wrote: \"Jordan seems very happy to take the word of a convicted sex offender as long as that convicted sex offender is saying exactly what he wants her to say.\""

      "text": "Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell tells Justice Dept. she did not see Trump act in ‘inappropriate way’\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON — Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein’s imprisoned former girlfriend and accomplice, repeatedly denied in her interview with the Justice Department having witnessed any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday meant to distance the president from the sex-trafficking case.\nThe Trump administration issued transcripts from interviews that Deputy Atty. Gen. Todd Blanche conducted with Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over its refusal to disclose a trove of records from the case.\nThe records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior. The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when Trump has faced questions about his former longtime friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days’ worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump’s base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view.\nAfter her interview with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction for luring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.\nHer trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein’s homes.\nShe was convicted of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor.\nVictims of Epstein and Maxwell and victims’ family members, among others, have expressed outrage at her prison relocation and the Trump administration’s handling of the case.\nNeither Maxwell’s lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons has explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.”\nMaxwell is widely believed to be seeking a presidential pardon, which Trump has not ruled out.\n‘Never inappropriate’\n“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. She said she had been to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., sometimes alone, but hadn’t seen Trump since the mid-2000s.\nAsked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nMaxwell was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche — one of Trump’s personal lawyers before joining the Justice Department — at a Florida courthouse. She was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except in the event of a false statement.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victims’ information.\nHigh-profile contacts\nThe case had long captured public attention in part because of Epstein’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Britain’s Prince Andrew, former President Clinton and Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before the financier came under investigation.\nMaxwell told Blanche that Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein’s, and that she never saw him receive a massage — nor did she believe he ever did. The only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they traveled on Epstein’s plane.\n“That would’ve been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,” Maxwell said. “And he didn’t, because I was there.”\nShe also spoke glowingly of Britain’s Prince Andrew and dismissed as “rubbish” the late Virginia Giuffre’s claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell’s London home.\nMaxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein’s conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she claimed she never understood that to “encompass children.” Prosecutors presented evidence at trial showing she and Epstein both knew some victims were underage.\n“I did see from when I met him, he was involved, or — involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterize it — with women who were in their 20s,” she told Blanche. “And then the slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behavior.”\nEpstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators determined was suicide.\nA story that’s consumed the Justice Department\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration following a two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department last month that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist, and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government cover-up during previous administrations. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”\nThe administration made a stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weeks-long review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department determined that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”\nFaced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” his own supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein hoax.”\nThe Justice Department has responded to a subpoena from House lawmakers by pledging to turn over information.\nTucker, Sisak and Richer write for the Associated Press.

She said that Trump “seemed friendly” with Epstein, though she had only seen both of them together in “social settings.” She further praised Trump as a “gentleman in all respects,” whom she had never seen in any massage setting. Maxwell additionally denied having any knowledge of the existence of a “client list.”\nGhislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls from 1994 to 2004 to be sexually abused. She allegedly committed the offense by befriending certain victims through her conversation with them about their lives and families. She is currently serving her 20-year sentence at a minimum security prison camp in Texas. The case had long garnered public attention due to the involvement of high-profile figures such as Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton, and Trump.\nEpstein, who was accused of sexually abusing several teenage girls, was found deceased in a New York federal prison cell in August 2019, and the DOJ later affirmed that his death was a suicide. The release of the interview transcripts follows a backlash against the Trump administration over the non-disclosure of files related to the Epstein case.\nUS District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer earlier this month rejected the Trump administration’s request to unseal grand jury materials from the sex trafficking case, citing a lack of special circumstances and public interest."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell has delighted MAGA loyalists by asserting that she never saw the man she is hoping will spring her from a 20-year prison sentence “in any inappropriate setting” throughout the years he spent hanging out with the late convicted sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\nBut Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking minors and conspiracy, among other charges, whom Trump has already rewarded with a move to a minimum-security prison camp, went further than that, according to transcripts of her interviews with Justice Department officials released Friday.\n“I never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate with a woman of any age,” she said, referring to her years of interactions with men who socialized with Epstein, her former companion. “I never saw inappropriate habits.”\n“That would be a flat no to any man,” she added.\nMaxwell was interviewed over two days by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, whose past work as Trump’s personal attorney appears to create a sizeable conflict of interest. The former socialite continues to deny her own guilt in lining up sexual partners for Epstein, many of them underage, and is appealing her conviction. In her sessions with Blanche, conducted in July, she offered similarly worded exonerations of many of the prominent men whose relationships with Epstein have prompted accusations of wrongdoing. Nor, she said, was there any kind of a client list or instances of Epstein recording the men for whom he arranged sexual encounters.\nMaxwell was bipartisan with her exonerations, claiming former president Bill Clinton, contrary to widespread speculation, was not close to Epstein, and did not visit Epstein’s notorious private island in the Caribbean.\n“Absolutely never went,” she said. “And I can be sure of that because there’s no way he would’ve gone—I don’t believe there’s any way that he would’ve gone to the island, had I not been there. Because I don’t believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.”\n“President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein’s friend,” Maxwell said.\nMaxwell disputed claims by Epstein’s victim Virginia Giuffre—who died by suicide in 2025—that Prince Andrew, the brother of Britain’s King Charles, raped Giuffre during visits to an Epstein property, claiming the two never even met. (Andrew settled a lawsuit filed by Giuffre without admitting liability.)\nWhat about the famous defense attorney and Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who represented Epstein? Giuffre had leveled and then later retracted accusations against him that involved massages and a bathrobe. Did he, Blanche asked, ever do “anything inappropriate?”\n“Absolutely not,” Maxwell said. “I don’t remember anything about him ever getting massaged. I don’t ever have any recall, I don’t believe I ever even saw him in a bathrobe. I have no knowledge of that.”\nNor did Maxwell recall if former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who socialized with Epstein while Summers was the president of Harvard University and Epstein was a donor, traveled on Epstein’s plane.\nBlanche pressed Maxwell on a host of other famous men, including brothers Andrew and Chris Cuomo, the late Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, and former Secretary of State John Kerry. Despite speculation, Maxwell said Epstein knew none of them. Blanche even asked about George Soros, the billionaire financier, who features in a variety of far-right, antisemitic conspiracy theories, including some involving Epstein.\n“I don’t think [Epstein] knew him,” Maxwell said.\nOne exception, however, is Robert Kennedy Jr., now the Health and Human Services Secretary. Maxwell said that Kennedy had joined Epstein on a “dinosaur bone hunting trip in the Dakotas in the 1980s. But, as with all the others: “I never saw anything inappropriate with Mr. Kennedy.”\nMaxwell also said that she does not recall a suggestive birthday note that the Wall Street Journal reported Trump sent Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump denies sending the letter and has sued the paper over its report. Maxwell does remember creating the “birthday book” for Epstein, which was reportedly filled with notes and testimonials from such luminaries as Clinton, Dershowitz, and financier Leon Black. The idea, Maxwell said, came from her mother. But she asserted that she could not remember whether Trump, or anyone specific, contributed.\n“It’s been so long,” Maxwell said when asked to recall the names of contributors to the book. “I want to tell you, but I don’t remember.”\nThe trade here is obvious. Memory lapses that help the pardon-happy president try to move past speculation about his own involvement with late sex criminal offer Maxwell’s best bet for getting out of prison. Indeed, Maxwell, who federal prosecutors said lied “brazenly” under oath during her 2021 trial, has every reason to fib about Trump now. But laying it on so thick, in such a nakedly transactional exchange, may have the opposite of its intended outcome."

According to the transcripts, Maxwell described Trump as “a gentleman in all respects” during their interactions. They first got to know each other in the 1990s through her father, Robert Maxwell, she recalled. They remained cordial well into the ’00s, with Maxwell remembering Trump as being “cordial” and “very kind” to her.\n“And I just want to say that I find — I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now.

He threw his support behind the Justice Department’s decision to send the files to the House Oversight Committee with a feisty response. “Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt. But I’m in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn’t care less,” Trump told reporters, per USA TODAY. He added that he’s instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to provide Congress with as much information as possible on the files.\nTrump then went on to dismiss the Epstein saga as a “Democrat hoax.” He suggested it’s a distraction from what he called “the greatest six months, seven months in the history of the presidency.” Additionally, Trump noted that Epstein “knew everybody in Palm Beach,” implying many names might appear in the files without indicating guilt.\nTrump: “It's a Democrat hoax.

The White House wasted no time addressing those claims, calling it a “fake news story.” Trump himself denied the report. The President insisted he had never been informed about his name being in the mix of the Epstein case. According to the WSJ, however, Bondi allegedly briefed Trump back in May, saying his name was in the documents, but it wasn’t necessarily tied to any wrongdoing.\nIn response to the claims, Trump took to Truth Social, per NPR, writing, “I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his ‘pile of garbage’ newspaper, the WSJ. That will be an interesting experience!!!”\nTrump’s been adamant that his friendship with Epstein ended after finding out the former financier was allegedly stealing his staff, per PBS.

Across two days of questioning, she confronted the themes that now shadow the American administration and some of the world’s most powerful men: was her father, Robert Maxwell, the root of a sprawling intelligence operation—one that extended through his daughter’s relationship with the mysteriously wealthy Epstein and reached leaders from Prince Andrew to Bill Clinton and even Donald Trump?\nThe session was not a cooperation deal or plea bargain but a proffer under limited immunity. Prosecutors could impeach Maxwell if she later contradicted herself.\nMaxwell sat with her lawyers. Across the table were Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, FBI Special Agent Spencer Horn, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Mark Beard. Their questions probed Epstein’s fortune, his circle of elites, the persistent intelligence rumors, and his death.\nOn Friday afternoon, the Justice Department released hundreds of pages of partially redacted transcripts and audio recordings from the interviews. The White House presented this as a gesture of transparency amid backlash from Trump’s base and criticism from Democrats. The redactions, though extensive in places, still allowed readers to follow the central exchanges.\nThe closest Maxwell came to portraying Epstein as involved in anything “covert” or “nefarious” was in a curious recollection: “He showed me a photograph of himself with African warlords… He said he was in the business of finding stolen money for billionaires. He would take a percentage of what he recovered.”\nDid Maxwell—who has already been convicted of perjury—lie again to shield powerful friends?\nOne exchange, centering on perhaps the most notorious and publicly recognized piece of evidence in the Epstein saga, suggests she may have.\nBlanche: “The photograph of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre has been described as one of the most consequential pieces of evidence. How do you respond?”\nMaxwell: “It’s manufactured. Literally a fake photo. My London flat was too small to host such an encounter, and the date on the back doesn’t match flight logs. My friendship with Andrew made him trust Epstein more, but I had nothing to do with that picture.”\nOn Robert Maxwell and Intelligence\nBlanche: “With respect to your father, there have been multiple questions about whether he worked for any intelligence agency. Do you have any knowledge about that?”\nMaxwell: “I think—well certainly my father had a background in intelligence… I believe he did in the second World War. He was… a British intelligence officer. I think that… once you’ve been an intelligence officer, you’re kind of—always; it doesn’t mean that you’re formally employed.”\nShe added she had “no formal knowledge” of specific activities, but believed he “did help people.”\nOn whether Robert Maxwell ever introduced her to Epstein, she was emphatic: “They never met… I know they never met.” She said her father vetted Epstein through Bear Stearns leaders “Jimmy Cayne and… Ace Greenberg.”\nMaxwell’s words were cautious, but telling. She essentially confirmed what intelligence veterans often describe: once active in that world, many never fully leave. By her account, her father lived as a businessman and politician but remained an informal node in intelligence—“trading business or ideas” with powerful people and institutions.\nThis amounts to an acknowledgment: Robert Maxwell lived and died inside the world of intelligence. His role as publisher, financier, and political broker likely made him a valuable cutout, and that was likely a profitable arrangement for his family. Plausible reporting over decades has strongly supported ties to MI6 and Mossad. The most persistent allegations involve the sale of bugged PROMIS software to U.S. government agencies on behalf of Israel’s Mossad, and financial dealings with Soviet bloc actors. None of these claims have been proven in court. But the limited comments of Ghislaine Maxwell suggest she knew her father’s business well.\nOn Epstein, Mossad, CIA, and the FBI\nBlanche: “Have you ever had any contact… from Mossad…?”\nMaxwell: “Well, not deliberately… Not deliberately.”\nBlanche: “Did you ever think that Mr. Epstein was getting any money from any intelligence agency, including Mossad?”\nMaxwell: “Well, I don’t believe so, but I wouldn’t know. I mean, I would be very surprised if he did. I don’t think so. No.”\nHorn: “CIA? DIA?”\nMaxwell: “I don’t think so. I just don’t think he had the wherewithal, and I think that whole aspect is bullshit.”\nHer denials stand in contrast with reasonably credible, though not court-validated, media reporting. In 2019, journalist Vicky Ward reported in The Daily Beast that a former White House official said they had heard Alexander Acosta—then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, who handled Epstein’s 2007 plea deal at the end of the George W. Bush presidency—tell Trump transition interviewers in 2017: “I was told Epstein ‘belonged to intelligence’ and to ‘leave it alone,’” adding that Epstein was “above his pay grade.”\nEpstein’s Suspicious Wealth\nBlanche: “How did Epstein make his money?”\nMaxwell: “He started as a math teacher at Dalton. From there he was hired by Bear Stearns… At Bear Stearns, he developed some new type of trading system—a trading vehicle. Then, after a disagreement, he left. That’s when he said he was in the business of finding stolen money for billionaires. He would take a percentage of what he recovered. But I was not part of his business world, except tangentially.”\nShe identified “very important clients”: Les Wexner—for whom Epstein “structured or restructured The Limited,” handled “his entire personal finances,” and “all of the investment strategy” (she speculated the 71st-Street townhouse, the vast Upper East Side mansion that became Epstein’s New York base, factored into compensation); Leon Black—“the same as what he did for Wexner”; another connected female in their circle provided the—“same help in business,” and even “contracts for the maids”; and there was an unnamed wealthy Ohio woman with “the largest Klein painting.”\nRumors have long swirled that Epstein’s fortune was less about finance and more about leverage — that his friendships with billionaires, politicians, and world leaders provided opportunities for kompromat, even blackmail. Investigators, journalists, and critics have speculated that his homes may have doubled as “honey traps,” recording powerful men in compromising situations to secure influence.\nOn blackmail: “Never. No… I thought he was a legitimate businessman, very conscientious, very good at math.”\nOn Clinton, Trump, Barak, and Movie Stars\nBlanche: “You’ve been named on flight logs with President Clinton. How would you describe his relationship with Mr. Epstein?”\nMaxwell: “President Clinton was my friend. Not Epstein’s… Clinton traveled on Epstein’s plane twenty-six times, or whatever the flight logs say. I was there. He never received a massage. I never saw anything improper.”\nBlanche: “Did you ever see Mr. Clinton participate in massages or any improper behavior with young women?”\nMaxwell: “No. Never. I was there. He never received a massage. I never saw anything improper.”\nOn specifics, she described joint travel:\n- Cuba, where she said Clinton met Fidel Castro.\n- Italy, a Vatican visit with Clinton aide Mark Middleton and Middleton’s wife to see Henry VIII’s divorce documents.\n- Africa, where Clinton flew with Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey aboard Epstein’s jet.\nShe also volunteered: “I was very central in the ramp-up [of] the Clinton Global Initiative” and suggested Epstein “may have helped me help them” financially—without details.\nBlanche: “What about Donald Trump? Your name and his are often linked through Epstein.”\nMaxwell: “My father knew Trump. I admired him… Trump was never inappropriate with anybody. Never.”\nBlanche: “Did you ever see Mr. Trump at Epstein’s homes or on his planes?”\nMaxwell: “No. I never saw anything like that. I never saw him in any improper context with Epstein.”\nHorn: “We’ve seen reports of Epstein’s relationship with Ehud Barak. Given your father’s deep ties to Israel, what was your impression of that connection?”\nMaxwell: “I can think of Ehud Barak, yes. But I don’t know the details of their relationship. My father loved Israel, so I pay attention to it. We have ties to Israel. But I can’t tell you more.”\nOn the “Black Book”\nBlanche: “Was there a client list? A black book of names?”\nMaxwell: “There is no list. We’ll start with that… Nothing like that.”\nOn Epstein’s Prison Death\nMaxwell said she does not believe Epstein killed himself, but also rejected the idea that he was silenced to protect powerful figures.\n“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” Maxwell said.\nWhen asked if she had any theory about who might have killed him, she replied, “I don’t.” Pressed further on whether she thought Epstein was murdered to “keep him quiet” because he had information about “rich and powerful people,” she answered, “I do not have any reason to believe that.”\n“And I also think it’s ludicrous,” she added, noting that if such people had wanted him dead, “they would’ve had plenty of opportunity when he wasn’t in jail.”\nThe Bureau is a reader-supported publication.\nTo receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\nBusiness\nA Nation Built on Sand: How Canada Squanders Its Abundance\nBy Garry Clement\nColumnist Garry Clement, former RCMP anti–money laundering expert, argues Canada’s leaders have built prosperity on sand — leaving the nation exposed to collapse unless urgent reforms are made.\nCanada is celebrated abroad as a safe, prosperous, and open society. But beneath the surface, a far more precarious reality is taking shape. The pillars of our economy — land, real estate, natural resources, and immigration — have been left vulnerable to foreign manipulation, criminal exploitation, and political negligence. The result is what can only be described as a sandcastle economy — striking at first glance, but fragile. Like the parable of the house built on sand, it is a foundation vulnerable to give way when the storm comes.\nInvestigative journalist Sam Cooper has long warned that foreign capital and organized crime have deeply infiltrated Canada’s real estate market. On Prince Edward Island, the Bliss and Wisdom Buddhist group quietly acquired swaths of farmland and property, raising questions about how religious fronts with Chinese connections gained such leverage in a province with limited oversight. In Saskatchewan, Chinese investors have been buying up valuable farmland, raising alarms about food sovereignty and the lack of restrictions on foreign ownership of agricultural land. Meanwhile in British Columbia, governments continue to downplay or outright ignore the extent to which transnational money laundering has fueled a housing market now completely detached from local incomes.\nAll of this has unfolded against a backdrop of minimal transparency, weak beneficial ownership registries, and virtually no effective enforcement. The same blind spots that allowed casinos and luxury real estate in Vancouver to become laundromats for dirty money are now being replicated nationwide.\nThe most urgent threat tied to these financial blind spots is fentanyl. Canada has become one of the world’s top destinations for proceeds from synthetic drug trafficking — a crisis that has devastated families from coast to coast. Chinese triads, Mexican cartels, and local gangs launder profits through casinos, shell companies, and real estate deals. Yet federal legislation continues to lag behind, leaving law enforcement outgunned. Every toxic opioid death in Canada is not only a health tragedy, but also a reminder of how organized crime is exploiting our lax financial controls. While other countries have implemented tough anti-money laundering regimes, Canada remains dangerously complacent.\nThat same complacency extends to national security. Canada has repeatedly delayed designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, despite overwhelming evidence of its involvement in financing terrorism and conducting influence operations abroad. Our allies — including the United States — have acted. Canada, however, remains an outlier, seemingly unwilling to confront the risk of Iranian proxy activity operating in plain sight within our borders.\nImmigration policy reveals similar weaknesses. Foreign students, particularly from India, have become central to the financial survival of colleges and universities. Yet a growing number are not here primarily to study. Instead, education visas have become a backdoor into Canada’s workforce, particularly in industries such as trucking. The tragic Humboldt Broncos bus crash in 2018 exposed gaps in training and licensing in the trucking sector. Since then, reports have continued to surface of foreign students entering the industry without adequate skills — a risk not only to public safety but to the integrity of our immigration system. Ottawa has failed to adequately regulate this pipeline, preferring instead to rely on the tuition dollars and temporary labour it generates.\nEditor’s Note: Forthcoming Bureau investigations, citing U.S. government sources, question how widespread fraud and Indian transnational crime capture of Canada’s commercial trucking industry have fueled the flow of fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamine — turning the country into a weak link for its international allies.\nThe threads running through these crises are clear: willful blindness, weak laws, and short-term political expediency. Land and natural resources are being sold without regard for sovereignty. Real estate markets are distorted by laundered money. Organized crime groups funnel fentanyl profits into Canada with ease. The IRGC operates without effective restriction. And the education system is exploited as a labour channel, with little oversight. Canada is, in effect, trading away its long-term security for short-term economic gains.\nPoliticians, bureaucrats, and regulators too often dismiss warnings as alarmist or xenophobic, when in fact they reflect real risks to the stability of the country. A sandcastle can stand tall on the shore, admired in the moment, but everyone knows what comes next. Unless urgent steps are taken — enforcing transparency in land ownership, restricting foreign control of farmland and resources, tightening anti-money laundering measures, confronting hostile foreign actors, and restoring integrity to the education and immigration systems — collapse is inevitable.\nThe signs are already here: families priced out of homes, farmers squeezed out of land, fentanyl overdoses climbing, and a public losing faith in the fairness of the system. Canada prides itself on being open and inclusive. But openness without vigilance is vulnerability. Like unwise stewards, our leaders have been gifted with a land of overflowing abundance, and yet they have squandered its potential through short-sighted choices. That failure must be corrected — immediately and wisely — if the nation is to not only thrive, but survive.\nThe Bureau is a reader-supported publication.\nTo receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\nFormer senior RCMP officer Garry Clement consults with corporations on anti-money laundering, contributed to the Canadian academic text Dirty Money, and wrote Canada Under Siege, and Undercover, In the Shady World of Organized Crime and the RCMP\nCrime\nCivil Forfeiture Case Reveals B.C. Fentanyl Network Tied to Chinese Precursor Shift\nDrug lab at Seux Road near Mission, BC\nSeizures included significant amounts of 4-Piperidone — a key upstream fentanyl precursor that Chinese suppliers adopted after U.S. restrictions on NPP and ANPP\nA new civil forfeiture case in British Columbia has surfaced extraordinary details about a clandestine fentanyl production network that investigators say operated with academic-level expertise, imported laboratory equipment from overseas, and, significantly, relied predominantly on 4-Piperidone, a precursor chemical that Chinese suppliers moved to after the U.S. government cracked down on previous analogs.\nThe Bureau’s analysis of the filing and information from expert sources suggests the network is consistent with the hybrid model now driving the global fentanyl trade: Chinese Communist Party–linked chemical suppliers, Mexican cartel distributors, and Iranian transnational networks partnering with Canadian gangs, notably the Wolfpack Alliance, to embed industrial-scale production inside British Columbia.\nIn a case first reported by the Vancouver Sun, filed August 13 in B.C. Supreme Court, the Director of Civil Forfeiture seeks to seize three properties in Langley and Aldergrove, three vehicles, and $1,860 in cash linked to the alleged operation.\nThe filing names Cesar Douglas Escobar-Calderon, Harpal Singh Gill, Michaela Marie Butler Christensen also known as Michaela Marie Gill, and One Oak Construction Ltd. as defendants. Investigators allege Gill purchased large volumes of fentanyl precursors under a fictitious company name, and ordered professional laboratory equipment from overseas to outfit clandestine labs. Equipment and chemicals were distributed through a network of suburban properties, including Pitt Meadows, Mission, Aldergrove, and Langley.\nWhile the filing does not name the overseas jurisdiction where Gill allegedly sourced high-grade laboratory equipment and fentanyl precursors, prior U.S. sanctions cases focused on British Columbia indicate China is almost certainly the origin, consistent with wider patterns documented in the global fentanyl trade.\nCourt documents show RCMP arrested Escobar-Calderon at a Pitt Meadows site alongside 359 grams of fentanyl, large volumes of precursors including pyridine, propanoyl chloride, and aniline, and laboratory equipment contaminated by residues.\nBut the most significant seizure came at a property on Seux Road in Mission, a mountainous northern pocket of the Fraser Valley outside Greater Vancouver. The site resembled a smaller version of the so-called superlab dismantled in Falkland, B.C., and appeared to function as the network’s largest production node. Here police found a fully equipped clandestine laboratory, commercial-sized synthesis equipment, and vast stores of chemicals. The haul included more than 2,000 grams of MDMA and approximately five kilograms of fentanyl. Large volumes of precursor chemicals were also seized, including pyridine, propanoyl chloride, aniline, and 4-Piperidone — compounds central to industrial fentanyl synthesis.\nAfter the U.S. government placed strict controls on fentanyl precursors NPP and ANPP, Chinese suppliers shifted toward 4-Piperidone as the primary replacement. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has since designated 4-Piperidone as a List I chemical, describing it as a crucial precursor for fentanyl that cannot be substituted in the main synthesis routes. Both U.S. and UN authorities note that restrictions on downstream precursors have driven traffickers to exploit this earlier-stage chemical.\nLinked Langley addresses yielded manuals on drug synthesis, 8.3 grams of MDMA, laboratory equipment, handwritten notes, and $1,600 in cash found in a safe. At an Aldergrove home, officers seized commercial-scale equipment contaminated with fentanyl precursors. Officers also seized a Dodge Ram, a Chevrolet Tahoe, and a Snake River dump trailer allegedly used to store and transport chemicals.\nInside the Dodge Ram, which investigators linked to Escobar-Calderon, police found approximately one kilogram of 4-Piperidone. Investigators also recovered handwritten notes on illicit synthesis and keys that showed interconnections between the labs and the suspects.\nThe filing argues the properties, vehicles, and money are proceeds and instruments of unlawful activity, citing not only drug production but also laundering of criminal proceeds and failure to declare taxable income.\nThe forfeiture claim adds detail to a case first unveiled in March, when RCMP announced coordinated raids and described “academic and professional research-grade” labs outfitted for mass production. At a Vancouver press conference, Cpl. Arash Seyed said the bust had prevented millions of potentially lethal doses from reaching the streets, calling it evidence of “progressively enhanced scientific and technical expertise among transnational organized crime groups.”\n“The fentanyl production labs located in the cities of Pitt Meadows, Mission, and Aldergrove were equipped with specialized chemical processing equipment often found in academic and professional research facilities,” the RCMP said, “with one of the arrested individuals claiming to be a chemist with an advanced degree in organic chemistry.”\nBut Canadian officials also sought to reassure Washington.\n“There continues to be no evidence, in this case and others, that these labs are producing fentanyl for exportation into the United States,” said Assistant Commissioner David Teboul. That assurance has been challenged. A U.S. government source told The Bureau there is no clarity on how the RCMP determined that assertion, noting Canada’s own data shows it has emerged as a global fentanyl exporter, and that the volume of fentanyl precursors flooding into Vancouver’s port far exceeds the needs of Canada’s domestic market. The presence of apparently Chinese-sourced precursors, overseas lab equipment, and commercial-scale output suggests the network was positioned for broader distribution.\nThe Bureau’s assessment is that the network revealed in the forfeiture case fits a wider pattern. Chinese brokers, operating with tacit state oversight, dominate the supply of fentanyl precursors such as 4-Piperidone. Mexican cartels — particularly Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation — run production and export chains into North America. Iranian-linked transnational operators have been documented in connection to a number of facets of cartel distribution and broader intelligence activity that draws in Canadian-based gangsters involved in the fentanyl networks. In Canada, the Wolfpack Alliance has provided the connective tissue, bridging domestic gangs to Mexican cartels and global suppliers. The B.C. network appears to embody that model.\nThe Bureau is a reader-supported publication.\nTo receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n-\nInternational1 day ago\nVienna court says Sharia law may be used in civil disputes, sparking outrage\n-\nAgriculture2 days ago\nCanada should eliminate its supply management system—with or without Trump\n-\nBusiness1 day ago\nA Nation Built on Sand: How Canada Squanders Its Abundance\n-\nArtificial Intelligence2 days ago\nChina wrote the playbook on AI surveillance.

      "text": "It’s time to breathe a huge sigh of relief. For months, it had seemed that Donald Trump was far more involved with Jeffrey Epstein than he had let on. Witnesses discussed photos of Trump with young girls and stains on his pants, we heard about a lewd birthday message from Trump to Epstein, and the president himself suddenly and suspiciously did a U-Turn on releasing the Epstein files.\nBut, thankfully for the dignity of the nation, Ghislaine Maxwell has flown in to save his bacon. On 24 and 25 July, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general (also essentially Trump’s own personal lawyer) visited Maxwell in prison to interview her. Now the transcripts are out and, wouldn’t you know it, Trump is squeaky-clean!\nDuring the interview, Maxwell quickly turned into a Donald Trump hypewoman. She brought him up unprompted early in the interview and went on to lovebomb him throughout, saying he’s “a gentleman in all respects”. She underlined specifically that:\n“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody.”\nShe then explained that, actually, Trump and Epstein weren’t really that close anyway:\n“I don’t know how they met, and I don’t know how they became friends. I certainly saw them together and I remember the few times I observed them together, but they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendl. I think they were friendly like people are in social settings. I don’t … I don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of … I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance,”\nWow, she’s so helpful to the president! Trump couldn’t have hoped for more if he’d gone in with a plan to bribe her to exonerate him! In other, unrelated news, soon after the interview, Maxwell was transferred from her federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.\nWow, what a crazy coincidence\nNobody has managed to give a satisfactory explanation for why Maxwell was moved right after the interview, but c’mon. C’mooon. Dave Aronberg, former Democratic state attorney for Palm Beach County, practically rolled his eyes as he told CNN:\n“From what we see from this transcript, Trump is getting what he wants. She is saying that Trump didn’t do anything untoward, nothing criminal. That’s what Trump wants. Ideally, he’d also like names of Democrats who did do something wrong, because that’s what the Maga base has been promised.”\nWhatever else is going on, Maxwell has played her hand superbly. As arguably one of the most despised women on the planet, it’s not like she has to put her reputation on the line by humiliating herself by praising Trump, and she’s leveraged this worthless praise into an extended stay in a relatively luxurious Club Fed.\nI guess there’s a reason why Epstein kept her around as the logistics person and partner for his depraved pedophile ring and secluded child sex island. You just can’t buy strategic competence like that!\nPublished: Aug 23, 2025 07:18 am"

      "text": "Transcripts of the Trump administration's interview with Ghislaine Maxwell (left) were released late on Friday night. Photo / US District Court for the Southern District of New York\nThe full transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell’s interview with Donald Trump’s deputy attorney have been published.\nMaxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein, was interviewed by Todd Blanche in July.\nReleasing the full transcripts to the public appears to be an attemptto put an end to weeks’ worth of damaging stories which have dogged Donald Trump’s administration.\nThe US President has faced fierce criticism from his base for refusing to publish documents held by the Government on Epstein, the paedophile financier who died in 2019.\nOn Friday (local time), the Department of Justice released hundreds of pages of transcripts and audio recordings of the interview in what Blanche called “the interest of transparency”.\n“Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,” Blanche said.\nTrump ‘the perfect gentleman’\nTrump has faced immense political pressure over his former friendship with Epstein, whom he fell out with over a property deal in Palm Beach.\nCritics and supporters of the US President alike have called for him to release the so-called “Epstein files” – all of the files the Government holds on the late paedophile.\nAsked about her knowledge of Trump and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said she has no incriminating evidence against Donald Trump.\nShe said: “I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\n“The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nPrince Andrew and Epstein\nIn the recordings, Maxwell contradicted Prince Andrew’s claim that she introduced him to the paedophile Epstein.\n“First of all, let’s just state, I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew. I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I’ll start with that.”\nThe Duke was accused of sexually abusing one of Epstein’s first accusers, Virginia Giuffre, on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17. She had sued him for unspecified damages.\nThe case was settled by the Prince, who has always denied any wrongdoing. Giuffre died this year by suicide.\nDuring a Newsnight interview to address the accusations in 2019, Prince Andrew said the British socialite was the one who acquainted him with Epstein.\nDuchess of York ‘put the moves on Epstein’\nMaxwell claimed the Duchess of York, who she described as her “frenemy”, pursued Epstein.\nShe said: “I thought that Sarah was trying to put the moves on Jeffrey, if I’m being honest, and I thought the whole thing was annoying and I was pissed off.”\nShe said she believed the Duchess “liked Mr Epstein”.\nWhen asked why she thought so, Maxwell responded: “My female intuition.”\n‘Epstein never loved me’\nMaxwell told Todd Blanche her ex-boyfriend did not ever love her and that she wasn’t his “type”.\n“There was some indications that [Epstein] would actively tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from me, and that he never loved me and I wasn’t his type,” Maxwell said.\nThe pair had a romantic relationship, but continued to work together after breaking up, until his arrest in 2019.\nThe nature of the couple’s relationship was brought under the spotlight during Maxwell’s trial.\nIntimate pictures of the pair together, including the now-infamous photos of Maxwell giving Epstein a foot massage, were presented by attorneys for the US Government.\nSeveral witnesses testified that they thought the pair were a couple, while others believed they just had a business relationship.\nFinancier’s death was ‘no suicide’\nMaxwell stated that she does not believe Epstein died by suicide in prison in 2019.\nThe nature of Epstein’s death is a contentious point for many Trump supporters, who believe he was murdered in order to suppress in order to cover up a so-called “client list” of high-profile figures.\n“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she said.\nShe said she did not know who was behind his death but that it was not a difficult thing to arrange.\n“In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That’s about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”\nNo client list\nMaxwell also denied that Epstein maintained a “client list” or “black book”.\n“There is no list,” she told Blanche during the first day of their interviews.\nThe FBI and US Justice Department last month released a memo drawing the same conclusion.\n‘I do not remember’ Trump birthday message\nMaxwell did not recall Trump allegedly sending a lewd letter featuring a drawing of a nude woman for Epstein’s 50th birthday.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that Trump had submitted a note for an album Maxwell was assembling for her then boyfriend’s birthday, in which he told Epstein they had “certain things in common”.\nThe note allegedly concluded: “May every day be another wonderful secret.”\n“I do not remember,” Maxwell answered, when asked whether Trump had sent a message for Epstein’s 50th birthday. She added that she had not found a birthday letter from the President among her possessions in New York.\nHowever, she confirmed she had put together a book of birthday messages for Epstein and that the financier had told her: “I love that idea.”\nTrump has fiercely denied writing or sending the letter and has launched legal proceedings against the newspaper and its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch.\nName-drops, but no smoking guns\nIn addition to Trump and Prince Andrew, a number of high-profile individuals came up during Maxwell’s interview but she did not incriminate any of them.\nNaomi Campbell: “[Campbell] may have gone – well, she certainly – well, I believe she visited him in Palm Beach, and I believe she may have gone to the island and she may have gone to see his house in New York.”\nRobert F. Kennedy: “Bobby knew Mr Epstein,” Maxwell said. “We went on a trip together. Was – we went to – dinosaur-bone hunting in the Dakotas.”\nElon Musk: Asked whether Musk knew Epstein, Maxwell said: “I believe they did.” She pointed to emails seen in trial documents as the “only reason” she believed that they knew each other, rather than her memory.\nGeorge Soros: “I don’t think he [Soros] knew him [Epstein].”\nRichard Branson: “I think I remember that I went to Richard Branson’s island with Mr Epstein, and maybe he went another time, but I don’t – I wouldn’t characterise Richard Branson and him as friends, but he did go and I think I went with him”.\nSign up to Herald Premium Editor’s Picks, delivered straight to your inbox every Friday.

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has revealed in her interview with US Justice Department that she never witnessed US President Donald Trump engage in any “inappropriate” behaviour or any of the massage settings during his years-long friendship with the rich financer. The revelation was made in a transcript of the department's interview with Ghislaine Maxwell released by the the US Justice Department.\n“I actually never saw the President [Donald Trump] in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell was quoted as saying.\nShe said, “In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nThe transcripts and audio recordings spanned two days of discussions in late July between Maxwell and Todd Blanche, a former Trump defence lawyer now serving as the Justice Department's second-in-command.\nGhislaine Maxwell suggested a possibility of masseuses from the spa at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort giving private massages to Epstein.\nHowever, according to CNN, Maxwell emphasised that she never recalled any such incidents. She also clarified that she never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for a private massage for Epstein.\nThe transcript which is 337 pages long and spread across four different files provides deep insight about Epstien business and his relationship with Trump.\nAt one point, Maxwell, who is serving a 20 year sentence, distance herself from Epstien. \"I am not here to defend him,\" Maxwell said. She insisted, however, that she \"did not participate in that activity\" with underage girls.\nSpeaking about the allegation that Epstein abused underage girls, Maxwell said, \"I never saw that with them at all. I'm not saying that Mr. Epstein did not do those things... I don't feel comfortable saying that today, given what I now know to be true.\"\nMaxwell expressed admiration for Trump's government. She also suggested that Epstein and Trump were not \"close friends.\"\n\"I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now. And I like him, and I've always liked him. So that is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him,\" she said.\n\"I don't know Epstein's - if he had - whatever the nature of the President's friendship, if you will, or however you want to define that with Epstein, I was - never witnessed. I think they were friendly like people are in social settings. I don't think they were close friends,\" she added.\nAccording to the The New York Times, Epstein's victims and their families sharply denounced the interview, accusing Trump of cutting a favourable deal with a convicted sex offender who they say would say anything to protect herself and him.\nEpstein, a financier with wide-reaching political and social ties, was arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges involving minors.He died the same year in a Manhattan jail cell, a death officially ruled as suicide, though the case continues to fuel controversy over the extent of his network and the role of powerful figures.\n(With inputs from ANI)\nStay updated with the latest Trending, India , World and US news.

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell's interview on Epstein case released by DOJ. See highlights and full transcript.\nThe Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe transcripts — which run for over 300 pages — came after Blanche traveled to Florida last month to meet with Maxwell, following pushback over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case's fallout. The release of the transcripts came as the Justice Department also turned over thousands of pages of files in the Epstein case to the House Oversight Committee, which said it would publish, after child sexual abuse material and any information identifying victims is redacted.\nThe Justice Department also released audio recordings of the Blanche-Maxwell conversation.\nThe interview came as Maxwell serves a 20-year prison sentence on charges that she helped Epstein recruit and abuse underage victims. She is asking the Supreme Court to review her case, arguing she should be covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors cut with Epstein almost two decades ago.\nAt the outset, Blanche told Maxwell the interview was not part of a \"cooperation deal.\" He said that she had immunity during their conversations, meaning the government wouldn't use anything she said against her, but he made no promises to ask the judge in Maxwell's case for leniency. He did say that the government could prosecute her if she made false statements during the interview.\n\"By you meeting with us today, we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do anything,\" he said.\nWhat do the Maxwell-Blanche transcripts say?\nThroughout the interviews, Blanche asked Maxwell about her relationship with Epstein and others in the late financier's orbit. He also asked about some of the allegations made against her and Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\nIn some cases, the names of accusers appear to be redacted.\nMaxwell said she may have first met President Trump in 1990. She said her father, British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was \"friendly with him and liked him very much,\" and he was fond of Mr. Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump.\nLater in the interview, Blanche asked about Maxwell and Epstein's relationships with famous people, including Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me,\" adding that \"I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now.\" She also said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings,\" not private settings.\nShe said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"\nShe also claimed she \"can't ever recollect\" recruiting somebody from Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club to give Epstein a massage. Late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre had alleged that Maxwell recruited her while she worked at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump told reporters last month he cut off ties with Epstein after he \"stole\" employees from Mar-a-Lago, including Giuffre.\nShe also spoke about former President Bill Clinton, whom she claimed was \"my friend, not Epstein's friend.\" She noted that she attended Chelsea Clinton's wedding with her then-boyfriend, Ted Waitt. She said she did not believe Clinton ever received a massage while the former president was with Epstein. And she told Blanche that Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, but did not visit Epstein's private island.\nMaxwell did not appear to accuse Clinton or Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior.\nMaxwell also appears to address Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and a person whose name is redacted. From context, that person appears to be Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually assaulted her as a minor after she traveled to London with Epstein. Andrew had denied the allegations, but settled a lawsuit brought by Giuffre out of court.\nWhen asked about Andrew's relationship with the accuser, she responds, \"what's an even bigger word than bullshit?\" She claimed a famous photo showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre as Maxwell smiles in the background was \"fake.\" She said \"categorically\" that she \"never, at any time, set Andrew up to have relations with her or any other human being ever.\"\nBlanche asked her briefly about several other people whom she claimed to know, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Alan Dershowitz and now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with whom she said she went \"dinosaur bone hunting.\"\nIn a statement provided to CBS News on Saturday through a spokesperson, the Giuffre family, the family said they are \"outraged\" by what they heard, and alleged that: \"The content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for child sex trafficking.\"\n\"During DAG Todd Blanche's bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\" the Giuffre family's statement said. \"This travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\"\nThe Giuffre family also said that by sending Maxwell to a minimum security prison, the Justice Department sends \"a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded.\"\nMaxwell describes her relationship with Epstein\nIn 1991, Maxwell said she struck up a friendship with Epstein. Maxwell was asked by Blanche in detail about her sexual relationship with Epstein, which she says started in 1992. She told the deputy attorney general that it is a \"misnomer\" that she was with Epstein consistently as a partner, and that she did not know he had other girlfriends until the Epstein flight logs were released.\n\"Contemporaneously, I absolutely did not know,\" about other women Epstein was with, Maxwell said, adding that by 1999, their relationship had \"foundered.\"\nMaxwell told Blanche that despite their physical relationship ending, she was still being paid by the disgraced financier, and that the two occasionally shared a bed together as \"friends with benefits, if you will, just not sex.\"\nMaxwell said at first she was paid $25,000 a year to work for Epstein, starting in 1992, and by the end of the payments in 2009, she was being paid $250,000 per year. Between 2010 and Epstein's 2019 death, Maxwell said her relationship with him was \"almost nonexistent,\" though she acknowledges they exchanged occasional phone calls and emails.\nShe acknowledged to Blanche that she helped Epstein find people to give him massages at home — but she said she met them in \"legitimate spas\" and did not believe any of the people she found were under the age of 18. She also claimed it \"never would cross my mind\" that those people were asked to perform sexual favors for Epstein.\nAt other points, Blanche asked Maxwell about Epstein's career on Wall Street — a persistent focus of speculation. She noted former Victoria's Secret CEO Lex Wexner was \"one very famous\" financial client of Epstein's, and said former JPMorgan Chase banker Jes Staley was \"business partners\" with Epstein. But she said she was \"not part of Epstein's business world, except tangentially.\"\nMaxwell addresses Epstein's case — and death\nMaxwell told Blanche there is \"no list,\" referring to the conspiracy theory that Epstein maintained a black book of clients who engaged in sexual activity with minors on his properties.\nShe speculated that she does not believe that Epstein died by suicide in jail, but she also doesn't think anybody on the outside caused him to be killed. She noted that, in the prison where she served at the time, \"somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary\" (she was moved to a lower-security facility following the interview).\n\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said, adding that she does \"not have any reason to believe that\" he was killed to cover up information Epstein had.\n\"I also think it's ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target,\" Maxwell said.\nMaxwell said law enforcement did not contact her during an initial investigation into Epstein in Florida in the 2000s, and she didn't discuss the case with Epstein. That probe controversially ended with federal authorities in Miami agreeing not to prosecute him, in exchange for Epstein pleading guilty to prostitution in state court. That deal is now key to Maxwell's efforts to appeal her criminal conviction, as she claims she's covered by a clause in the non-prosecution agreement that covers \"any potential co-conspirators.\"\nMaxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus thanked the Trump administration for releasing the transcripts in a statement posted to X. He also insisted that Maxwell is innocent.\n\"Ms. Maxwell answered every question. She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question. She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanor and credibility are clear for anyone to hear,\" Markus wrote."

      "text": "On the same day that portions of the infamous Epstein Files were finally delivered under duress to Congress and the White House pulled every trick in the book to distract, the incarcerated and pardon seeking Ghislaine Maxwell may have just provided Donald Trump with the vindication he has sought about his relationship with the deceased financier and sex offender.\n“I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell told deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in a two-day interview on July 24-25 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida. The clip was widely replayed on CNN, MSNBC, the BBC and others. “I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Maxwell went on to say on the recording.\n“The president was never inappropriate with anybody.”\nWatch on Deadline\nMudding the waters more, Maxwell countered the official story and said “I do not believe” that Epstein “died by suicide” in 2019 while in custody – though she says she has no idea who killed him. Maxwell also praised Trump for “his extraordinary achievement” becoming President twice, and saying how much she “liked him.”\nOddly, undermining her credibility, Maxwell then offered an opinion on Trump and Epstein that runs in opposition to the video, photos, public remarks and more the two men made about each other for years up until the mid-2000s. “I think they were friendly like people are in social settings,” she told Blanche. “I don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of … I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.”\nThere was a lot about her own interactions with the well-connected Epstein that Maxwell didn’t seem recall in the exchange with Blanche and her own lawyer. For instance, despite photos to the contrary and her own trial a few years ago, Maxwell insisted she had no up-close evidence of her constant companion and the man she was successful prosecuted for procuring girls for with underage girls. “I never saw that with them at all,” she said last month, qualifying, “I’m not saying that Mr. Epstein did not do those things.”\nIn her factually challenged remarks about Trump, her on-again, off-again boyfriend’s death six years ago, denial there ever was an Epstein client list and mentions of former president Bill Clinton, Maxwell used circumspect language that was very similar to what was heard during 2021 sex-trafficking trial. In 2022, the scion of long dead UK press baron Robert Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years behind bars – – a sentence her lawyers have made no secret of wanting reexamined at the very least\nAfter months of the administration trying to talk about anything but Jeffery Epstein and refusing to release the files and more on the convicted pedophile, today’s pouring out of audio and transcripts of Maxwell’s conversations with ex-Trump personal lawyer Blanche caught many unawares.\nBlanche went online first with the news.\nUp on the Department of Justice website, the material was qualified with a statement that “Redactions of victim names and other identifying information have been applied.” The official word is it is only victims’ names that have been hidden from view. Though the president himself urged “transparency” today just before the Maxwell material was made public, it had previously been reported that Trump’s name in the Epstein documents itself had long been redacted.\nStill, with pages and pages of documents and tapes to download from the Department of Justice site, and comb over and to listen to for details, Maxwell’s see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil declarations quickly dominated an already busy news cycle.\nTrump friendly Fox News gave the release the least time, except to hammer home Maxwell’s nothing inappropriate comment about the man who was Epstein’s buddy for years. But truth be told, the Murdoch owned outlet hit the major points in a very tailored and overwhelming release by any name. Along with the BBC, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal (who saw many of its recent scoops on Trump and Epstein pushed back on by Maxwell) and others, the Warner Bros Discovery-owned CNN and the soon-to-be MS Now, MSNBC went for the shiny stuff first in the release.\nOnly later, were concerns about the Trump team’s frenzy to “control the Epstein narrative,” as MSNBC Weeknight put it, raised to the fore.\nIn that context, not long after the Maxwell material was unveiled, C-Span announced they were taking the big picture approach. The nonprofit public service network said it would “present the entire interview – over 9 hours in length –unedited and without interruption, as released by the DOJ” tonight starting at 8 pm ET. “The interview will repeat in its entirety on Saturday, August 23, 2025, at 1pmET,” C-Span added, noting too that “the full presentation also will be available anytime” on their website.\nThis hot August Friday wasn’t already a chock full of news with the DC home of former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton raided by the FBI early Friday.\nIn Trump’s typical flood the media zone tactic, that obvious retaliation against the aide who turned on Trump years ago was followed by the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host wandering around government gift shops and the perhaps soon to be renamed Kennedy Center and later promising a big Oval Office announcement. With the latest escalation of Russian attacks on Ukraine, troops in major American cities and interference with the Federal Reserve’s independence just a few topics of importance today, that self-styled “big announcement” turned out to be about the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw with a rambling improv Putin friendly press conference afterwards.\n“You got a lot of people that could be mentioned that are in those files that don’t deserve to be, because he knew everybody in Palm Beach,” Trump oddly said Friday, before going on to say “I don’t know anything about that” and calling the whole thing a “Democrat hoax.” Somewhere in there, in a near buried move, the U.S. government took a 10% stake in tech giant Intel and fired a bunch of top military officers .\nDon’t expect much damning to Trump to come out of those 33,000 pages of first Epstein documents the House oversight committee received today.\n“The committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for the committee chair, Rep James Comer, the Republican committee chair said today in a statement. The statement went on to add that the committee will also “consult” with the DOJ with the “to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations.”\nAs for Maxwell, very quickly after her immunity granted interviews with Blache, she was transferred without explanation from the low-security facility in the Sunshine Stat, to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.\nGuys, it’s well know that convicted child sex traffickers are very truthworthy people.\nBear in mind she’s a perjurer as well\nSome of us remember when the story first broke years ago. Trump’s name was all over it. I wonder if she addresses the over four thousand wire transfers Trump made to Epstein.\nRelease the Epstein Files.\nWhy should we believe anything she said in that interview with Donnie’s personal lawyer?\nYep. And that nice cushy transfer to Club Fed. No way anything happens without a gimme. The art of the deal, as we keep being reminded."

      "text": "The Justice Department on Friday released the long-awaited transcripts of a weeks-old interview it conducted with convicted Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe Maxwell interview was one of two steps the White House took to try and quell outrage over its handling of the Epstein files, which has rocked the administration for weeks and caused even many supporters of President Donald Trump to balk.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi and other officials had built up anticipation for the Epstein documents before pulling back on promises to release them. Trump has also made a series of false and misleading claims that have caused Epstein’s victims to suggest a cover-up.\nThe administration’s other big move – asking to unseal grand jury testimony – hasn’t amounted to much. In fact, two judges have suggested it was a “diversion” intended to look transparent without actually being so.\nThe Maxwell interview conducted by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, likewise, doesn’t add much to the public knowledge of Epstein. But there are some key points worth running through – particularly in the broader context of the administration’s botched handling of the matter.\nHere’s what to know from the transcript:\nMaxwell isn’t coming clean, which undercut the exercise\nThe Maxwell interview is the administration’s first significant release of information since its effort to close the matter blew up in its face last month.\n(Also on Friday, it sent Epstein documents to a House committee that had demanded them, but those aren’t public yet.)\nBut it was always a weird choice, given Maxwell is a convicted sex offender and her appeals are ongoing. The Justice Department in Trump’s first term also labeled her a brazen liar. What could she possibly add of value?\nNot a whole lot, it seems.\nThe big headlines are that Maxwell doesn’t implicate anybody – including Trump – in any wrongdoing and says Epstein didn’t have a client list. But those statements might carry more weight if Maxwell came clean about her and Epstein’s own misdeeds.\nShe clearly didn’t do that. In fact, she repeatedly cast doubt on them, too.\nShe denied that Epstein paid her millions of dollars to recruit young women for him. She denied witnessing any nonconsensual sex acts. And she denied seeing anything “inappropriate” from “any man” – seemingly including Epstein.\n“I never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate with a woman of any age,” Maxwell said. “I never saw inappropriate habits.”\nSome other Maxwell responses also call her credibility into question.\nIn another instance, Maxwell claimed Epstein didn’t have “inappropriate” cameras inside his New York, Caribbean, New Mexico and Paris residences. Cameras in his Palm Beach, Florida, house were used because money was being stolen. But Epstein’s seven-story townhouse in Manhattan was outfitted with cameras, the New York Times reported earlier this month. Several of Epstein’s victims have cited a network of hidden cameras.\nIn another instance, Maxwell indicated she didn’t recall recruiting a masseuse from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort – seemingly denying Virginia Giuffre’s claim that that’s where Maxwell recruited her.\n“I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember,” she said.\nBut the next day, Maxwell made a point to water down that denial.\n“I don’t remember anybody that I would have [recruited],” Maxwell said. “But it’s not impossible that I might have asked someone from there.”\nIf Maxwell wasn’t about to come clean about her own crimes, should we really have expected her to shed light on anything else?\nHer answer on Epstein’s suicide is likely to spur further questions\nWhile the interview didn’t shed much light, in one way it’s likely to fuel more questions.\nOn one key point, Maxwell aligned at least in part with those who have lodged conspiracy theories about Epstein, who died by suicide.\n“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” Maxwell said.\nMaxwell was asked to speculate on who might have killed Epstein, and she said she didn’t know.\nMaxwell did break from many of the theories about Epstein’s death, in that she said she didn’t believe he was killed because he was blackmailing people. Instead, she suggested it could have been an attack unrelated to that.\n“In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary,” Maxwell said. “That’s about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”\nBlanche seemed to take care to emphasize that distinction, repeatedly returning to it.\nThe administration has said that Epstein did die by suicide, but the information it has offered – including a jailhouse video – has led to questions about how definitive its proof is.\nMaxwell has obvious credibility problems and wouldn’t necessarily have any unique insight into how Epstein died. (She said she never called or visited him in jail.) But a recent poll showed Americans said 60%-12% that the government was “hiding information” about Epstein’s death.\nAnd now Epstein’s top accomplice apparently told the government it’s wrong, for whatever that’s worth.\nShe made a point to flatter Trump\nOne of the big questions in the runup to the interview was whether Maxwell was using it to try and win concessions from the Trump administration – and was tailoring her testimony accordingly.\nHer lawyer, David Markus, spent the weeks prior often saying nice things about Trump and even suggesting a possible pardon or legal intervention in her ongoing appeals.\nMaxwell was also recently moved to a lower-security prison camp that she, as a sex offender, doesn’t appear eligible for without a waiver. The administration still hasn’t explained how that happened, weeks later.\nAnd Maxwell’s testimony doesn’t exactly refute that she wants something from Trump.\nAt one point, she took a brief diversion to offer unsolicited praised of his political success.\n“I just want to say that I find – I – I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now,” Maxwell said. “And I like him, and I’ve always liked him.”\nTrump has also said nice things about Maxwell, including bizarrely wishing her well – repeatedly – after she was charged in 2020. He also repeatedly left open the possibility of pardoning her around the time she interviewed with Blanche, who is Trump’s former personal attorney.\nBlanche told Maxwell she had limited immunity for the interview, but he also said, “I’m not promising to do anything” for her.\nNames were named, and Maxwell rebuts Trump\nWhen the Justice Department said last month that it wouldn’t release more information, it cited a desire not to impugn people who haven’t been charged with crimes. Trump himself has repeatedly cited a desire to avoid doing that, including as recently as Friday afternoon.\nBut notably, the administration now appears to have relaxed that standard.\nThe transcripts redact only the names of victims and leave in the names of well-known people broached by Maxwell and Blanche.\nThat includes not only Trump and former President Bill Clinton, but also Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Harvey Weinstein, a former congressman and plenty of others. Maxwell mentioned some men getting massages but didn’t implicate anyone in wrongdoing.\nShe explicitly said she had never observed Trump getting a massage. Of Clinton, she said: “I don’t believe he did.” Of Kennedy, she said, “I never saw anything inappropriate with Mr. Kennedy.”\nShe also appeared to rebut one of Trump’s oft-stated claims about Epstein – that the 42nd president was actually closer to him than Trump was. Trump has repeatedly claimed Clinton went to Epstein’s island dozens of times – as many as 28.\nBut that appeared to rest on a complete misreading of the available information. And Maxwell said Clinton never once visited the island.\n“He never [did],” Maxwell said. “Absolutely never went. And I can be sure of that because there’s no way he would’ve gone – I don’t believe there’s any way that he would’ve gone to the island had I not been there.”\nBut again, Maxwell’s crimes call her testimony into question. While she denied seeing any man engage in inappropriate acts, she has in fact been convicted of participating in one man’s: Epstein’s."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell Reveals Whether She Believes Epstein Committed Suicide\nThe Justice Department on Friday released hours of audio and hundreds of pages of transcripts from two days of interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker and longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein.\nDuring the interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Maxwell stated bluntly: “I do not believe he died by suicide.” Epstein was found dead in his federal prison cell in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. Maxwell added she had “no idea” who might have been responsible for his death.\nMaxwell denied ever witnessing inappropriate behavior by Epstein’s associates. When directly asked if President Donald Trump or former President Bill Clinton ever acted improperly around women or underage girls, Maxwell gave an emphatic denial.\n“I never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate with a woman of any age,” Maxwell said. “Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me… I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him.”\nShe emphasized that during her time around Trump, she never saw him in a massage setting or acting inappropriately: “The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nMaxwell also rejected claims of a so-called “Epstein client list” and denied any blackmail activity. “Absolutely never, in any context,” she said when asked if she had witnessed wrongdoing from high-profile men.\nShe maintained her relationship with Epstein was distinct and often overstated by the media: “Everyone puts us together like a monolith. He literally had a separate life from me. I literally had a separate life from him.”\nMaxwell recounted interactions with a range of powerful individuals, including Elon Musk, Andrew Cuomo, Chris Cuomo, John Kerry, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, and current Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nAccording to her account, RFK Jr. once joined Epstein on a mid-1990s trip to the Dakotas in search of dinosaur bones. She said nothing inappropriate occurred on the trip.\nMaxwell also recalled traveling with Bill Clinton to Latin America but claimed she couldn’t remember the purpose of the trip. “It was an honor and a privilege,” she said, praising Clinton as “a former fantastic ex-president.”\nShortly after the interview documents were released, Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, issued a statement asserting her innocence: “Ghislaine Maxwell is innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case. She never committed or participated in sexual abuse against minors, or anyone else for that matter.”\nMaxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in Epstein’s abuse network and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. She was transferred to a lower-security facility following the interviews with the DOJ.\nPresident Trump has been asked repeatedly whether he would consider pardoning Maxwell.\nYou can find the full transcript here: https://www.justice.gov/maxwell-interview"

      "text": "Jeffrey Epstein’s imprisoned former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell repeatedly denied to the US Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released on Friday meant to distance the Republican president from the disgraced financier.\nThe Trump administration issued hundreds of pages of transcripts from interviews that deputy attorney general Todd Blanche conducted with Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex trafficking case.\nThe records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Mr Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Mr Blanche that she had observed Mr Trump engaged in any form of sexual behaviour.\nThe administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass.\nBy making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Mr Trump’s base even as they send Congress evidence that they had previously kept from view.\n“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript.\n“I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Mr Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.\nShe said she had often been to Mr Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, sometimes alone, but had not seen Mr Trump since the mid-2000s.\nAsked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Mr Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied: “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nThe British one-time socialite, who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Mr Blanche at a Florida courthouse.\nShe was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except for in the event of a false statement.\nAfter her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.\nNeither her lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, said in a social media post on Friday that Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted”.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victims’ information.\nThe case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financier’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including the Duke of York, former US president Bill Clinton and Mr Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before Epstein came under investigation.\nMaxwell told Mr Blanche that Mr Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein’s, and that she never saw him receive a massage – nor did she believe he ever did.\nThe only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they travelled on Epstein’s plane.\nShe also spoke glowingly of Andrew and dismissed as “rubbish” the late Virginia Giuffre’s claim that she was paid to have a relationship with him and that he had sex with her at Maxwell’s London home.\n“That would’ve been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,” Maxwell said.\n“And he didn’t, because I was there.”\nMaxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein’s conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role.\nThough she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she insisted she never understood that to “encompass children”.\n“I did see from when I met him, he was involved or – involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterize it, with women who were in their 20s,” she told Mr Blanche.\n“And then the slide to, you know, or younger looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behavior.”\nEpstein was arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York prison cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that attorney general Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government cover-up, an expectation driven in part by comments from officials including FBI director Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nMr Patel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI”.\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Ms Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Ms Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weeks-long review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department said last month that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted”.\nThe department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial”.\nFaced with fury from the base, Mr Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Ms Bondi about Epstein at a White House cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”.\nThe kerfuffle also created bitter divisions within the administration, as Ms Bondi and Mr Bongino angrily clashed at a White House meeting last month.\nMr Bongino was uncharacteristically silent on social media for several days after that."

She described a complex relationship that began as a casual friendship, became romantic for a brief period, and then evolved into a professional partnership.\nMaxwell says she initially served as a “general manager” for Epstein, overseeing his properties, including his New York City brownstone, a ranch in New Mexico, and his private island in the Caribbean, Little Saint James.\nShe claims her financial situation was starkly different from Epstein’s. After her father’s death, she says the family businesses collapsed and she was left with no money. Epstein employed her, and she states that her salary grew from a meager $25,000 a year to a quarter-million dollars annually.\nA significant portion of the interview focused on the nature of Epstein’s alleged abuses. Maxwell suggests that Epstein’s proclivity for abuse wasn’t present early in their relationship, but developed later, particularly after what she believes was an introduction to a new girlfriend in late 2000.\nREAD: DOJ Releases Ghislaine Maxwell Interview, Trump And Clinton Allegations Addressed\nMaxwell claimed this girlfriend, a self-described survivor of sexual abuse, played a pivotal role in recruiting masseuses for Epstein.\nMaxwell believes that Epstein’s behavior changed drastically in the late 1990s when he began taking testosterone. She claimed this made him more aggressive and may have intensified his desire for massages.\nShe denied any knowledge of Epstein abusing underage women or of him using hidden cameras to blackmail powerful men. Maxwell claims there were no secret cameras installed in any of Epstein’s residences or his plane, with the exception of one in the Palm Beach house, which she says was installed by local police to catch a thief.\nEpstein’s Network: The Clients and the Accusations of Blackmail\nMaxwell identified several high-profile individuals and clients in Epstein’s network, including:\n- Leon Black: Maxwell claims Epstein’s work for him was similar to what he did for Les Wexner.\n- Elizabeth Johnson: Maxwell describes her as a client from the mid-90s for whom Epstein handled business dealings and personal matters.\n- Jes Staley: She describes their relationship as both friendly and a business partnership.\nREAD: Trump Says Federal Anti-Crime Effort Will Eye Chicago, New York Following D.C. Operation\nMaxwell reiterated her belief that Epstein’s success was not a product of blackmail.\nShe told prosecutors that she was never aware of any clients receiving massages from underage women or being blackmailed. She claimed that the idea of a “black book” containing such information was a complete fabrication, born out of a scheme concocted by a disgraced law firm and an ambitious prosecutor.\nMaxwell further discussed her connections to several high-profile individuals:\nBill Clinton: She claims she became friendly with him through a mutual friend, not Epstein.\nDonald Trump: She recalls meeting him through her father and describes him as a “gentleman” who was “always very cordial and very kind” to her. She explicitly denied any knowledge of Trump ever receiving a massage or behaving inappropriately.\nPrince Andrew: Maxwell flatly denied introducing Epstein to Prince Andrew or Sarah Ferguson. She also provided a detailed explanation of why the infamous photo of Prince Andrew with a young woman in her London home was, in her view, a “fake photo” and why the events described could not have taken place. Maxwell claims she was an hour-and-a-half away from London, celebrating her mother’s 80th birthday at the time the photo was purportedly taken. She also said her London flat was so small that a sexual encounter in the bathroom would have been physically impossible.\nMaxwell also addressed the circumstances of Epstein’s death.\nShe stated that she does not believe he died by suicide, attributing his death to the mismanagement and dereliction of duty within the Bureau of Prisons and denied having any knowledge of an assassination plot by powerful individuals seeking to silence him.\nShe believes that if there had been a motive for murder, it would have been carried out much earlier when he was not in jail.\nThis story will be updated.\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism.

      "text": "(The Center Square) – The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday released the audio and transcript interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, “in the interest of transparency,” in which she claims President Donald Trump “never” acted “inappropriate.”\nDuring the two-day interview, Maxwell was interviewed by Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche about her and deceased financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s relationships with Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\nNotably, Maxwell denied the existence of a client list. She also denied that Epstein was engaging in blackmail or had ties with any intelligence agencies.\nIn the interview, Maxwell described the president as a “gentleman,” and did not implicate him in any wrongdoing.\n“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects,” said Maxwell.\nBlanche asked Maxwell about any interactions the president may have had with masseuses.\n“Did you ever hear Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with anybody in your world?” Blanche asked.\n“Absolutely never, in any context,” Maxwell responded.\nMaxwell was also asked about a report in the Wall Street Journal published in July alleging that Trump contributed a “bawdy” birthday letter as part of a leather-bound book compiled by Maxwell for Epstein’s 50th birthday. The president denied any letter, prompting him to file a libel lawsuit against the publication.\n“Do you remember President Trump submitting a letter or a card or a note?” Blanche asked.\n“I don't,” Maxwell replied.\n“Do you remember seeing that book or any portion of the letters in your discovery in New York?” Blanche pursued.\n“Yes… I remember there was – there were some portions of that book. But what surprised me – yeah. What surprised me was how few there were, because I thought if you had those, where are the rest? There was none of Mr. Trump,” said Maxwell.\nBlanche pressed Maxwell further.\n“And do you remember – but separate and apart from your discovery, do you remember one way or the other whether President Trump submitted a letter for his 50th birthday?” he asked.\n“I do not remember,” she responded.\n“And the article that references the letter talks about like a – sounds like either a naked – a picture of a naked woman or something like that. Do you have any recollection of that,” Blanche asked again.\n“I do not. But just – no, I don't,” Maxwell responded.\nMaxwell was also pressed on the relationship between Epstein, herself, and the Clintons.\n“Do you know whether, for example, President Clinton ever received a massage?” asked Blanche.\n“I don't believe he did,” she answered.\n“And what makes you say you don't believe he did?” Blanche asked.\n“Well, because I don't – so that's a good question. The time that Epstein and President Clinton spent together, the only times I believe – well, obviously they traveled. There was that, you know, the plane, they went on the plane 26 times or whatever. That would be one journey. So they spent time on the plane together, and I don't believe there was ever a massage on the plane. So that would've been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage. And he didn't, because I was there,” Maxwell claimed.\nMaxwell was also asked about several other prominent figures, including tech leaders, Hollywood entertainers, scientists and royalty."

He reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022.\nGiuffre, who accused Epstein of sexual abuse and sex trafficking and who later moved to Australia, took her own life in April this year.\nDoJ releases interview transcripts\nThe interviews with Maxwell were conducted by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Justice Department's second-in-command, and were released on Friday.\nThe release of the interviews comes as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent regarding the Epstein case.\n\"Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,\" said Blanche.\nAccording to the transcripts, the interviews were conducted on July 24.\nIn the days that followed, Maxwell was moved from her low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison in Texas.\nNeither her lawyers nor prison officials explained the reason for the move.\nEdited by: Karl Sexton"

      "text": "The News\nJeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell told the Justice Department last month during a series of interviews that she does not believe the late sex trafficker died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial.\n“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” Maxwell said at one point, though she added that she didn’t know who would have killed him. “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay — somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary.”\nMaxwell spoke with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche while serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein traffic underage girls, a conviction for which she continues to seek a pardon from President Donald Trump. The 300-plus pages of interview transcripts that DOJ released on Friday afternoon appear to contain no significant new information about some of Epstein’s other well-known contacts, including the president himself.\nMaxwell praised Trump’s “extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now” and said she has “always liked” him. She added that she never saw Trump “in any inappropriate setting in any way.”\nHer reference to Epstein’s death comes weeks after prominent conservatives criticized the Trump administration for declining to pursue further action in the Epstein case last month; the disgraced businessman remains the subject of conspiracy theories stemming from his network of influential associates.\nMaxwell often couldn’t recall certain conversations when discussing her long relationship with Epstein, but declared him to have kept “no client list.” She also sought to distance herself from Epstein’s illicit acts, at one point saying she wasn’t “saying that Mr. Epstein did not do those things.”\n“I don’t feel comfortable saying that today, given what I now know to be true,” she said, while arguing that she did not participate in illegal activity.\nKnow More\nFrustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi grew among prominent MAGA commentators and inside the administration after the DOJ and FBI released an unsigned two-page memo in early July, effectively declaring the case closed.\nPart of the frustration was over Bondi’s past comments — in February, she said on Fox News that a list of Epstein’s clients was on her “desk right now to review,” raising expectations among those who have long followed the case. Bondi later argued that she was more broadly referring to files waiting for review, as opposed to any specific “client list” he may have kept.\nTrump has acknowledged that he and Epstein were socially connected but said that he broke off contact with the sex trafficker about two decades ago because he “stole people that worked for me.”\nNotable\n- DOJ sent over a batch of Epstein files to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Friday."

The disgraced financier’s death was officially ruled a suicide.\nHis sudden death and previous connections to wealthy and powerful individuals — including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew — created a storm of conspiracy theories that persist to this day. They largely revolve around a “client list” and the potential to blackmail those on it.\nMaxwell, the former British socialite currently serving 20 years in jail for her role in Epstein’s sex trafficking operation, gave the testimony to Blanche over two days from July 24 at a courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida, near where she was then incarcerated.\nBlanche began his questioning concerning the death of Epstein by asking if Maxwell had been at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York during that period. To which Maxwell responded that she had not.\nBlanche clarified that her responses would be what she believed based on her relationship with and knowledge of Epstein over many years, to which she replied that there was another influence on her opinion regarding his death.\n“There's a third component to that,” she said, “Which is having experienced now, the mismanagement and inefficiencies and total dereliction of duty at the Bureau of Prisons.”\nBlanche acknowledged that and continued, saying that he wanted to be careful about asking her to speculate, because anybody could do that, and he didn’t believe that was fair to her.\nReferencing subsequent reports into the death of the late sex offender, Blanche said: “Do you — so you think he was — he did not die by suicide, given all the things we just talked about.”\nMaxwell replied: “I do not believe he died by suicide, no.”\nBlanche followed up: “And do you believe that — do you have any speculation or view of who killed him?”\nMaxwell said: “I — no, I don't.”\nThe deputy attorney general asked: “And I ask that because, if you don't believe that there's any truth to the allegations of blackmail or that he had kind of a list, or that he had reasons to have people hate him, why would somebody kill him in prison?”\nMaxwell replied: “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay — somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That's about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”\nBlanche said: “So that goes to the third reason, which is kind of the mismanagement,” to which Maxwell responded, “Yes.”\nNoting that she was referring to the “shortcomings of the Bureau of Prisons,” Blanche continued: “Which is a little bit different than my — from my question is, which is, do you think there was somebody on the outside of prison, so putting aside, what could happen on the inside on the outside of prison, who would -- who wanted him dead so badly that he would've, or she would've, you know, caused him to be killed on the inside?”\nMaxwell replied: “I think that's — I don't see that. I think, is it possible? Of course it's possible. But I don't know of any reason why, and I don't believe in the blackmail or in any of this. I don't think Epstein had a hit on like that. If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation.”\nBlanched asked: “You don't have any reason, firsthand knowledge, or even speculation, it sounds like, to think that he was … that he was killed to kind of silence him or to keep him from going public about people he knew about?”\nMaxwell responded: “I don't, no, because I think that is just part of the story that's been created that started back in 2008, '09.”\nHer answer refers back to the initial investigation into Epstein in Florida that began more than a decade before the federal charges against him and his death in custody.\nBlanche then said: “What is important to me is whether, you know, if — is the idea that he didn't die by suicide, that's one thing. But if to the extent that folks believe that he was murdered to keep him quiet or because he had information on rich and powerful people, that's what I — do you have any reason to believe that that's true?”\nMaxwell replied: “I do not have any reason to believe that. And I also think it's ludicrous, because if that — I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target.”\nAfter Maxwell’s two-day interview with the Department of Justice she was relocated to a minimum security prison camp in Texas.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Trump's DOJ releases Tallahassee Ghislaine Maxwell interview transcript. Here's what it said\nWASHINGTON − The Justice Department on Aug. 22 released transcripts of interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanch conducted last month in Tallahassee with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend and associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\"The President was never inappropriate with anybody,\" Maxwell says at one point in the two days of marathon interviews on July 24 and 25. \"In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\"\nThe release of the redacted documents was accompanied by digital audio files of the marathon interviews conducted by Blanche − the DOJ's No. 2 official and President Donald Trump's former personal defense lawyer − with Maxwell at the Leon County Courthouse near the FCI Tallahassee prison where she was serving 20 years for sex trafficking crimes linked to Epstein.\nThe Trump administration has been heavily criticized in recent weeks over its earlier refusal to release the massive trove of investigative records that the Justice Department and FBI possess in connection with the case. Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting prosecution on sex trafficking charges, prompting a wave of conspiracy theories about who else might be connected to the sex ring he allegedly operated with Maxwell's help.\nDavid Oscar Markus, Maxwell's lawyer who was present for the July 24 and 25 interviews, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\nCritics have said that Blanche's two days of interviews with Maxwell, without the case investigators and prosecutors, were likely an attempt to get the former British socialite – who is appealing her conviction – to absolve Trump of any wrongdoing.\nIn at least some portion of the interviews, Maxwell appears to do just that.\nIn 2021, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted of helping financier Jeffrey Epstein recruit, groom and abuse minor girls from about 1994 to about 2004, including girls as young as 14 years old. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.\nAlthough Trump and Epstein have both said they were longtime friends before the had a falling-out, Maxwell describes them this way: \"I think they were friendly like people arein social settings.\"\n\"I don't – I don't think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of – I don't recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance,\" she said referencing Epstein's residence. \"I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"\nAt another point, Maxwell tells Blanche how much she admires Trump.\n\"President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find – I – I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now,\" said Maxwell. \"And I like him, and I’ve always liked him.”\nFor full updates on this story, follow USA TODAY'S coverage here."

Nothing hidden.\nTake a look here:\nBREAKING🚨: The DOJ has released the complete transcript and audio of AG Blanche's proffer of Ms. Maxwell..\nBlanche says the audio is divided into segments to reflect breaks during the interview. Some segments are shorter than others. Shorter segments are a result of audio tests… pic.twitter.com/pVoOCS4i8r\n— Melissa Hallman (@dotconnectinga) August 22, 2025\nThe official Justice.gov links to all transcripts and audio files can be found here: https://www.justice.gov/maxwell-interview\nBut since that is wildly overwhelming and would take a lot of time to soak in, I've got a Top 10 list of the key takeaways summarized for you right here:\nTop 10 Biggest Takeaways from the Maxwell DOJ Interviews (July 24–25, 2025)\n1. Maxwell Wanted to Cooperate All Along\nShe claimed she had repeatedly asked to speak with the government since the early 2000s but was ignored — even before her indictment.\nIf true, this challenges the narrative that she was completely uncooperative until convicted.\n2. Robert Maxwell & Epstein Never Met\nMaxwell was emphatic that her father never knew or met Epstein.\nShe explained Robert Maxwell vetted Epstein through Bear Stearns contacts before allowing her to continue seeing him.\nThis undercuts theories that Epstein was linked to intelligence through Robert Maxwell.\n3. Epstein’s “Heart Condition” & Sexual Habits\nShe said Epstein claimed a heart condition that limited intercourse and pushed him toward “other sexual activities.”\nThis is one of the first direct explanations Maxwell has given about Epstein’s sex life, reframing his behavior medically rather than purely predatory.\n4. Relationship Was Less Romantic Than Believed\nMaxwell insisted she never lived full-time with Epstein, rarely spent nights in his New York residence, and that his “true partner” in the 1990s was Eva Andersson Dubin.\nThis contrasts with media portrayals of her as his constant romantic companion.\nADVERTISEMENT\n5. Maxwell’s Salary & Role as “General Manager”\nShe described herself as a salaried employee (starting at $25,000/year, later higher) and essentially a property manager for Epstein’s estates.\nThis reframing casts her more as a staffer than co-conspirator.\n6. The Money Question — She Denied $30M Were “Payments for Girls”\nDOJ pressed her about $18.3M (1999), $5M (2002), $7.4M (2007).\nMaxwell said those were tied to business ventures (real estate flips, exotic car trades, helicopters), not payments for trafficking.\nThis is a direct rejection of the prosecution’s central narrative.\n7. Maxwell’s Independent Ventures\nShe claimed she held Series 63/67 broker licenses, actively day-traded, and launched joint ventures with Epstein (real estate, luxury cars).\nThat detail of her actively trading Apple/Microsoft in the ’90s had not been highlighted before.\n8. High-Profile Contacts Clarified\nElon Musk: She met him around 2010 at Sergey Brin’s Caribbean birthday event, later at the Oscars. Said Epstein and Musk emailed, but she had no personal link.\nLes Wexner: Called him Epstein’s “closest friend” for years, but said Epstein kept her away from him, possibly lying about why.\nADVERTISEMENTTrump: Reiterated she never saw or heard any inappropriate behavior from him.\nThese specifics add context to longstanding speculation.\n9. Maxwell Claimed Epstein Misled & Isolated Her\nShe said discovery revealed Epstein told people to lie to her, concealed other women, and admitted “he never loved me and I wasn’t his type.”\nSuggests she is casting herself as another person deceived and used by Epstein.\n10. Explicit Denial of Recruitment Role\nWhen pressed, she categorically denied receiving money for recruiting underage girls, calling it “completely false.”\nShe admitted Epstein “took care of her” with salary and lifestyle but rejected the central allegation she was financially rewarded for trafficking.\nIn short:\nThe interviews provided the first detailed portrait of Maxwell’s own defense narrative:\nShe was Epstein’s manager/assistant, not recruiter.\nBig financial transfers were business-related, not criminal payoffs.\nADVERTISEMENTShe insists she tried to cooperate for decades.\nShe offered new detail on Epstein’s sex life, her limited romantic involvement, and clarified her links to high-profile figures.\nThe biggest question is probably what does she say about whether an Epstein List exists...\nAnd here is the summary on that point:\nDirect Mentions\nNowhere in either transcript does Maxwell explicitly confirm that there is an “Epstein client list.”\nThe DOJ attorneys asked her about specific names (Trump, Musk, Wexner, Cuomo, etc.), her financial ties, and whether she ever recruited women at certain places (e.g., Mar-a-Lago). But she was never asked, “Does a client list exist?” in those exact words.\nIndirect References\nShe repeatedly denied that she recruited girls for Epstein or that she was financially rewarded for doing so.\nWhen asked about the millions of dollars transferred to her, she insisted the money was for business ventures (real estate flips, luxury cars, helicopters) — not payments for trafficking or recruitment.\nOn names, she said she knew or had met various prominent people socially (e.g., Musk at Sergey Brin’s party, Cuomo through marriage ties) but stressed she had no personal knowledge of criminal behavior by them.\nShe also noted she learned about Epstein’s wider contacts (through flight logs and discovery documents) only after the fact, not contemporaneously.\nBottom Line\nMaxwell did not validate or authenticate the existence of a master “client list.”\nShe did acknowledge Epstein’s broad network of associates but consistently framed her own knowledge as social introductions, not trafficking connections.\nHer stance in these interviews is essentially: If such a “list” exists, I wasn’t the one maintaining it, and I didn’t personally know about or participate in it.\nThis is a Guest Post from our friends over at WLTReport."

The president was never inappropriate with anybody.\"\nMaxwell also recalled knowing about Mr Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said, according to the transcript.\nMaxwell said her father was fond of Mr Trump's then-wife, Ivana, \"because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from\".\nShe was sentenced in the US in June 2022 to 20 years in prison following her conviction on five counts of sex trafficking for luring young girls to massage rooms for Epstein to abuse. She has asked the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction.\nEpstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.\nTrump 'was always very cordial'\nHis case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories due to his and Maxwell's links to famous people like royals, presidents and billionaires, including Mr Trump. No one other than Epstein and Maxwell has been charged with crimes.\nMr Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During Maxwell's trial in 2021, Epstein's longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, said Mr Trump flew on Epstein's private plane several times. Mr Trump has denied flying on the plane.\nMaxwell, 63, said in her interview with the Justice Department that she never saw Mr Trump receive a massage.\nShe told Mr Blanche that Mr Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me\", adding: \"And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now.\"\nRead more: All we know about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein's 'friendship'\nMaxwell denies introducing Epstein to Prince Andrew\nMaxwell also denied in the interview that she had ever introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein, and that the Duke of York could not have had sex at her house with Virginia Giuffre.\nMs Giuffre, who died in April, sued the Duke of York for sexual abuse in August 2021, saying Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 and had been trafficked by Epstein.\nThe duke has repeatedly denied the claims, and he has not been charged with any criminal offences.\nIn March 2022, it was announced Ms Giuffre and Andrew had reached an out-of-court settlement - believed to include a \"substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights\".\nMaxwell told the Justice Department: \"I did not introduce [Epstein] to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I'll start with that.\"\nShe insisted Epstein and the duke met separately, and said \"I think Sarah [Ferguson] is the one that pushed that\", before saying that allegations Andrew had sex with Ms Giuffre were untrue, as she was at her mother's 80th birthday celebrations in the countryside outside the city.\nShe then claimed Ms Giuffre's allegation that she and Andrew had sexual contact in the bathroom of Maxwell's London flat was not true, as the room was not big enough.\nShe also claimed that an image of her standing alongside Andrew with his arm around Ms Giuffre's waist was \"literally a fake photo\".\nThe release of the transcript comes after Mr Trump has faced criticism from Republican supporters and Democrats over his Justice Department's decision not to release further details relating to Epstein, after the now US president promised to do so during the election.\nRead more: What you need to know about Trump, Epstein and the MAGA controversy\nThe Justice Department previously said a review of the Epstein case had found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and \"no credible evidence\" the jailed financier had blackmailed famous men.\nIn the transcript of the department's interview with Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend said that she is not aware of any Epstein 'client list'.\nAfter her interview in July, Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison camp in Bryan, Texas, by the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) after she was held at a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, that housed men and women.\nThe Texas camp houses solely female prisoners, the majority of whom are serving time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes.\nNeither Maxwell's lawyer nor the BOP gave a reason for the move.\nMaxwell's legal team have maintained that she was wrongly prosecuted and denied a fair trial, and have floated the idea of a pardon from Mr Trump.\nRead more from Sky News:\nTour bus crash kills and injures several people\nTrump critic has home raided by the FBI\nThe president said earlier this month that \"nobody\" had asked him about pardoning Maxwell, but insisted that he has \"the right to do it\".\nMr Trump said: \"I'm allowed to do it, but nobody's asked me to do it. I know nothing about it.

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell Told Trump’s DOJ She’s ‘Always Liked’ and ‘Admires’ Him\nGhislaine Maxwell understood the assignment.\nIn her recent interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the convicted sex trafficker and former Jeffrey Epstein accomplice made sure to flatter Donald Trump as much as possible, while saying nothing that might make the president look bad, as she publicly seeks a pardon.\n“As far as I’m concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” Maxwell told Blanche, who was previously Trump’s personal attorney. “And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him.” She added, “That is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him.”\nThe Justice Department on Friday released redacted transcripts of Blanche’s interview with Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. The release of the interview comes after weeks of public criticism over the Trump administration’s handling of evidence related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who allegedly committed suicide in prison during Trump’s first term.\nThe president, who was friends for years with Epstein, famously said in 2002: “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”\nDespite promising on the campaign trail he would release the so-called “Epstein files” as president — a longtime demand of the MAGA right — Trump and his administration have since tried to close the book on the subject. Trump on Friday called “the whole Epstein thing a Democrat hoax.”\nMaxwell was granted immunity to answer the Justice Department’s questions, which included several about Trump’s relationship with Epstein.\n“Did you ever observe President Trump receive a massage?” asked Blanche. Maxwell responded, “Never.”\nBlanche posed a similar question: “Did you ever hear Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with anybody in your world?”\n“Absolutely never, in any context,” Maxwell replied, in another moment she added that she believed she had only ever seen the men “in social settings,” and didn’t “recall any private settings.”\nBlanche also asked Maxwell about the salacious birthday note that Trump reportedly wrote to Epstein, in which he called Epstein “a pal,” and wrote: “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey.”\nTrump and his team furiously tried to kill the story before it was published by The Wall Street Journal, and Trump promptly sued the conservative newspaper, claiming the birthday note was “fake and nonexistent.”\nAsked if she remembered Trump submitting a letter or card for Epstein’s 50th birthday, Maxwell said, “I do not remember.” She said she didn’t recall asking Trump to submit such a card, but added that “Epstein also asked people himself directly.”\nMaxwell was separately asked about claims — including those made by Trump himself — that Epstein had poached young women from the staff of his Mar-a-Lago resort spa.\nMaxwell, who was often involved in recruiting and grooming the girls and young women that Epstein would go on to abuse, said she “never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember.”\nWhile Blanche was clear in the interview that their conversation was not tied to any sort of leniency agreement, and would not — at least for now — result in any action regarding her conviction, Trump has not fully discarded the possibility of a pardon.\n“Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon,” the president said in July. “But nobody’s approached me with it. Nobody’s asked me about it. It’s in the news, about that, that aspect of it.”"

By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release.\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. \"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said, according to the transcript. Maxwell said her father was fond of Trump's then-wife, Ivana, \"because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from.\"\nMaxwell, a onetime socialite who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at a Florida courthouse.\nAfter her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum security prison camp in Texas. Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.\nOutrage from conspiracy theorists\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a \"client list\" that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup, an expectation driven in part by comments from officials including FBI Director Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld. Patel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein's \"black book\" was under the \"direct control of the director of the FBI.\"\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified\" that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain. After the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a \"truckload\" of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\n'Hoax'\nBut after a weekslong review of evidence in the government's possession, the Justice Department said last month that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and \"only a fraction\" of it \"would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\"\nFaced with fury from the base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as \"weaklings\" supporters who he said were falling for the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"\nThe kerfuffle also created bitter divisions within the administration, as Bondi and Bongino angrily clashed at a White House meeting last month. Bongino was uncharacteristically silent on social media for several days after that."

The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump’s base even as they send Congress evidence that they had previously kept from view.\n“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nAnalysis: Epstein controversy is an American kaleidoscope of fraught but central issues\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.\nShe estimated that she hadn’t seen Trump since the mid-2000s, again in a social setting. Asked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nMaxwell, a onetime socialite who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse.\nBlanche prefaced the interview by saying Maxwell had been given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said. The only exceptions, he said, were if she lied or gave statements inconsistent with what she’d previously said.\nAfter her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.\nThe Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nExplainer: The Epstein files: Why it’s a big deal for MAGA and what’s happening\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government cover-up. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weekslong review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department said last month that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”\nFaced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”\nThe kerfuffle also created bitter divisions within the administration, as Bondi and Bongino angrily clashed at a White House meeting last month. Bongino was uncharacteristically silent on social media for several days after that."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell provided no incriminating information during meetings with deputy AG on high-profile individuals who interacted with Jeffrey Epstein, transcript shows\nMaxwell met with a top DOJ official for a two-day interview session last month.\nThe woman thought to have the most direct knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long sex-trafficking operation claims there was no client list, no blackmail scheme and -- to her knowledge -- no high-profile Epstein associates who committed illicit acts in connection with the notorious sex-offender's crimes.\nThat's according to an account provided by Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to a top official of the U.S. Department of Justice during a highly unusual two-day interview session last month, according to a transcript and audio of the conversation released Friday by the DOJ.\n\"There is no list,\" Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. \"I'm not aware of any blackmail. I never heard that. I never saw it, and I never imagined it.\"\nMaxwell told Blanche that during her time with Epstein -- which ranged from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s -- she never witnessed nor heard of any inappropriate or criminal activity by President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, nor any of the well-known men who associated with Epstein, according to the transcript.\nTrump, Maxwell said, was cordial and a \"gentleman in all respects\" in all of her interactions with him. She described Clinton as a \"truly extraordinary\" man and a \"fantastic ex-president,\" according to the transcript of the meetings, which took place at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tallahassee, Florida.\nThe 63-year old Maxwell, who has been incarcerated since her arrest in 2020, also claimed she had been misidentified by a key witness at her criminal trial and insisted she was not involved in the sexual exploitation of minors.\n\"I did introduce him to women. I did, but not underage women,\" she said. \"And I did look for masseuses, I did. I went to spas and if I met somebody who said she was a masseuse, I did not check their credentials.\"\nBlanche -- who previously served as a personal defense attorney to President Donald Trump -- announced his intention to speak with Maxwell in a social media post last month, as the Trump administration sought to quell the self-inflicted controversy surrounding its decision not to release the government's investigative files on Epstein, after repeatedly promising to do so.\nThe Department of Justice -- in an unsigned memo released last month explaining its decision -- said that a \"systematic review\" revealed no incriminating client list and no evidence \"that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties.\"\nMaxwell was granted limited immunity for the interview with Blanche -- meaning nothing she said could be used against her, unless she lied. She and her attorneys signed the agreement at the outset of each day of the interview session, the transcript shows.\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding and participating in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls, which involved a scheme to recruit young women and girls for massages of Epstein that turned sexual. Federal prosecutors in New York said Maxwell helped Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately abuse girls as young as 14.\nDespite her conviction at trial in 2021 -- where she declined to take the witness stand -- Maxwell claimed in her interview with Blanche that she had been wrongly accused and did not receive a fair trial. She maintained, as she had done previously in a 2016 deposition in a civil case, that she never recruited anyone underage to massage Epstein and never witnessed or participated in any criminal acts, according to the transcript.\n\"I have no memory ... of having seen anybody that resembles a young child, let's call it what it is, at that house giving him a massage at all,\" Maxwell said, in reference to Epstein's Palm Beach home.\n\"I saw him with a lot of masseuses. I never saw a single masseuse ever look unhappy or not come back or whatever,\" Maxwell said. \"So any time I saw anybody with him, they were happy to be with him.\"\nMaxwell was indicted in July 2020, during the first Trump administration. Her trial occurred in late 2021, while President Joe Biden was in the White House.\nFederal prosecutors charged Maxwell with perjury for alleged lies she told during the 2016 deposition. And the government repeatedly assailed her credibility during her criminal case, citing her \"willingness to lie brazenly under oath about her conduct,\" according to court records.\nThe perjury counts against her were eventually dropped after her conviction on the more serious charges.\nFollowing the release of the interview transcript, Brittany Henderson, an attorney who has represented scores of Epstein victims, said Maxwell's testimony should carry little weight.\n\"Ghislaine Maxwell was federally indicted on two perjury counts as a result of her testimony during her civil deposition. Having been convicted of sex trafficking, she is now in jail presumably hoping that she will receive a pardon from President Trump,\" Henderson said in a statement. \"I can't imagine that her testimony will be given much weight by anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of her involvement with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\nIn a statement, Maxwell's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said that Maxwell \"is innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case. She never committed or participated in sexual abuse against minors, or anyone else for that matter.\"\n\"The materials newly released by the Department of Justice make this clear. Ms. Maxwell answered every question. She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question,\" Markus said in the statement.\nBlanche's meeting with Maxwell came just days after the Justice Department fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York with the most detailed knowledge of the case. Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, led the criminal prosecution of Maxwell.\nThe tone of the conversation appeared cordial and non-confrontational, a review of the transcript shows, with Blanche frequently allowing space for Maxwell's lengthy critiques of the accounts of her accusers.\n\"I don't want you to be burdened,\" Blanche told Maxwell a few hours into the interview. \"I want you to just tell the truth the best you can. So I don't want you to be burdened by what people said at trial or what, you know, the press says about you.\"\nBlanche -- the top deputy to U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi --indicated that the goal of the Maxwell meeting was to determine if she had \"information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims,\" according to a July 22 statement posted to social media by the DOJ.\nAccording to sources familiar with internal deliberations that preceded the meeting with Maxwell, Blanche was encouraged by some top administration officials to seek information that could lead to criminal investigations that might quiet the outrage from some of Trump's most vocal supporters.\n\"The FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche wrote in the post. \"Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government. That changes now.\"\nThe transcript confirms previous ABC News reporting that it was Maxwell's legal team that initiated the request for the meeting.\n\"That's true and I did speak to [my lawyer] ... and did tell him that I would be very keen to talk to anyone because no one from the government at any time ever ... since the inception of the case, so dating back to the early 2000s, has ever spoken to me, and I, indeed, I believe ever reached out to me at any time to even speak to me,\" Maxwell said.\nMaxwell appealed her conviction but her attempts have thus far been unsuccessful. She now has a pending application before the U.S. Supreme Court to review her conviction. Her lawyers have stated that they have not yet asked President Trump to commute her sentence or to pardon her, but that Maxwell \"would welcome any relief.\"\nBlanche was accompanied by an FBI agent and another DOJ official and Maxwell was with three of her attorneys, according to the transcript.\nThe unusual meeting involving the nation's second-ranking law enforcement official and a convicted sex-trafficker evoked a strong response from some victims of Epstein and Maxwell.\nAnnie Farmer, one of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial, told a federal court last week that she and other victims \"unequivocally object to any potential leniency that the government may be considering for Maxwell.\"\nDuring nine hours of questioning over two days, Maxwell was quizzed by Blanche about dozens of famous people -- politicians, business titans and Hollywood stars -- who had previously been named as having associated with Epstein. The inquiries started broadly -- with Blanche asking if Maxwell or Epstein knew the people -- before asking if any of the high profile figures had done anything improper. And in each instance, Maxwell indicated that she had never witnessed nor heard about any alleged wrongdoing, the transcript shows\nMarkus told reporters after the meetings concluded that his client had been asked by Blanche about \"one hundred different people.\"\n\"She didn't hold anything back,\" Markus said.\nAmong those Blanche inquired about, according to the transcript, were tech billionaires Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman and Elon Musk; political figures Ehud Barak, Robert Kennedy Jr. and former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell; and celebrities Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and Naomi Campbell.\nThe rumored existence of an apocryphal \"Epstein client list\" has long fueled speculation of a \"deep state\" cover-up to protect an elite cabal of alleged participants in Epstein's crimes. Some of the most vocal purveyors of the theory -- including FBI Director Kash Patel and his top deputy Dan Bongino -- have since taken up prominent posts in the Trump administration.\nBut Maxwell said there was no such list and that she saw no indication that Epstein had obtained compromising information that he used to extort others.\n\"A man wants sexual favors, he will find that. They didn't have to come to Epstein for that,\" Maxwell said.\n\"[T]here's no list. There never was a list,\" she said. \"None that I ever heard of, none that I ever witnessed.\"\nAt one point in the interview, Maxwell likened the quest to find others complicit in Epstein's crimes to a dark period in early American history.\n\"So that narrative that was created and then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what -- basically this is like a Salem witch trial. People go and lost [sic] their minds for this thing,\" she said. \"I mean, it's bananas.\"\nSignificant portions of the interview were dedicated to inquiries about President Trump and ex-President Bill Clinton.\nBefore any allegations of sexual misconduct against Epstein surfaced in 2005, Trump and Clinton each spoke glowingly of Epstein, and court records have included documents and testimony indicating that -- at separate times -- both men flew with Epstein on his private jets.\nClinton's association with Epstein was first noted publicly in 2002, after reporters learned of the former president's journey that year on Epstein's jet for a humanitarian mission to multiple African nations. Clinton told New York magazine through a spokesman at the time that \"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science.\"\nIn that same article, Trump boasted of his friendship with Epstein, saying, \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy.\"\n\"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life,\" Trump told the magazine.\nMaxwell told Blanche she had a friendship with former President Clinton after being introduced by a mutual acquaintance, she said.\n\"President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend,\" she said. \"President Clinton liked me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth with Mr. Epstein.\"\nMaxwell said she had suggested to Epstein that he allow Clinton to use his private jumbo-jet to fly to multiple international destinations in Africa, Asia and Europe in the early 2000's, after the end of his presidency. Clinton, Maxwell said, had no particular interest in Epstein other than having the use of his plane.\n\"They met because of me and the plane was because of me,\" she said. \"I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein. He was just a rich guy with the plane.\"\nDespite President Trump's oft-repeated claims that Clinton had traveled more than 20 times to Little St. James -- Epstein's private U.S. Virgin Islands estate where much of Epstein's abuse is alleged to have occurred -- Maxwell said the former president had never been there and wouldn't have wanted to go, because he had no relationship with Epstein.\n\"He never, absolutely never went. And I can be sure of that because there's no way he would have gone. I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island had I not been there. Because I don't believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein,\" Maxwell told Blanche.\nBill Clinton has previously said through a spokesperson that he \"knew nothing\" about Epstein's crimes, had never visited the island, and that all the flights on Epstein's aircraft in 2002 and 2003 were associated with work for the Clinton Foundation.\nAs for the current president, Maxwell said that she first knew of Trump through her late father, who purchased the New York Daily News in 1991. She said she only saw Trump and Epstein, both native New Yorkers, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time because my father was very friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said. \"And I think, [it] should be said that he also very much liked [Trump's first wife] Ivana because she was also from Czechoslovakia where my dad was from.\"\nMaxwell said she only saw the two native New Yorkers, Trump and Epstein, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.\n\"I don't know how they met, and I don't know how they became friends. I certainly saw them together and I remember the few times I observed them together. But they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendly,\" Maxwell said.\nAnd at a time when her legal team has publicly signaled her hopes for a reprieve from the president, Maxwell expressed admiration for Trump.\n\"And as far as I am concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find -- I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming president now. And I like him. And I've always liked him,\" she said.\n\"And did you ever hear Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with anybody in your world? Blanche asked.\n\"Absolutely never, in any context,\" Maxwell replied.\nPublished reports in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal last month indicated that the decision not to release the Epstein files came after President Trump was informed in May that his name was among those that appeared multiple times in the documents. The president has denied that he was told his name appeared in the files.\nThe appearance of a name in the Epstein files is not evidence of illicit activity.\nPresident Trump has said he ended his association with Epstein before any allegations of sexual abuse were raised in Florida in the mid 2000s.\nTrump said in 2019, after Epstein's arrest for child sex trafficking, that he hadn't spoken to him in 15 years. More recently, the president has claimed he split with Epstein after discovering Epstein was allegedly poaching employees from the spa at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach.\nMaxwell was escorted from her prison cell in Tallahassee to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the two days of meetings with Blanche. A week later, she was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison camp for women in Texas, with no official explanation for the move.\nMaxwell is the Oxford-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell, the larger-than-life publishing baron whose rags-to-riches story captivated England. She lived an extravagant life among the British elite until her father's business empire collapsed in the wake of his death in 1991. She relocated to New York looking for a fresh start and was soon seen in the company of the mysterious multimillionaire Epstein.\nEpstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy and child sex trafficking. He died in custody a month later, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging."

      "text": "‘The President Was Never Inappropriate With Anybody,’ Maxwell Tells DOJ\nJustice Department releases Ghislaine Maxwell interviews amid lingering fallout from Epstein investigation.\nGhislaine Maxwell says she never saw any inappropriate behavior by President Trump, President Clinton or other high-profile figures during her time with her former paramour and business associate, deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to newly released audio recordings and transcripts from the Justice Department.\nAs she awaits a decision in her request for a new trial — or even a pardon — following a 20-year conviction for five counts of sex trafficking and conspiracy, Maxwell offered only positive recollections of the many glitterati, including President Trump, whom she met while connected to Epstein.\n“President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” Maxwell said. “I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him,” Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche during her two-day meetings conducted last month before her surprise transfer to a minimum-security prison in Texas.\nDescribing dozens of interactions, the former socialite discussed how she enjoyed visiting the president’s Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago; how she befriended President Clinton; how Epstein had difficulty having sex because of a heart condition; and how limited their sexual relationship was as a result. Maxwell also denied recruiting young women for Mr. Epstein from Mr. Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago estate.\n“I’ve never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago for that, as far as I remember. I can’t ever recollect doing that,” Maxwell told Mr. Blanche.\nWhen asked by Mr. Blanche if she ever witnessed Mr. Trump receiving a massage or heard Epstein discuss it, Maxwell responded, “Never.”\n“I actually never saw the President in any kind of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting of any kind. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects. The President was never inappropriate with anybody,” Maxwell told Mr. Blanche.\nShe also said she never saw a bawdy card sent to Epstein by Mr. Trump to mark Epstein’s 50th birthday. A recent Wall Street Journal article suggested Mr. Trump’s message was included in a leather-bound book Maxwell had assembled as a gift for Epstein.\nMaxwell estimated that Epstein and Mr. Clinton traveled on Epstein’s private plane about “26 times or whatever” but denied seeing Mr. Clinton receiving a massage.\n“They spent time on the plane together, and I don’t believe there was ever a massage on the plane. That would’ve been the only time I think President Clinton could have even received a massage — and he didn’t, because I was there,” Maxwell said.\nIn the opening moments of their July 24 interview, Mr. Blanche explained to Maxwell that the conversation “wasn’t a cooperation agreement.”\nHe added, “By you meeting with us today, we’re really just meeting. I’m not promising to do anything.”\nThe meeting, which she had prompted through her attorney, David Oscar Markus, was in Maxwell’s estimation the first time a government official spoke with her.\n“I did tell him that I would be very keen to talk to anyone, because no one from the government, at any time, ever in the — since the inception of the case, so dating back to the early 2000s, has ever spoken to me, and indeed, I believe ever reached out to me at any time to even speak to me. And that includes up to when I was indicted and prosecuted,” Maxwell told Mr. Blanche.\nThe Justice Department’s decision to release the interviews, which took place July 24 and July 25, follows weeks of unsuccessful attempts to compel the federal courts to release testimony and exhibits from Maxwell and Epstein’s respective grand jury hearings.\n“In the interest of transparency, @TheJusticeDept is releasing the complete transcript and audio of my proffer of Ms. Maxwell,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X Friday.\nThe release of the transcripts also comes after weeks of unsuccessful attempts by the Trump administration to divert attention from its handling of the Epstein investigation.\nLast month, the Justice Department and the FBI released a brief memo concluding they had no evidence that Epstein did not commit suicide or that he possessed a “client list” that he used to blackmail powerful people with whom he socialized. The announcement, coming after the Trump administration had promised major disclosures about Epstein — and coming from FBI leaders who’d previously, in the private sector, expressed strong beliefs that the government was covering up dark secrets about Epstein — caused distress among many MAGA supporters.\nMs. Bondi clarified her comments to Fox News, saying she was referring to an Epstein “file,” not a client list.\nThe Bureau of Prisons’s decision to move Maxwell, convicted in 2022 for her role in Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring — which involved victims below the legal age of consent — to Camp Bryan was considered by a federal prison consultant to be “highly unusual.”\nTo transfer Maxwell to Camp Bryan — which counts the Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, and a “Real Housewife,” Jen Shah, as inmates — from FCI Tallahassee would usually require a Personal Safety Factor waiver.\nIn the past, granting a PSF waiver to a sex offender was “virtually unheard of,” a federal prison consultant, Christopher Zoukis, tells the Sun.\nSince her transfer, BOP officials have enhanced Camp Bryan’s security capabilities by deploying its Counter Terrorism and Special Operations units to monitor threats and communications from both inside and outside the prison."

      "text": "Jeffrey Epstein’s imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday (August 22, 2025) meant to distance the Republican President from the disgraced financer.\nThe Trump administration issued hundreds of pages of transcripts from interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.\nThe records show Ms. Maxwell repeatedly showering Mr. Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Mr. Blanche that she had observed Mr. Trump engaged in any form of sexual behaviour.\nThe administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass.\nBy making public two days of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Mr. Trump’s base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view.\nAfter her interview with Mr. Blanche, Ms. Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction on allegations that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.\nHer trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein’s homes.\nNeither Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Marcus, said in a social media post Friday that Ms, Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.”\n“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Ms. Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.” Ms. Maxwell recalled knowing about Mr. Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. She said she often had been to Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, sometimes alone, but hadn’t seen Mr. Trump since the mid-2000s.\nAsked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Mr. Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Ms. Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.” Ms. Maxwell, a one-time socialite who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Mr. Blanche at a Florida courthouse.\nShe was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except for in the event of a false statement.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victim’s information.\nThe case had long captured public attention, in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Mr. Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before Epstein came under investigation.\nMs. Maxwell told Mr. Blanche that Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein’s, and that she never saw him receive a massage — nor did she believe he ever did. The only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they travelled on Epstein’s plane.\n“That would’ve been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,” Ms. Maxwell said. “And he didn’t, because I was there.” Ms. Maxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein’s conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she insisted she never understood that to “encompass children”.\n“I did see from when I met him; he was involved or — involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterise it, with women who were in their 20s,” she told Blanche. “And then the slide to, you know, or younger-looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behaviour.” Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration following a two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department last month that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist, and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup.\nThat expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.” The administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weeks-long review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department determined that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.” Faced with fury from his base, Mr. Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”. The Justice Department has responded to a subpoena from House lawmakers by pledging to turn over information.\nPublished - August 23, 2025 12:57 am IST"

      "text": "What we know\n- The Justice Department this afternoon released the transcript and audio of its July interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned former associate of Jeffrey Epstein. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, President Donald Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer, interviewed Maxwell over the course of two days last month.\n- Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by the late financier, insisted in the interview that she never witnessed Trump do anything inappropriate. In a separate line of questioning, she said former President Bill Clinton never went to Epstein's island.\n- Asked about a client list, Maxwell was adamant that no such document exists and that Epstein did not keep a “black book” with the names of famous people that he knew. She also said she does “not believe” Epstein died by suicide in a jail cell six years ago while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n- The transcript release comes amid a political firestorm over the Trump administration’s refusal to release a trove of documents related to Epstein's case. The White House has faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike, including several major figures in the MAGA media ecosystem.\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche asked Ghislaine Maxwell, the associate of Jeffrey Epstein, about the disgraced financier’s relationship with various prominent figures, including politicians, actors, and wealthy business executives, according to transcripts of her testimony the Justice Department released on Friday.\nMaxwell said that she had never witnessed any inappropriate conduct from any man, including former President Donald Trump, whose name appeared in the unsealed records and who has not been accused by authorities of any wrongdoing.\n“I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Maxwell said of Trump, whom she said “was never inappropriate with anybody.”\nMaxwell also said she “never saw anything inappropriate” from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., toward young women, adding that Kennedy knew Epstein from a trip they went on together.\nLogs released in Maxwell’s 2021 trial revealed that Kennedy was among those who traveled on Epstein’s plane, along with Trump and former President Bill Clinton.\nMaxwell testified that Clinton had “never” gone to Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and that she had no personal knowledge of a relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Epstein. However, Maxwell said she thought they did know each other and had communicated by email, “not from my memory” but based on recollections of findings that were made during discovery.\nMaxwell also denied that Epstein had maintained any sort of client list and said she was not aware of “any blackmail.”\nIn a two-page memo last month, the Justice Department said that it had conducted a “systematic review” of the data tied to Epstein’s case and had turned up no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list.’”\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was found guilty of sex trafficking in 2021.\nAfter sitting for the Justice Department’s interview, Maxwell was transferred to a minimum security federal prison camp about a week after she sat for her interview with Blanche.\nDavid Markus, Maxwell’s lawyer, said his client is “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case.”\nBrittany Henderson, an attorney for victims and survivors of Epstein’s sexual abuse, accused Maxwell of seeking clemency from Trump, saying in a statement that Maxwell was “presumably hoping that she will receive a pardon from President Trump.”\nThe transcripts follow ongoing criticism from some of Trump’s supporters who have demanded the release of records tied to Epstein’s case after Trump promoted conspiracy theories about Epstein’s death on the campaign trail last year and vowed to make the files public. In the months since taking office, Trump has attempted to distance himself from his earlier claims and has even disavowed those supporters who have called for more insight into the case.\nAddressing the speculation about Epstein’s death while in jail, Maxwell said she did not believe authorities — who have repeatedly held that Epstein committed suicide when he died while awaiting trial in 2019, nor did she think he was murdered to protect the secrets of powerful friends.\nThe FBI recently reaffirmed earlier findings shortly after Epstein’s death from the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, and in 2023 from the DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General.\nRead more of our live coverage of the transcript’s release below.\n'Vast majority' of subpoenaed Epstein docs released by DOJ are already public, House Democrat says\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., a member of the House Oversight Committee, said none of the documents included in the Justice Department’s first turnover of subpoenaed Epstein records are \"substantially new.\"\n\"It appears a vast majority of the documents today are already in the public record, and so these are court transcripts, reports, already things that we already knew,\" Garcia told MSNBC's Chris Hayes. \"Nothing substantially new that we know of yet.”\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Justice Department last month for all files related to the federal investigation into Epstein. Garcia said there are significantly \"more documents that have yet to be released.\"\nGarcia argued the Justice Department's release today of a transcript of Maxwell's testimony to federal prosecutors was meant to \"distract\" from its decision to only release a portion of the subpoenaed Epstein records, as opposed to the full, unredacted files requested by the committee.\n\"This release today, again, is to also distract from the broader question of why Pam Bondi and Donald Trump refused to release the full Epstein files,\" Garcia said.\nEpstein likely didn't have relationship with the Cuomos, Maxwell says\nMaxwell testified that she did not believe Epstein knew members of the Cuomo family, including television host Chris Cuomo, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his ex-wife, Kerry Kennedy.\nMaxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that she did not recall seeing members of the famous political family on Epstein's plane, his Palm Beach residence or his private island.\nMaxwell however said she was friends with Kerry Kennedy and met Andrew Cuomo on occasion through that relationship.\nMaxwell testified she has no knowledge of a relationship between Epstein and Musk\nMaxwell testified that she has no personal knowledge of a relationship between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Epstein, but said she thought they did know each other based on her memory of findings during discovery.\n\"I believe they did,\" Maxwell said. \"And the only reason I say that is not from my memory, but because I saw -- I think I saw -- my memory is that in discovery, they were communicating on email.\"\nMaxwell said that her memory is \"not as good as I would like it to be.\"\nKevin Spacey, Chris Tucker did not visit Epstein properties, Maxwell says\nMaxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that, to her knowledge, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker did not visit any of Epstein's properties, transcripts indicate.\nMaxwell couldn’t say the same for model Naomi Campbell, whose name has also appeared in unsealed records and was described by Maxwell as having a friendship with Epstein that was “independent” of her.\nThe actors and the supermodel were among the prominent figures whose names appeared in unsealed Epstein records, though none have been connected to any of Epstein's wrongdoing.\nHouse Oversight Committee begins getting Epstein files\nAround the same time the Justice Department released the Maxwell transcripts, the House Oversight Committee said it had received the first tranche of documents from the department related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.\n“The House Oversight Committee has received the Department of Justice’s first production of Epstein records pursuant to Chairman James Comer’s subpoena. The production contains thousands of pages of documents,\" the committee said in a statement.\n“The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted. The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations,” the statement said.\nIt's unclear when the material will be released, or how long it will take for DOJ to turn over the entire file.\nHillary Clinton did not 'associate' with Epstein, Maxwell said\nAsked if Epstein \"knew or had any sort of visit, dealings or associated with Hillary Clinton,\" Maxwell responded, \"I would say no.\"\nShe also said she'd never seen the two of them together.\nAsked if Epstein ever did any business with the Clintons, Maxwell said he may have given money to their foundation.\n\"I think he did do that. And that, I believe, the money that he may have given could have been independent of me,\" she said.\nMaxwell: 'I do not believe' Epstein died by suicide - or a hit\nMaxwell said she doesn't think Epstein killed himself, but doesn't believe he was killed to keep quiet about powerful friends either.\n\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Maxwell said.\nAsked if she had any speculation about who killed him, she said, \"I don't.\" Pressed on whether she believed he was murdered to \"keep him quiet\" because he had information about \"rich and powerful people,\" she said, \"I do not have any reason to believe that.\"\n\"And I also think it's ludicrous,\" she added, because if \"that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.\"\n\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said.\nEpstein's 2019 death in a federal jail cell while awaiting trial was ruled a suicide- a holding the FBI again affirmed in a controversial July memo.\n\"This conclusion is consistent with previous findings, including the August 19, 2019 autopsy findings of the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the November 2019 position of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with the investigation of federal correctional officers responsible for guarding Epstein, and the June 2023 conclusions of DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General,\" the memo said.\nThe memo sparked a furious backlash from some of Trump's supporters, because he and top allies had previously stoked conspiracy theories about Epstein's death.\nMaxwell said she 'never saw anything inappropriate' with Kennedy\nMaxwell said that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. knew Epstein because they went on a trip together, but said she “never saw anything inappropriate” with Kennedy and masseuses or young women.\nAsked directly whether she knew if Kennedy had ever received a massage from one of the masseuses, Maxwell said, \"I do not.\"\nPressed about Kennedy, Maxwell said, \"I mean, absolutely not,\" before broadly stating that she had never witnessed inappropriate behavior from any man.\n\"I never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate with a woman of any age. I never saw inappropriate habits,\" Maxwell said.\n\"Now, I’m not -- I’m not going to say hands or -- I mean, that to me is not inappropriate. Now, somebody’s inappropriate and mine may be different,\" she added.\nLogs released in Maxwell’s 2021 trial revealed that Kennedy was among those who traveled on Epstein's plane, along with Trump and former President Bill Clinton. They have all denied any wrongdoing.\nAttorney for Epstein victims says Maxwell is seeking pardon from Trump\nBrittany Henderson, an attorney for numerous Epstein victims and survivors, accused Maxwell of seeking clemency from President Donald Trump following the Justice Department's release of her testimony transcripts.\n“Ghislaine Maxwell was federally indicted on two perjury counts as a result of her testimony during her civil deposition. Having been convicted of sex trafficking, she is now in jail presumably hoping that she will receive a pardon from President Trump,\" Henderson said in a statement.\n\"I can’t imagine that her testimony will be given much weight by anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of her involvement with Jeffrey Epstein,\" she added.\nMaxwell says there is 'absolutely no' client list\nBlanche asked Maxwell if she knew whether Epstein maintained a \"black book\" or client list containing names of famous people that he knew.\n\"Yeah, there is no list. We'll start with that,\" Maxwell said.\nProdded further about a client list, Maxwell said: \"Absolutely no. There is no list. There is no, I’m not aware of any blackmail. I never heard that. I never saw it, and I never imagined it,\" Maxwell said.\nThe Justice Department said in a two-page memo last month that a \"systematic review\" of the data tied to Epstein's case had turned up no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list.’”\nClinton 'absolutely never' went to Epstein's island, Maxwell says\nBlanche asked Maxwell if Bill Clinton had ever gone to Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\"He never, absolutely never went,\" Maxwell responded. \"And I can be sure of that because there’s no way he would’ve gone. I don’t believe there’s any way that he would’ve gone to the island, had I not been there. Because I don’t believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.\"\nTrump has said repeatedly — including earlier today — that Clinton had visited the island \"28 times.\" Clinton has previously denied ever going there.\nMaxwell said she didn't believe Epstein communicated with intelligence agenices as a source\nMaxwell responded \"no\" when Blanche asked whether she knew Epstein to communicate with FBI agents as a source or otherwise.\nAsked whether he would have been likely to tell her if he was an FBI source, Maxwell said that he would have bragged about it.\n\"I think if he was for real, I think he would’ve bragged about it to me as a show off, because he could be a showoff. And if he wasn’t, he might have dropped it like he was cool. And I don’t think -- I don’t remember him doing either,\" Maxwell said.\n\"Now, with, again, the caveat that in his — before I met him, finding money, I think he may have suggested that there was some people who helped him, but that’s the only context that I recall that in,\" Maxwell added.\nAsked what she meant by \"finding money,\" Maxwell recalled that Epstein had shown her \"a photograph that he had with some African warlords or something,\" and that was her sole memory \"of something nefarious — not nefarious. I don’t even know if it was nefarious, but covert, I suppose, would be the word.\"\nAsked about other intelligence agencies, like the CIA or Defense Intelligence or any other law enforcement agency, Maxwell said, \"Okay. I don’t think so. I think that -- I don’t remember anything like that. I just don’t think he had the wherewithal,\" and that it was \"bull----.\"\nProsecutors, judge have questioned Maxwell's honesty\nThe prosecutors and judge involved in Maxwell's 2021 criminal trial blasted her for being dishonest and failing to accept responsibility for her actions.\n“The defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct, including some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has been and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes,” prosecutors wrote in one pretrial motion.\nThe judge who sentenced Maxwell to 20 years behind bars after she was found guilty of recruiting, grooming and trafficking multiple teenage girls for Epstein noted she refused take responsibility for her actions.\n“Ms. Maxwell today acknowledged the courage of the victims, talked about the pain and anguish they expressed, to some extent acknowledged the pain and suffering,” Judge Alison Nathan said at her sentencing, but “what wasn’t expressed was acceptance of responsibility.”\nMaxwell had at one point in the case been charged with perjury, alleging she made false statements in a deposition under oath in the 2016 civil case. The government declined to move forward with those charges after her sex trafficking conviction. Maxwell is appealing the conviction.\nMaxwell says she doesn't remember whether Trump submitted a message for Epstein's 50th birthday book\nAccording to newly released transcripts of his interview with Maxwell, Blanche asked whether she remembered the names of people who had sent letters to contribute to a 50th birthday album for Epstein in 2003.\n\"It’s been so long. I want to tell you, but I don’t remember,\" Maxwell said.\nBlanche was referring to a Wall Street Journal article that reported Trump was among those who submitted a letter to the book more than two decades ago. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and the president has denied submitting a letter.\nAsked if she remembered Trump submitting a letter, card or note, Maxwell responded: \"I don't.\"\nMaxwell was also asked whether she remembered seeing the book or any portion of the letters, and she said she did, but that \"there was nothing from President Trump.\"\nPressed again on whether President Trump had submitted a letter for Epstein's 50th birthday, Maxwell said, \"I do not remember.\"\nMaxwell also said she did not have a recollection of a letter containing a drawing of a naked woman.\nTrump sued the Journal last month for $10 billion in damages and a jury trial over the report.\nMaxwell was transferred to federal prison camp after interview\nMaxwell, who's serving a 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges, was transferred to a minimum security federal prison camp about a week after she sat for her interview with Blanche.\nMaxwell, 63, had been held at a low-security facility in Tallahassee, Florida, that housed men and women, but was transferred to a camp in Bryan, Texas, which houses only women. A majority of its inmates are serving time for nonviolent offenses and white-collar crimes.\nThe move outraged some former Bureau of Prisons officials who said she appeared to be getting special treatment. Bureau of Prisons rules require sex offenders to be held in at least a low-level security prison like FCI Tallahassee, unless they receive a waiver.\nMaxwell said she knew Trump before she knew Epstein\nMaxwell said she believes she first met Trump in 1990 — before she met Epstein.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" she said, referring to Robert Maxwell, who owned the New York Daily News at the time.\n\"President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find — I — I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him. So that is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him,\" she said.\nMaxwell said Epstein and Trump were \"friendly\" but \"I don't think they were close friends.\"\nMaxwell says she didn't see Epstein taking photos or videos of others for blackmail\nIn the interview with Blanche, Maxwell claimed she never saw Epstein taking photos or videos of other people to later blackmail them.\n\"Did you ever hear, when you were present for conversations that Mr. Epstein was having, or others were having, anybody accuse him of blackmailing them or of trying to extort them, because of something Mr. Epstein knew?\" Blanche asked.\n\"No,\" Maxwell replied.\nMaxwell's attorney insists she is 'innocent' and praises DOJ for releasing transcript\nDavid Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said his client is \"innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case.\"\n\"She never committed or participated in sexual abuse against minors, or anyone else for that matter. In fact, the government has admitted that it did not even consider her a conspirator during the extensive investigation into Epstein in the Southern District of Florida.

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- The woman thought to have the most direct knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long sex-trafficking operation claims there was no client list, no blackmail scheme and -- to her knowledge -- no high-profile Epstein associates who committed illicit acts in connection with the notorious sex-offender's crimes.\nThat's according to an account provided by Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to a top official of the U.S. Department of Justice during a highly unusual two-day interview session last month, according to a transcript and audio of the conversation released Friday by the DOJ.\n\"There is no list,\" Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. \"I'm not aware of any blackmail. I never heard that. I never saw it, and I never imagined it.\"\nMaxwell told Blanche that during her time with Epstein -- which ranged from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s -- she never witnessed nor heard of any inappropriate or criminal activity by President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, nor any of the well-known men who associated with Epstein, according to the transcript.\nTrump, Maxwell said, was cordial and a \"gentleman in all respects\" in all of her interactions with him. She described Clinton as a \"truly extraordinary\" man and a \"fantastic ex-president,\" according to the transcript of the meetings, which took place at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tallahassee, Florida.\nThe 63-year old Maxwell, who has been incarcerated since her arrest in 2020, also claimed she had been misidentified by a key witness at her criminal trial and insisted she was not involved in the sexual exploitation of minors.\n\"I did introduce him to women. I did, but not underage women,\" she said. \"And I did look for masseuses, I did. I went to spas and if I met somebody who said she was a masseuse, I did not check their credentials.\"\nBlanche -- who previously served as a personal defense attorney to President Donald Trump -- announced his intention to speak with Maxwell in a social media post last month, as the Trump administration sought to quell the self-inflicted controversy surrounding its decision not to release the government's investigative files on Epstein, after repeatedly promising to do so.\nThe Department of Justice -- in an unsigned memo released last month explaining its decision -- said that a \"systematic review\" revealed no incriminating client list and no evidence \"that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties.\"\nMaxwell was granted limited immunity for the interview with Blanche -- meaning nothing she said could be used against her, unless she lied. She and her attorneys signed the agreement at the outset of each day of the interview session, the transcript shows.\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding and participating in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls, which involved a scheme to recruit young women and girls for massages of Epstein that turned sexual. Federal prosecutors in New York said Maxwell helped Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately abuse girls as young as 14.\nDespite her conviction at trial in 2021 -- where she declined to take the witness stand -- Maxwell claimed in her interview with Blanche that she had been wrongly accused and did not receive a fair trial. She maintained, as she had done previously in a 2016 deposition in a civil case, that she never recruited anyone underage to massage Epstein and never witnessed or participated in any criminal acts, according to the transcript.\n\"I have no memory ... of having seen anybody that resembles a young child, let's call it what it is, at that house giving him a massage at all,\" Maxwell said, in reference to Epstein's Palm Beach home.\n\"I saw him with a lot of masseuses. I never saw a single masseuse ever look unhappy or not come back or whatever,\" Maxwell said. \"So any time I saw anybody with him, they were happy to be with him.\"\nMaxwell was indicted in July 2020, during the first Trump administration. Her trial occurred in late 2021, while President Joe Biden was in the White House.\nFederal prosecutors charged Maxwell with perjury for alleged lies she told during the 2016 deposition. And the government repeatedly assailed her credibility during her criminal case, citing her \"willingness to lie brazenly under oath about her conduct,\" according to court records.\nThe perjury counts against her were eventually dropped after her conviction on the more serious charges.\nBlanche's meeting with Maxwell came just days after the Justice Department fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York with the most detailed knowledge of the case. Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, led the criminal prosecution of Maxwell.\nThe tone of the conversation appeared cordial and non-confrontational, a review of the transcript shows, with Blanche frequently allowing space for Maxwell's lengthy critiques of the accounts of her accusers.\n\"I don't want you to be burdened,\" Blanche told Maxwell a few hours into the interview. \"I want you to just tell the truth the best you can. So I don't want you to be burdened by what people said at trial or what, you know, the press says about you.\"\nBlanche -- the top deputy to U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi --indicated that the goal of the Maxwell meeting was to determine if she had \"information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims,\" according to a July 22 statement posted to social media by the DOJ.\nAccording to sources familiar with internal deliberations that preceded the meeting with Maxwell, Blanche was encouraged by some top administration officials to seek information that could lead to criminal investigations that might quiet the outrage from some of Trump's most vocal supporters.\n\"The FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche wrote in the post. \"Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government. That changes now.\"\nThe transcript confirms previous ABC News reporting that it was Maxwell's legal team that initiated the request for the meeting.\n\"That's true and I did speak to (my lawyer) ... and did tell him that I would be very keen to talk to anyone because no one from the government at any time ever ... since the inception of the case, so dating back to the early 2000s, has ever spoken to me, and I, indeed, I believe ever reached out to me at any time to even speak to me,\" Maxwell said.\nMaxwell appealed her conviction but her attempts have thus far been unsuccessful. She now has a pending application before the U.S. Supreme Court to review her conviction. Her lawyers have stated that they have not yet asked President Trump to commute her sentence or to pardon her, but that Maxwell \"would welcome any relief.\"\nBlanche was accompanied by an FBI agent and another DOJ official and Maxwell was with three of her attorneys, according to the transcript.\nThe unusual meeting involving the nation's second-ranking law enforcement official and a convicted sex-trafficker evoked a strong response from some victims of Epstein and Maxwell.\nAnnie Farmer, one of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial, told a federal court last week that she and other victims \"unequivocally object to any potential leniency that the government may be considering for Maxwell.\"\nDuring nine hours of questioning over two days, Maxwell was quizzed by Blanche about dozens of famous people -- politicians, business titans and Hollywood stars -- who had previously been named as having associated with Epstein. The inquiries started broadly -- with Blanche asking if Maxwell or Epstein knew the people -- before asking if any of the high profile figures had done anything improper. And in each instance, Maxwell indicated that she had never witnessed nor heard about any alleged wrongdoing, the transcript shows\nMaxwell's attorney, David Markus, told reporters after the meetings concluded that his client had been asked by Blanche about \"one hundred different people.\"\n\"She didn't hold anything back,\" Markus said.\nAmong those Blanche inquired about, according to the transcript, were tech billionaires Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman and Elon Musk; political figures Ehud Barak, Robert Kennedy Jr. and the late U.S. Senator George Mitchell; and celebrities Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and Naomi Campbell.\nThe rumored existence of an apocryphal \"Epstein client list\" has long fueled speculation of a \"deep state\" cover-up to protect an elite cabal of alleged participants in Epstein's crimes. Some of the most vocal purveyors of the theory -- including FBI Director Kash Patel and his top deputy Dan Bongino -- have since taken up prominent posts in the Trump administration.\nBut Maxwell said there was no such list and that she saw no indication that Epstein had obtained compromising information that he used to extort others.\n\"A man wants sexual favors, he will find that. They didn't have to come to Epstein for that,\" Maxwell said.\n\"(T)here's no list. There never was a list,\" she said. \"None that I ever heard of, none that I ever witnessed.\"\nAt one point in the interview, Maxwell likened the quest to find others complicit in Epstein's crimes to a dark period in early American history.\n\"So that narrative that was created and then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what -- basically this is like a Salem witch trial. People go and lost (sic) their minds for this thing,\" she said. \"I mean, it's bananas.\"\nSignificant portions of the interview were dedicated to inquiries about President Trump and ex-President Bill Clinton.\nBefore any allegations of sexual misconduct against Epstein surfaced in 2005, Trump and Clinton each spoke glowingly of Epstein, and court records have included documents and testimony indicating that -- at separate times -- both men flew with Epstein on his private jets.\nClinton's association with Epstein was first noted publicly in 2002, after reporters learned of the former president's journey that year on Epstein's jet for a humanitarian mission to multiple African nations. Clinton told New York magazine through a spokesman at the time that \"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science.\"\nIn that same article, Trump boasted of his friendship with Epstein, saying, \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy.\"\n\"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life,\" Trump told the magazine.\nMaxwell told Blanche she had a friendship with former President Clinton after being introduced by a mutual acquaintance, she said.\n\"President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend,\" she said. \"President Clinton liked me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth with Mr. Epstein.\"\nMaxwell said she had suggested to Epstein that he allow Clinton to use his private jumbo-jet to fly to multiple international destinations in Africa, Asia and Europe in the early 2000's, after the end of his presidency. Clinton, Maxwell said, had no particular interest in Epstein other than having the use of his plane.\n\"They met because of me and the plane was because of me,\" she said. \"I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein. He was just a rich guy with the plane.\"\nDespite President Trump's oft-repeated claims that Clinton had traveled more than 20 times to Little St. James -- Epstein's private U.S. Virgin Islands estate where much of Epstein's abuse is alleged to have occurred -- Maxwell said the former president had never been there and wouldn't have wanted to go, because he had no relationship with Epstein.\n\"He never, absolutely never went. And I can be sure of that because there's no way he would have gone. I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island had I not been there. Because I don't believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein,\" Maxwell told Blanche.\nBill Clinton has previously said through a spokesperson that he \"knew nothing\" about Epstein's crimes, had never visited the island, and that all the flights on Epstein's aircraft in 2002 and 2003 were associated with work for the Clinton Foundation.\nAs for the current president, Maxwell said that she first knew of Trump through her late father, who purchased the New York Daily News in 1991. She said she only saw Trump and Epstein, both native New Yorkers, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time because my father was very friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said. \"And I think, (it) should be said that he also very much liked (Trump's first wife) Ivana because she was also from Czechoslovakia where my dad was from.\"\nMaxwell said she only saw the two native New Yorkers, Trump and Epstein, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.\n\"I don't know how they met, and I don't know how they became friends. I certainly saw them together and I remember the few times I observed them together. But they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendly,\" Maxwell said.\nAnd at a time when her legal team has publicly signaled her hopes for a reprieve from the president, Maxwell expressed admiration for Trump.\n\"And as far as I am concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find -- I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming president now. And I like him. And I've always liked him,\" she said.\n\"And did you ever hear Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with anybody in your world? Blanche asked.\n\"Absolutely never, in any context,\" Maxwell replied.\nPublished reports in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal last month indicated that the decision not to release the Epstein files came after President Trump was informed in May that his name was among those that appeared multiple times in the documents. The president has denied that he was told his name appeared in the files.\nThe appearance of a name in the Epstein files is not evidence of illicit activity.\nPresident Trump has said he ended his association with Epstein before any allegations of sexual abuse were raised in Florida in the mid 2000s.\nTrump said in 2019, after Epstein's arrest for child sex trafficking, that he hadn't spoken to him in 15 years. More recently, the president has claimed he split with Epstein after discovering Epstein was allegedly poaching employees from the spa at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach.\nMaxwell was escorted from her prison cell in Tallahassee to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the two days of meetings with Blanche. A week later, she was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison camp for women in Texas, with no official explanation for the move.\nMaxwell is the Oxford-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell, the larger-than-life publishing baron whose rags-to-riches story captivated England. She lived an extravagant life among the British elite until her father's business empire collapsed in the wake of his death in 1991. She relocated to New York looking for a fresh start and was soon seen in the company of the mysterious multimillionaire Epstein.\nEpstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy and child sex trafficking. He died in custody a month later, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging."

      "text": "Epstein's former girlfriend told Justice Department she did not see Trump act in 'inappropriate way'\nJeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday.\nRelated video above: Deputy AG Todd Blanche meets Maxwell lawyers amid Epstein files debate\nThe Trump administration issued hundreds of pages of transcripts from interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.\nRead the full transcripts here.\nThe records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior.\n“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.\nShe estimated that she hadn’t seen Trump since the mid-2000s, again in a social setting. Asked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nMaxwell, a onetime socialite who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse.\nBlanche prefaced the interview by saying Maxwell had been given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said. The only exceptions, he said, were if she lied or gave statements inconsistent with what she’d previously said.\nAfter her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.\nThe Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weekslong review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department said last month that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”\nFaced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”"

      "text": "Trump ‘was never inappropriate with anybody,’ Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell told DOJ\nWASHINGTON — The late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, told Justice Department officials last month that President Trump was “never inappropriate with anybody” in the time the disgraced financier and future commander in chief were friends.\nMaxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in December 2021 of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges, sat for two days of interviews led by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in Tallahassee, Fla., July 24 and 25.\n“I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Maxwell told Blanche, Trump’s former defense attorney, of her interactions with the president when he was a friend of Epstein in the ’90s and early 2000s.\nMaxwell, 63, provided virtually no new information on other boldfaced names associated with Epstein, including former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, former Harvard University President Larry Summers, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.\nAudio and transcripts of the interviews were released Friday as the Trump administration seeks to quash rampant speculation about Epstein, who was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell Aug. 10, 2019.\nThe UK-born Maxwell pushed back on almost every conspiratorial accusation leveled about Epstein since his 2008 guilty plea in Florida to soliciting sex from a minor, which saw him confined for 13 months — much of that time on work release.\nThose included allegations that Epstein had a so-called “client list” of rich and influential associates who were either involved with or blackmailed by the investor who operated a shadowy sex trafficking ring that preyed on girls as young as 14.\nMaxwell likened the claims to “a Salem witch trial” frenzy against powerful politicians like Clinton, who she said “never” visited Epstein’s “pedophile island” in the US Virgin Islands, despite claims to the contrary from an Epstein victim and a former Clinton aide.\n“That narrative that was created and then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what — basically this is like a Salem witch trial,” said Maxwell, who was transferred to a lower-security prison in Texas shortly after the interview.\n“People have gone and lost their minds for this thing. I understand that. But the issue is, how do you satisfy a mob who can’t understand the lifestyle? Because it’s like P. Diddy in redux on TV with Clintons and Trump,” Maxwell continued.\n“I mean, it’s — it’s bananas. And while some of it is real — he [Epstein] did do those things, I’m definitely not disputing that,” she added.\n“But this was a man, they didn’t even believe he had a real business. I happen to believe he did.\n“He’s not that interesting,” Maxwell summed up her former lover at one point.\n“He’s a disgusting guy who did terrible things to young kids.”\nMaxwell, who is seeking a pardon, did break with the official story on one point, saying of Epstein “I do not believe he died by suicide,” contradicting the conclusion of a July 6 memo released by the DOJ and FBI.\nShe added that it was “possible” the 66-year-old was targeted in his Manhattan jail by others, but she didn’t believe that his so-called “blackmail” was being avenged.\n“I don’t think Epstein had a hit on like that. If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,” she claimed.\n“In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay — somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That’s about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”\nMaxwell’s interview did little to resolve major outstanding matters of public debate, including the possibility that Epstein served as either a US or Israeli intelligence asset.\nMaxwell, whose father Robert was himself a reputed Mossad agent, said that she had “not deliberately” interacted with anyone from the Israeli spy force, but that she wouldn’t know if Epstein had.\n“I don’t believe so, but I wouldn’t know. I mean, I would be very surprised if he did,” she said, also saying “I don’t” know the nature of Barak’s relationship with Epstein, which featured about 30 documented interactions in 2013-2017 alone.\nMaxwell conceded that it was possible she lacks some information about Epstein’s associates due to willful ignorance.\n“They’re men that went and had a massage and maybe did something sexual. They’re men. I wasn’t in the room. I cannot tell you if that happened,” she said.\n“Nobody ever said to me, ‘Oh, you know, we had sexual intercourse’… I’d be like, ‘Okay, TMI, no, not my business.'”\nMaxwell aso said she lacked “full recollection” of the reasons why Epstein transferred her $30 million over the years.\nStart your day with all you need to know\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nThanks for signing up!\nThe revival of public interest in the case came this year after Attorney General Pam Bondi hyped looming bombshells — at one point appearing to indicate that there was a client list.\nBondi ultimately released the July memo asserting that there was no client list and that although Epstein allegedly victimized more than 1,000 women and girls, there was no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”\nThe AG also insisted in that memo that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted,” embroiling the president in a weeks-long rebellion from supporters who wanted more disclosures.\nThe Maxwell transcript release coincided with the Justice Department on Friday afternoon providing the Republican-led House Oversight Committee with “many other records” on the case, according to a spokeswoman.\n“It’s a lot — tens of thousands of pages,” the committee rep added of the first document production.\n“The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted. The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations.”\nTrump said Friday that he wants greater transparency and supports “keeping it totally open, I couldn’t care less,” insisting that he was being falsely attacked for his past association with Epstein as part of a Democrat-led “hoax.”"

      "text": "Following a two-day session with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month, the Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of its interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate and co-conspirator of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nDuring the interview, Maxwell, who is openly seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, praised the president repeatedly and said he was essentially a Boy Scout.\nMaxwell told Blanche that she “never” saw Trump in any compromising situation with Epstein and that she only saw the two men together in social settings, never privately.\n“I don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the President in any of ― I don’t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance. I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” she said.\nFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. Support our mission to keep us around for the next 20 — we can’t do this without you.\nTrump dispatched Blanche, formerly his personal attorney, to interview Maxwell last month amid a furor over the administration’s refusal to release the government’s files from its prosecution of Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking minors. Trump socialized for years with Epstein and Maxwell.\nMaxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison following her conviction in 2020 on sex trafficking charges as Epstein’s accomplice. At the time she was charged, Trump offered well wishes.\n“I just wish her well, frankly,” Trump said. “I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach.”\nNot only did Maxwell not see Trump receive any massages, but Maxwell also told Blanche that Epstein never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago, contrary to Trump’s recent statements that he cut ties with Epstein after doing exactly that.\nAs for the “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi once claimed she had sitting on her desk at the department, Maxwell said it was nonexistent.\nBlanche asked her whether she had a list or list of names “in her head” or “names that come to mind” of people she knew who did get massages when they were with Epstein.\n“No, there’s no list. There’s no list of people getting massages. I don’t have ― I can barely recall all the people. I can barely recall. I struggle to recall actual people that I met ... So I don’t have, and there’s no list. There was never a list. There was no ― or certainly none that I ever saw. None I ever heard of, none that I ever witnessed, none that I ― there’s no list. Has never been a list,” she said.\nWhen Maxwell was asked whether she ever heard Epstein discuss such a list, she said he “never” mentioned it.\nMaxwell also went out of her way to praise Trump for becoming president, essentially offering well wishes of her own to the man who could let her out of prison.\n“Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find ― I ― I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him. So that is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him,” she said.\nAnd as for the birthday card Trump reportedly gave Epstein with a racy note, that was not something Maxwell could recall.\n“I don’t remember,” she said.\nThe testimony with Blanche is extremely unusual; typically, it wouldn’t be a high-ranking Justice Department official who would conduct an interview like Maxwell’s but instead the prosecutors who worked her case.\nThe Justice Department has seemingly already let Maxwell enjoy some benefits of testifying to Blanche privately as the Epstein Files scandal rocked the Trump administration earlier this summer. They moved her from prison to a minimum-security prison camp, contrary to regulations requiring she be housed in a facility requiring at least “low” level security for sex offenders.\nThough the Justice Department said last month it wouldn’t release its files from the Epstein case, on Friday the department began sharing the material with the Republican-led House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena.\n“The production contains thousands of pages of documents,” a committee spokesperson said Friday, adding that the committee “intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted.”\nDemocrats have blasted Republicans’ plans to make piecemeal disclosures of the Epstein files and also the Justice Department’s unusual interview with Maxwell, especially in light of her favorable prison transfer.\nTrump said Friday in the Oval Office that the whole Epstein affair is a hoax.\n“You’ve got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said. “It’s a Democrat hoax. It’s just a hoax. The whole Epstein thing is a Democrat hoax.”\nTrump also claimed that former President Bill Clinton had been to Epstein’s private island 28 times, but Maxwell told Blanche he never did.\n“He never. Absolutely never went,” Maxwell said. “And I can be sure of that because there’s no way he would’ve gone ― I don’t believe there’s any way that he would’ve gone to the island, had I not been there. Because I don’t believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.”"

The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump’s base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view.\nAfter her interview with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction on allegations that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Her trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein’s homes.\nNeither Maxwell’s lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.”\n‘Never inappropriate’\n“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. She said she had been to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, sometimes alone, but hadn’t seen Trump since the mid-2000s.\nAsked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nMaxwell was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse. She was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except for in the event of a false statement.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victim’s information.\nHigh-profile contacts\nThe case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before Epstein came under investigation.\nMaxwell told Blanche that Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein’s, and that she never saw him receive a massage — nor did she believe he ever did. The only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they traveled on Epstein’s plane.\n“That would’ve been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,” Maxwell said. “And he didn’t, because I was there.”\nShe also spoke glowingly of Britain’s Prince Andrew and dismissed as “rubbish” the late Virginia Giuffre’s claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell’s London home.\nMaxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein’s conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she insisted she never understood that to “encompass children.”\n“I did see from when I met him, he was involved or -- involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterize it, with women who were in their 20s,” she told Blanche. “And then the slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behavior.”\nEpstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nA story that’s consumed the Justice Department\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration following a two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department last month that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist, and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weekslong review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department determined that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”\nFaced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”\nThe Justice Department has responded to a subpoena from House lawmakers by pledging to turn over information.\n____\nAssociated Press writer Adriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report."

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's longtime associate, in a move the Trump administration cast as a step toward transparency after weeks of backlash over its refusal to disclose other records in the sex-trafficking case.\nThe transcripts show Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2021 of luring teenage girls to be abused by Epstein, praising President Donald Trump and telling Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on July 24 that she never saw him engage in sexual behavior.\nThe Trump administration appeared eager to highlight those denials as the president faced renewed questions about his past ties to Epstein and criticism over the handling of case records. The transcripts cover two days and nine hours of questioning last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse.\nMaxwell said she never saw Trump in \"any inappropriate setting in any way,\" according to the transcripts.\n\"The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects,\" she said, according to the transcripts.\nWhy It Matters\nThe release comes as the administration grapples with anger from Trump supporters who had been primed to expect damaging revelations about prominent figures allegedly connected to Epstein. Officials have insisted many records remain under seal to protect victims, even as conspiracy theories over Epstein's death and alleged \"client lists\" continue to circulate.\nEpstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of soliciting prostitution and one count of soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18 in Florida. He was indicted on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors in 2019.\nEpstein was found dead in his cell at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center in 2019 while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide.\nThe DOJ and FBI announced they found no incriminating \"client list\" in their review of Epstein's case. The agencies also determined that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"\nIn the transcript released Friday, Maxwell tells Blanche that there is no Epstein client list.\nGhislaine Maxwell DOJ Transcript: What We Know\nMaxwell recalled possibly first meeting Trump around 1990, when her father, newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell, owned the New York Daily News. She noted her father's fondness for Trump's then-wife, Ivana Trump, who shared his Czechoslovakian background.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said, according to the transcript.\nMaxwell said she never saw Trump \"in any type of massage setting,\" according to the transcripts. When asked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump \"had done anything inappropriate with masseuses,\" she responded, \"Absolutely never, in any context,\" per the transcripts.\nFollowing the interview with Blanche, Maxwell was transferred from a low-security Florida federal prison to a minimum-security facility in Texas. Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons has explained the move.\nThe Epstein case continues to capture public attention due to Epstein's social connections with prominent figures, including former President Bill Clinton and Trump. Neither is accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\nTrump has said that his relationship with Epstein ended years before his 2019 indictment and death.\nMaxwell told Blanche that Clinton was originally her friend, not Epstein's, and said she never saw him receive a massage or believed he ever did. She said their only interactions were on roughly two dozen trips aboard Epstein's plane.\nMaxwell also praised Britain's Prince Andrew and rejected as \"rubbish\" late accuser Virginia Giuffre's claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell's London home.\nWas Ghislaine Maxwell pardoned?\nTrump has not pardoned Maxwell, but he has commented on the possibility while speaking to the press.\n\"Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody's approached me with it, nobody's asked me about it,\" Trump told reporters last month. \"It's in the news about that—that aspect of it, but right now it would be inappropriate to talk about it.\"\nTrump told reporters on Friday that he had directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to give \"everything\" the Department of Justice (DOJ) has on the Epstein files to the House Oversight Committee should they request them.\n\"I'm in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn't care less,\" Trump said in an apparent change in stance after fiercely resisting their release earlier this summer.\nWhat People Are Saying\nGhislaine Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, according to the transcripts released by the DOJ: \"President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find, I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now. And I like him, and I've always liked him. So that is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him.\"\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, in an X post announcing the transcripts: \"Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nMaxwell has appealed her case to the Supreme Court, but the Court has yet to decide whether it will hear the case.\nThis article includes reporting by the Associated Press.\nDo you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?

He was declared dead due to cardiac arrest on arrival at the hospital. Right-wing conspiracy theorists claimed that Epstein was actually murdered so he couldn’t disclose the names of powerful people on the alleged client list.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to release the full truth if he were reelected. Shortly after FBI Director Kash Patel was confirmed, he and his deputy, Dan Bongino, admitted that there was no evidence proving Epstein was murdered. The revelation angered Trump voters, who demanded the release of the complete files.\nTrump came under intense scrutiny for his friendship with Epstein, as revealed in photos and a card Trump signed for Epstein’s 50th birthday.\nAlso in the transcripts, Maxwell lavished praise on Trump and denied he was involved in Epstein’s nefarious behavior. Shortly after her meeting with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from a tough Florida prison to a “club fed” prison in Texas to serve out her 20-year prison sentence for being Epstein’s accomplice.\nWatch the clip above via MSNBC."

The only exceptions, he said, were if she lied or gave statements inconsistent with what she’d previously said.\nMaxwell told Blanche she believes she first met Trump in 1990 — before she met Epstein.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" she said, referring to Robert Maxwell, who owned the New York Daily News at the time.\n\"President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me.

We'll start with that,\" Maxwell said.\nProdded further about a client list, Maxwell said: \"Absolutely no. There is no list. There is no, I’m not aware of any blackmail. I never heard I never heard that. I never saw it, and I never, I never imagined it.\"\nBlanche asked Maxwell whether she remembered the names of people who had sent letters to contribute to a 50th birthday album for Epstein in 2003.\n\"It’s been so long. I want to tell you, but I don’t remember,\" Maxwell said.\nBlanche was referring to a Wall Street Journal article that reported Trump was among those who submitted a letter to the book more than two decades ago. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and the president has denied submitting a letter.\nAsked if she remembered Trump submitting a letter, card or note, Maxwell responded: \"I don't.\"\nMaxwell was also asked whether she remembered seeing the book or any portion of the letters in her discovery in New York, and she said she did, but that \"there was nothing from President Trump.\"\nPressed again on whether Trump had submitted a letter for Epstein's 50th birthday, Maxwell said, \"I do not remember.\" Maxwell also said she did not have a recollection of a letter containing a drawing of a naked woman.\nMaxwell responded \"no\" when Blanche asked whether she knew Epstein to communicate with FBI agents as a source or otherwise. Asked whether he would have been likely to tell her if he was an FBI source, Maxwell said that he would have bragged about it.\n\"I think if he was for real, I think he would’ve bragged about it to me as a show off, because he could be a showoff. And if he wasn’t, he might have dropped it like he was cool. And I don’t think -- I don’t remember him doing either,\" Maxwell said.\n\"Now, with, again, the caveat that in his — before I met him, finding money, I think he may have suggested that there was some people who helped him, but that’s the only context that I recall that in,\" Maxwell added.\nAsked what she meant by \"finding money,\" Maxwell recalled that Epstein had shown her \"a photograph that he had with some African warlords or something,\" and that was her sole memory \"of something nefarious — not nefarious. I don’t even know if it was nefarious, but covert, I suppose, would be the word.\"\nAsked about other intelligence agencies, like the CIA or Defense Intelligence or any other law enforcement agency, Maxwell said, \"OK. I don’t think so. I think that -- I don’t remember anything like that. I just don’t think he had the wherewithal,\" and that it was \"bulls---.\"\nMaxwell said she doesn't think Epstein killed himself, but doesn't believe he was killed to keep quiet about powerful friends either.\n\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Maxwell said.\nAsked if she had any speculation about who killed him, she said, \"I don't.\" Pressed on whether she believed he was murdered to \"keep him quiet\" because he had information about \"rich and powerful people,\" she said, \"I do not have any reason to believe that.\"\n\"And I also think it's ludicrous,\" she added, because if \"that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.\"\n\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said.\nBrittany Henderson, an attorney for numerous Epstein victims and survivors, accused Maxwell in a statement of seeking clemency from Trump.\n“Ghislaine Maxwell was federally indicted on two perjury counts as a result of her testimony during her civil deposition. Having been convicted of sex trafficking, she is now in jail presumably hoping that she will receive a pardon from President Trump,\" Henderson said in a statement.\n\"I can’t imagine that her testimony will be given much weight by anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of her involvement with Jeffrey Epstein,\" she added.\nAfter her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction on allegations that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Her trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's homes.\nNeither Maxwell's lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Marcus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.”\nMarkus went on to express gratitude to the Trump administration for publicizing the recordings of Maxwell's interview with Blanche.\n\"We are thankful to the Department of Justice and to Todd Blanche for making these tapes and transcripts public so that people can judge for themselves. We are also grateful to the President for his continued commitment to the truth in this matter and for refusing to cave to the mob,\" Markus said.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victim's information.\nThe Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup.

      "text": "Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday meant to distance the Republican president from the disgraced financer.\nThe Trump administration issued hundreds of pages of transcripts from interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.\nStream Los Angeles News for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\nIn the interest of transparency, @TheJusticeDept is releasing the complete transcript and audio of my proffer of Ms. Maxwell. The transcript and audio are linked below.https://t.co/TQW5migemm\n— Todd Blanche (@DAGToddBlanche) August 22, 2025\nThe records show Maxwell, a onetime socialite who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior. The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump’s base even as they send Congress evidence that they had previously kept from view.\nBlanche prefaced the interview by saying Maxwell had been given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said. The only exceptions, he said, were if she lied or gave statements inconsistent with what she’d previously said.\nMaxwell told Blanche she believes she first met Trump in 1990 — before she met Epstein.\n\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,\" she said, referring to Robert Maxwell, who owned the New York Daily News at the time.\n\"President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find — I — I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him. So that is the sum and substance of my entire relationship with him,\" she said, according to the transcript.\nMaxwell said Epstein and Trump were \"friendly\" but \"I don't think they were close friends.\"\nMaxwell told Blanche she never witnessed Trump or former President Bill Clinton doing anything inappropriate.\n“I actually never saw [Trump] in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said. “I never witnessed [Trump] in any inappropriate setting in any way. [Trump] was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nAsked if Clinton had ever gone to Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Maxwell said \"he never, absolutely never went.\"\n\"And I can be sure of that because there’s no way he would’ve gone,\" she continued. \"I don’t believe there’s any way that he would’ve gone to the island, had I not been there. Because I don’t believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.\"\nShe also spoke glowingly of Britain’s Prince Andrew and dismissed as “rubbish” the late Virginia Giuffre’s claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell’s London home.\nMaxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein’s conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she insisted she never understood that to “encompass children.”\nBlanche asked Maxwell if she knew whether Epstein maintained a \"black book\" or client list containing names of famous people that he knew.\n\"Yeah, there is no list. We'll start with that,\" Maxwell said.\nProdded further about a client list, Maxwell said: \"Absolutely no. There is no list. There is no, I’m not aware of any blackmail. I never heard I never heard that. I never saw it, and I never, I never imagined it.\"\nBlanche asked Maxwell whether she remembered the names of people who had sent letters to contribute to a 50th birthday album for Epstein in 2003.\n\"It’s been so long. I want to tell you, but I don’t remember,\" Maxwell said.\nBlanche was referring to a Wall Street Journal article that reported Trump was among those who submitted a letter to the book more than two decades ago. NBC News has not independently verified the documents, and the president has denied submitting a letter.\nAsked if she remembered Trump submitting a letter, card or note, Maxwell responded: \"I don't.\"\nMaxwell was also asked whether she remembered seeing the book or any portion of the letters in her discovery in New York, and she said she did, but that \"there was nothing from President Trump.\"\nPressed again on whether Trump had submitted a letter for Epstein's 50th birthday, Maxwell said, \"I do not remember.\" Maxwell also said she did not have a recollection of a letter containing a drawing of a naked woman.\nMaxwell responded \"no\" when Blanche asked whether she knew Epstein to communicate with FBI agents as a source or otherwise. Asked whether he would have been likely to tell her if he was an FBI source, Maxwell said that he would have bragged about it.\n\"I think if he was for real, I think he would’ve bragged about it to me as a show off, because he could be a showoff. And if he wasn’t, he might have dropped it like he was cool. And I don’t think -- I don’t remember him doing either,\" Maxwell said.\n\"Now, with, again, the caveat that in his — before I met him, finding money, I think he may have suggested that there was some people who helped him, but that’s the only context that I recall that in,\" Maxwell added.\nAsked what she meant by \"finding money,\" Maxwell recalled that Epstein had shown her \"a photograph that he had with some African warlords or something,\" and that was her sole memory \"of something nefarious — not nefarious. I don’t even know if it was nefarious, but covert, I suppose, would be the word.\"\nAsked about other intelligence agencies, like the CIA or Defense Intelligence or any other law enforcement agency, Maxwell said, \"OK. I don’t think so. I think that -- I don’t remember anything like that. I just don’t think he had the wherewithal,\" and that it was \"bulls---.\"\nMaxwell said she doesn't think Epstein killed himself, but doesn't believe he was killed to keep quiet about powerful friends either.\n\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Maxwell said.\nAsked if she had any speculation about who killed him, she said, \"I don't.\" Pressed on whether she believed he was murdered to \"keep him quiet\" because he had information about \"rich and powerful people,\" she said, \"I do not have any reason to believe that.\"\n\"And I also think it's ludicrous,\" she added, because if \"that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.\"\n\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said.\nBrittany Henderson, an attorney for numerous Epstein victims and survivors, accused Maxwell in a statement of seeking clemency from Trump.\n“Ghislaine Maxwell was federally indicted on two perjury counts as a result of her testimony during her civil deposition. Having been convicted of sex trafficking, she is now in jail presumably hoping that she will receive a pardon from President Trump,\" Henderson said in a statement.\n\"I can’t imagine that her testimony will be given much weight by anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of her involvement with Jeffrey Epstein,\" she added.\nAfter her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction on allegations that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Her trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's homes.\nNeither Maxwell's lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Marcus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was “innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.”\nMarkus went on to express gratitude to the Trump administration for publicizing the recordings of Maxwell's interview with Blanche.\n\"We are thankful to the Department of Justice and to Todd Blanche for making these tapes and transcripts public so that people can judge for themselves. We are also grateful to the President for his continued commitment to the truth in this matter and for refusing to cave to the mob,\" Markus said.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victim's information.\nThe Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weekslong review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department said last month that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”\nFaced with fury from the base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”\nThe kerfuffle also created bitter divisions within the administration, as Bondi and Bongino angrily clashed at a White House meeting last month. Bongino was uncharacteristically silent on social media for several days after that.\nThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates.\nThe full transcript of the interviews are below."

      "text": "DOJ Releases Ghislaine Maxwell Transcript in Rush to Appease MAGA Base\nDonald Trump’s administration is still struggling to contain the Epstein files fallout.\nThe Justice Department released transcripts of its interviews with Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\nThe DOJ interviewed Maxwell as part of its scramble to regain the public’s trust after botching the rollout of the Epstein files. After Attorney General Pam Bondi promised the release of Epstein’s so-called “client list,” she then went on to say the list did not exist.\nIn the interview, Maxwell reportedly recalled meeting Donald Trump in the early 1990s, when her father, Robert Maxwell, owned the New York Daily News.\n“I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript.\nIn the interview, Maxwell did not incriminate anyone, including former President Bill Clinton, Trump, or any other high-level officials. She also maintained that Epstein’s so-called “client list” did not exist.\n“There is no list. We’ll start with that,” Maxwell said.\nMaxwell’s interview aligns with what Bondi and the Trump administration have claimed about the list, but may disappoint those who expected a bombshell about Epstein’s supposed ties to influential politicians and decision-makers.\nMaxwell also took the opportunity to heap praise on Trump. “President Trump was always very cordial and kind to me,” she said. “I just want to say that I find—I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve liked him.”\nShe also said she “loved going” to Mar-a-Lago.\nOf Trump’s relationship with Epstein, she described it as mainly a social one, saying she’d never seen Trump at Epstein’s home or in a private setting. And certainly not getting a massage.\n“I actually never saw the president in any sort of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody,” she said.\nMaxwell also said she had never recruited a masseuse from Mar-a-Lago, contrary to what Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers, said about how she was trafficked by Maxwell in 2000. At 16, Giuffre worked as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago, where she was approached by Maxwell to work as a traveling masseuse, which led to her abuse by Epstein, Maxwell, and their associates, she said. Giuffre died by suicide this year.\nTrump, however, has told a different story. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One last month, Trump claimed that Epstein “stole” several of the president’s underage resort employees—including Giuffre.\nMaxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein traffic underage girls, isn’t necessarily the most trustworthy of sources. She’s angling for a pardon from the president and so would have every reason to downplay any ties between Trump and Epstein, who had a documented multidecade relationship.\nIt’s yet to be seen whether the transcripts will quiet MAGA’s uproar about the administration’s lack of transparency on the infamous sex trafficker.\nThis story has been updated."

      "text": "Topline\nJeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell told the Justice Department she never witnessed any “inappropriate” behavior by powerful men connected to Epstein—including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton—according to a full transcript of the interview, though her truthfulness remains under heavy scrutiny.\nKey Facts\nThe government released its full interview with Maxwell, which Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted over the course of two days in July, after the DOJ said it would interview Maxwell amid the public outcry over the agency refusing to release its full files on Epstein to the public.\nMaxwell—who has faced widespread scrutiny concerning her motivations in speaking with the government—absolved President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein in her testimony, telling Blanche she “never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way,” though she acknowledged Trump and Epstein were “friendly like people are in social settings.”\nShe also said she did not believe President Bill Clinton had ever received a massage from any of Epstein’s sex trafficking victims, and more broadly said she “never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate with a woman of any age.”\nMaxwell did not corroborate the Wall Street Journal’s report on Trump sending a “bawdy” letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday, telling Blanche she did not have any recollection of Trump submitting a letter.\nShe also categorically denied ever participating in Epstein’s abuse of underage women and insisted she did not know about his abuse of underage women, also denying a number of other reports regarding her involvement with Epstein, including that she recruited masseuses from Mar-a-Lago to work with Epstein, that she was paid $30 million as a “reward” for recruiting women for Epstein and that she introduced the financier to Prince Andrew.\nMaxwell’s attorney David Oscar Markus thanked Blanche for making the transcript public in a statement on X on Friday, claiming the full interview makes “clear” that his client “is innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case.”\nWhat To Watch For\nThe transcript of Maxwell’s interview is one of a number of Epstein-related files the Justice Department is turning over to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena for its documents on Epstein, with the DOJ turning over its first tranche of documents Friday afternoon. The committee told Forbes it intends to make those documents public, but it’s unclear when that will happen, as lawmakers intend to review the materials first to ensure victims’ identities are redacted.\nWhat Did Ghislaine Maxwell Say About Trump?\nMaxwell broadly praised the president in her interview with Blanche, saying she met the now-president through her father in the 1990s and she “like[s] him, and I've always liked him.” The Epstein associate told Blanche that “Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me” and praised his ascendance to the presidency, saying she “admire[s] his extraordinary achievement” in getting to the White House. Maxwell said she “certainly saw” Trump with Epstein and the two were “friendly,” and that both she and Epstein went to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. She didn’t believe the two men were “close friends,” however, and said she never saw Trump at Epstein’s house. When asked if Trump had ever received a massage from one of Epstein’s victims or done “anything inappropriate,” Maxwell responded, “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nWhy Ghislaine Maxwell's Testimony Is Problematic\nMaxwell’s testimony has come under scrutiny even before the transcript was released, due to the socialite’s history of alleged perjury. Maxwell was charged with perjury in 2020 for allegedly lying during a 2016 deposition in a civil lawsuit about Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse. The charges were later dropped after being separated from the other counts against Maxwell that eventually went to trial, as prosecutors agreed to drop the charges in exchange for Maxwell not pursuing a re-trial on her harsher sex trafficking charges. Maxwell has denied the perjury accusations. Her testimony has also raised questions due to the fact it could have been personally beneficial to her to say favorable things about Trump and absolve him from wrongdoing. Trump has not ruled out pardoning Maxwell, and she was moved to a different prison with much more minimal security following her interview. Her attorney Markus insisted following her DOJ interview that she had answered Blanche’s questions truthfully. Markus claimed Maxwell “wants to tell the truth” and argued there would not be a point to her lying, because anything she said could be “corroborated or disproven.”\nIs There An Epstein ‘client List’?\nMaxwell denied the existence of a so-called Epstein “client list” detailing the financier’s associates, telling Blanche, “There is no list.” The socialite claimed the existence of the list was a rumor that evolved out of efforts by other parties to detail evidence or names of people associated with Epstein, but there is no list Epstein created that details people involved with his crimes. Maxwell’s testimony is in line with other reports suggesting the “client list” does not exist, including by Miami Herald journalist Julie K. Brown, who broke the story about Epstein’s widespread sexual abuse.\nWhat Did Ghislaine Maxwell Say About Epstein’s Death?\nMaxwell told Blanche she does not believe Epstein’s 2019 death in prison was by suicide, countering the Justice Department’s statement earlier this summer asserting Epstein died by suicide and conspiracy theories suggesting he was murdered are false. “I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” Maxwell told Blanche, going on to say that while she does not know who could have killed Epstein, “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or ... somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary.”\nWhat Did Ghislaine Maxwell Say About Bill Clinton?\nMaxwell denied that Epstein was close friends with the former president, telling Blanche, “President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein’s friend.” She said she had “no memory” of Clinton being at Epstein’s properties, including the financier’s private island, and said she didn’t see any “warmth” between Epstein and Clinton. “I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein,” Maxwell told Blanche. “He was just a rich guy with a plane.” Clinton has long denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\nCould Maxwell Be Pardoned?\nIt remains to be seen if Maxwell could receive further benefits in exchange for her testimony to the DOJ, beyond her previous prison transfer to a minimal-security facility. Trump has so far declined to rule out that he could pardon Maxwell or commute her prison sentence, saying in July he “hadn’t thought” about doing so but was “allowed” to. The president has previously spoken favorably about Maxwell, and said after her 2020 arrest that he “wish[ed] her well.” Blanche told Maxwell at the start of her interview that while prosecutors gave her some immunity with her testimony—in that her comments can’t be used against her at trial—the agency was not promising her anything in exchange for her testimony. “The most important part of this agreement is that this isn't a cooperation agreement, meaning that by you meeting with us today, we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do anything,” Blanche told Maxwell.\nKey Background\nMaxwell has been identified as Epstein’s closest associate, and has been accused of helping Epstein recruit and abuse some of his alleged victims. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison on sex trafficking charges in connection with her work with Epstein, with victims testifying she was personally involved in Epstein’s scheme and groomed women that Epstein went on to abuse. Maxwell is still in the process of appealing her conviction. The DOJ announced Blanche would speak with Maxwell in July as an effort to quell the public outcry over how the agency had handled Epstein’s case, after the DOJ’s memo saying it would not release any further Epstein files to the public sparked a massive backlash from Trump’s base of supporters. In addition to speaking with Maxwell, the DOJ also sought to appease the public by asking courts to unseal grand jury materials in the cases against Maxwell and Epstein, which are believed to be much more limited in scope than the Epstein-related files the DOJ has in its possession. All three courts asked to unseal documents have now rejected the government’s requests."

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday meant to distance the Republican president from the disgraced financer.\nWhat You Need To Know\n- Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump\n- That's according to records released Friday meant to distance the Republican president from the disgraced financer\n- The Trump administration issued hundreds of pages of transcripts from interviews Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell last month\n- The administration has scrambled to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose records from the sex-trafficking case\nThe Trump administration issued transcripts from interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.\nThe records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior. The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump's base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view.\nAfter her interview with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas to continue serving a 20-year sentence for her 2021 conviction on allegations that she lured teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Her trial featured sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14 told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's homes.\nNeither Maxwell's lawyers nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move, but one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, said in a social media post Friday that Maxwell was \"innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted.\"\n\"I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,\" Maxwell said, according to the transcript. \"I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\"\nMaxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News. She said she had been to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, sometimes alone, but hadn't seen Trump since the mid-2000s.\nAsked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump \"had done anything inappropriate with masseuses\" or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, \"Absolutely never, in any context.\"\nMaxwell was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse. She was given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said except for in the event of a false statement.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department on Friday began sending to the House Oversight Committee records from the investigation that the panel says it intends to make public after removing victim's information.\nThe case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said he had a falling-out with Epstein years ago and well before Epstein came under investigation.\nMaxwell told Blanche that Clinton was initially her friend, not Epstein's, and that she never saw him receive a massage — nor did she believe he ever did. The only times they were together, she said, were the two dozen or so times they traveled on Epstein's plane.\n\"That would've been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage,\" Maxwell said. \"And he didn't, because I was there.\"\nShe also spoke glowingly of Britain's Prince Andrew and dismissed as \"rubbish\" the late Virginia Giuffre's claim that she was paid to have a relationship with Andrew and that he had sex with her at Maxwell's London home.\nMaxwell sought to distance herself from Epstein's conduct, repeatedly denying allegations made during her trial about her role. Though she acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women, she insisted she never understood that to \"encompass children.\"\n\"I did see from when I met him, he was involved or -- involved or friends with or whatever, however you want to characterize it, with women who were in their 20s,\" she told Blanche. \"And then the slide to, you know, 18 or younger looking women. But I never considered that this would encompass criminal behavior.\"\nEpstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.\nThe saga has consumed the Trump administration following a two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department last month that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a \"client list\" that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist, and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.\nThe announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.\nPatel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein's \"black book\" was under the \"direct control of the director of the FBI.\"\nThe administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified\" that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.\nAfter the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a \"truckload\" of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.\nBut after a weekslong review of evidence in the government's possession, the Justice Department determined that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and \"only a fraction\" of it \"would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\"\nFaced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as \"weaklings\" supporters who he said were falling for the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.\"\nThe Justice Department has responded to a subpoena from House lawmakers by pledging to turn over information."

In an era where trust in institutions is thinner than a dime, conservatives might see this as a rare nod to accountability, though the cynical among us will wonder about hidden motives.\nStill, the convergence of Maxwell’s interview and the Epstein files signals that the public may finally get a clearer, if still murky, view of a scandal that’s haunted powerful circles for far too long."

      "text": "by Brian Shilhavy\nEditor, Health Impact News\nConvicted child sex trafficker and associate of Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, was given immunity recently to talk to Trump’s DOJ about Jeffrey Epstein, and she was also offered a transfer out of her maximum security prison to a prison club in Texas instead.\nLate yesterday, the DOJ released the transcripts of their interview with her, and surprise of surprises, Maxwell declared that President Trump was a great guy, and never did anything inappropriate.\nApparently that’s all that was needed to convince MAGA Land, the word of a convicted child sex trafficker to “clear” Trump’s name.\nPresident Trump’s close allies are welcoming convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell telling top Justice Department officials she never witnessed him “in any inappropriate setting” with young girls in his history of dealings with Jeffrey Epstein.\nMAGA loyalists quickly began circulating passages of Maxwell’s interview transcript released by DOJ on Friday in which Epstein’s former girlfriend says she never witnessed the president committing any wrongdoing.\nIn an interviewing following the release of the transcripts, Laura Loomer, the activist and MAGA influencer, said she believes Maxwell’s testimony proves that Trump “has always been an honorable person” and the release of the transcript will ease any division among his supporters. (Source.)\nMaxwell will probably also be pardoned at the end of Trump’s term.\nImagine how all the victims of Maxwell and Epstein must feel right now.\nBen Meiselas has an update on this story. He concludes that Ghislaine Maxwell now has Trump leveraged and is basically running the White House and the prison camp where she is staying, as she had one other inmate complain about housing a violent sex offender in their cushy country club-like “prison” in Texas for non-violent criminals, and this fellow inmate was then allegedly shipped out to a more secure prison immediately to appease Maxwell.\nAlan MacLeod from MintPress News has published an excellent deep dive investigation this week about the Maxwell family and their ties to Israel and the intelligence agencies.\nThe CIA, Mossad, and Epstein: Unraveling the Intelligence Ties of The Maxwell Family\nby Alan MacLeod\nMintPress News\nWith speculation mounting that Trump could pardon her, MintPress profiles the family of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. From her media baron father, who acted as a high-level spy for Israel, her sister, working to push Tel Aviv’s interests in Silicon Valley, her brothers, who founded a dubious but highly influential anti-Islamic extremism think tank, and nephews in influential roles at the State Department and White House, the Maxwell clan have wide-ranging ties to U.S. and Israeli state power.\nThis is their story.\nRELEASING GHISLAINE, BURYING THE EPSTEIN FILES\nSpeculation is growing that Ghislaine Maxwell could soon be freed. Despite campaigning on the promise to release the Epstein Files, there are increasing signs that the Trump administration is considering pardoning the world’s most notorious convicted sex trafficker.\nLast month, Trump (who contemplated the idea in his first term in office) repeatedly refused to rule out a pardon, stating to journalists that “I’m allowed to do it.” Just days later, Maxwell was transferred across states to a minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas—a highly unusual practice. Neither women convicted of sex crimes nor those with more than 10 years remaining on their sentences are generally permitted to be transferred to such facilities. The move sparked equal measures of speculation and outrage.\nThe decision to relocate Maxwell came after somebody—potentially a source within her team itself—began leaking incriminating and embarrassing evidence linking Trump to Epstein. This included a birthday card Trump sent Epstein, featuring a hand-drawn nude woman, accompanied by the text: “Happy Birthday—and may every day be another wonderful secret.”\nFor years, Maxwell aided her partner Jeffrey Epstein in trafficking and raping girls and young women, creating a giant sex crime ring in the process. Epstein’s associates included billionaires, scientists, celebrities, and politicians, including President Trump, whom he considered his “closest friend.”\nIn 2021, two years after Epstein’s mysterious death in a Manhattan prison, Maxwell was found guilty of child sex trafficking offenses and was subsequently sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nThe news that Trump may soon free such an infamous criminal sent shockwaves through his base and drew charges of blatant corruption from the media. “Is there any reason to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell except to buy her silence?” ran the headline of one article in The Hill.\nMeanwhile, Tim Hogan, senior Democratic National Committee adviser, denounced what he claimed was a “government cover-up in real time.” “Donald Trump’s FBI, run by loyalist Kash Patel, redacted Trump’s name from the Epstein files—which have still not been released,” he said.\nROBERT MAXWELL: MEDIA TYCOON AND ISRAELI OPERATIVE\nWhile many of Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes have come to light, less well-known are her family’s myriad connections to both the U.S. and Israeli national security states. Chief among these are those of her father, disgraced media baron and early tech entrepreneur, Robert Maxwell.\nA Jewish refugee fleeing Hitler’s occupation of his native Czechoslovakia, Maxwell fought for Britain against Germany. After World War II, he used his Czech connections to help funnel arms to the nascent State of Israel, weapons that helped them win the 1948 war and carry out the Nakba, the ethnic cleansing of nearly 800,000 Palestinians.\nMaxwell’s biographers, Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon, write that he was first recruited by Israeli intelligence in the 1960s and began buying up Israeli tech corporations. Israel used these companies and their software to carry out spying and other clandestine operations around the globe.\nMaxwell amassed a vast business empire of 350 companies, employing 16,000 people. He owned an array of newspapers, including The New York Daily News, Britain’s Daily Mirror, and Maariv of Israel, in addition to some of the world’s most influential book and scientific publishing houses.\nWith business power came political power. He was elected to the U.K. parliament in 1964 and counted U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev among his closest friends.\nHe used this influence to advance Israeli interests, selling Israeli intelligence-gathering software to Russia, the U.S., the U.K., and many other countries. This software included a secret Israeli backdoor that allowed the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, to tap into classified information gathered by governments and intelligence agencies around the world.\nAt the same time, it was expanding its espionage capabilities, Israel was developing a secret nuclear weapons program. This project was exposed by Israeli peace activist Mordechai Vanunu, who, in 1986, leaked evidence to the British press. Maxwell—one of Britain’s most powerful press barons—spied on Vanunu, passing photographs and other information to the Israeli Embassy—intelligence that led to Vanunu’s international abduction by Mossad, and his subsequent imprisonment.\nHis death was also surrounded by controversy, similar to Epstein’s. In 1991, his lifeless body was found in the ocean, in what authorities ruled a bizarre accident whereby the tycoon had fallen from his luxury yacht. To this day, his children are split on whether they think he was murdered.\nThe rumors that Maxwell had, for decades, been acting as an Israeli “superspy” were all but confirmed by the lavish state funeral he received in Jerusalem. His body was interred at the Mount of Olives, one of the holiest sites in Judaism, the spot from which Jesus is said to have ascended to heaven.\nVirtually the entirety of elite Israeli society–both government and opposition–attended the event, including no fewer than six living heads of Israeli intelligence organizations. President Chaim Herzog himself performed the eulogy. Also speaking at the event was Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who stated that “Robert Maxwell has done more for Israel than can today be said.”\nIn the United Kingdom, however, he is remembered less fondly. A man with a fearsome reputation, Maxwell ruled his media business with an iron fist, in a similar vein to Rupert Murdoch (another individual with extremely close links to Israel). After his death, it transpired that he had stolen more than $500 million from his employees’ pension fund to bail out other failing companies in his empire, leaving many of his workforce’s retirement plans in tatters. As the newspaper, The Scotsman, remarked ten years later in 2001:\nIf [Maxwell] was despised in life, he was hated in death when it emerged he had stolen 440 million [pounds] from the pension fund of Mirror Group Newspapers. He was, officially, the biggest thief in British criminal history.”\nISABEL MAXWELL: ISRAEL’S WOMAN IN SILICON VALLEY\nEven before it had been published, Isabel Maxwell– Robert’s daughter and Ghislaine’s older sister– managed to obtain a copy of Thomas and Dillon’s biography. She immediately flew to Israel, The Times of London reported, where she showed it to a “family friend” and deputy director of Mossad, David Kimche. These actions did little to beat the book’s central allegation that her father was indeed a high-level Israeli “superspy.”\nIsabel has enjoyed a long and successful career in the tech industry. In 1992, along with her twin sister, Christine, she founded a company that developed one of the internet’s first search engines.\nAfter the pension scandal, however, she and her siblings shifted their focus to rebuilding every facet of their father’s collapsed business empire. The sisters sold the search engine, netting enormous profits.\nAs Israeli outlet Haaretz noted, in 2001, Isabel decided to dedicate her life to advancing the Jewish State’s interests, vowing to “work only on things involving Israel” as she “believes in Israel.” Described by former MintPress journalist and investigative reporter Whitney Webb as “Israel’s back door into Silicon Valley,” she has transformed herself into a key ambassador for the country in the tech world.\n“Maxwell created a unique niche for herself in [tech] as a liaison between Israeli companies in the initial development stages and private angel investors in the U.S. At the same time, she helps U.S. companies interested in opening development centers in Israel,” wrote local business newspaper, Globes. “She lives intensively, including innumerable flights back and forth between Tel Aviv and San Francisco,” it added.\nIsrael is known to be the source of much of the world’s most controversial spyware and hacking tools, used by repressive governments the world over to surveil, harass, and even kill political opponents. This includes the notorious Pegasus software, used by the government of Saudi Arabia to track Washington Post journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, before assassinating him in Türkiye.\nIsabel built on her father’s political connections. “My father was most influential in my life. He was a very accomplished man and achieved many of his goals during his life. I learned very much from him and have made many of his ways my own,” she said. This included developing intimate ties to a myriad of Israeli leaders, including Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s closest associates.\nDuring the 2000s, she was a regular participant at the Herzliya Conference, an annual, closed-door gathering of the West’s most senior political, security and intelligence officials, in addition to being a “technology pioneer” at the World Economic Forum.\nShe was also placed on the board of the Israeli government-funded Shimon Peres Center for Peace and Innovation and the American Friends of the Yitzhak Rabin Center for Israel Studies, two organizations closely associated with those former Israeli prime ministers.\nIn 2001, she became the CEO of iCognito, taking the job, in her words, “because it [the company] is in Israel, and because of its technology.” The technology in question was aimed at keeping children safe online—highly ironic, given that her sister was actively trafficking and abusing minors throughout that period.\nIsabel was a much more serious and accomplished individual than Ghislaine. As Haaretz noted:\nWhile her younger sister, Ghislaine, makes the gossip columns after breakfasting with Bill Clinton or because of her ties with another close friend, Britain’s Prince Andrew, Isabel wants to show photos taken of herself with the grand mufti of Egypt, or with Bedouin in a tent, or of visits to a Gaza refugee camp.”\nIn 1997, Isabel was appointed president of the Israeli tech security firm, Commtouch. Thanks to her connections, Commtouch was able to secure investment from many of the most prominent players in Silicon Valley, including Bill Gates, a close associate of both the Maxwell family and Jeffrey Epstein himself.\nCHRISTINE MAXWELL: FUNDED BY ISRAEL?\nIsabel’s twin sister, Christine, is no less accomplished. A veteran of the publishing and tech industries, she co-founded data analytics firm Chiliad. As CEO, she helped oversee the production of a massive “counterterrorism” database that the company sold to the FBI during the height of the War on Terror. The software helped the Bush administration crack down on Muslim Americans and tear down domestic civil liberties in the wake of 9/11 and the PATRIOT Act. Today, she is the leader and co-founder of another big data corporation, Techtonic Insight.\nLike her sister and father, Christine has a close relationship with the State of Israel. She is currently a fellow at the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP), where, her biography states,\nShe works to promote innovative academic research that leverages enabling technologies to empower proactive understanding and combatting the great dangers of contemporary antisemitism, and enhancing the ongoing relevance of the Holocaust for the 21st century and beyond.”\nISGAP’s board is a who’s who of Israeli national security state officials. This includes Natan Sharansky, former Minister of Internal Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister of Israel, and Brigadier General Sima Vaknin-Gil, the former Chief Censor for the IDF and Director General of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs and Diplomacy. Also on the board is Jeffrey Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz.\nThe think tank was a key player in the U.S. government’s decision to repress the 2024 Gaza protests on university campuses nationwide. The group produced reports linking student leaders with foreign terrorist organizations and promoted dubious claims about a wave of anti-Semitism washing over American colleges. It met frequently with both Democratic and Republican leaders, and urged them to “investigate” (i.e., repress) the leaders of the demonstrations.\nISGAP has continually warned of foreign influence on American campuses, producing reports and holding seminars detailing Qatar’s supposed stranglehold over the U.S. higher education system, and linking that with growing anti-Israel sentiment among America’s youth.\nYet if ISGAP wished to investigate other foreign government influence operations, it would not have to look far, as its own funds overwhelmingly come from a single source: the Israeli state. In 2018, an investigation found that Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs (then headed by Brigadier General Vaknin-Gil herself) channeled $445,000 to ISGAP, a sum representing nearly 80% of its entire revenues for that year. ISGAP failed to disclose that information to either the public or the federal government.\nAt the height of the concern over foreign interference in American politics, the news barely registered. Since then, the Israeli government has continued to bankroll the group to the tune of millions. In 2019, for example, it approved a grant of over $1.3 million to ISGAP. Thus, in her role as a fellow at the organization, Christine Maxwell is the direct beneficiary of Israeli government cash.\nTHIRD GENERATION MAXWELLS: WORKING IN THE US GOVERNMENT\nWhile Robert Maxwell’s daughters were close to state power, some of the family’s third generation have taken up positions within the U.S. government itself. Shortly after graduating from college, Alex Djerassi (Isabel Maxwell’s only son) was employed by Hillary Clinton on her 2007-2008 presidential campaign. Djerassi drafted memos, briefings, and policy papers for the Clinton team and helped prepare her for more than 20 debates.\nThe Clinton and Maxwell families are closely intertwined. Ghislaine vacationed with Hillary’s daughter, Chelsea, and appeared prominently at her wedding. Both she and Jeffrey Epstein were invited multiple times to the Clinton White House. Long after Epstein was jailed, President Bill Clinton invited Ghislaine to an intimate dinner with him at an exclusive Los Angeles restaurant.\nAlthough she failed in her bid for the White House, President Obama named Hillary Clinton as his Secretary of State, and one of her first actions was to appoint Djerassi to her team. He quickly rose in the ranks, becoming Chief of Staff at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. In this role, he specialized in developing the United States’ policy towards Israel and Iran, although he also worked on the U.S. occupation of Iraq, and accompanied Clinton on visits to Israel and the Arab world.\nWhile at the State Department, he served as the U.S. government representative to the Friends of Libya and the Friends of the Syrian People Conferences. These were two organizations of hardline, hawkish groups working towards the overthrow of those two governments, and their replacement with U.S.-friendly regimes. Washington got what it wanted. In 2011, Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi was overthrown, killed and replaced by Islamist warlords. And last December, longtime Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, fled to Russia and was replaced by the founder of al-Qaeda in Syria, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.\nDjerassi was later appointed an associate at the U.S.-government-funded think tank, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. While there, he again specialized in Middle East policy, his bio noting that he “worked on matters relating to democratization and civil society in the Arab world, the Arab uprisings, and Israeli-Palestinian peace.” Today, he works in Silicon Valley.\nWhile Djerassi’s fortunes were tied to the Clinton faction of the Democratic Party, his cousin Xavier Malina (Christine Maxwell’s eldest son) backed the right horse, working on the Obama-Biden 2008 presidential run.\nHe was rewarded for his good work with a position in the White House itself, where he became a Staff Assistant at the Executive Office of the President. Like his cousin, once his time in office was over, Malina also secured a position at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace before pursuing a career in the tech world, working for many years at Google in the Bay Area. He currently works for Disney.\nWhile the actions of parents and grandparents should not determine the careers of later generations, the fact that two individuals who come from a multi-generational family of unrepentant spies and operatives of a foreign power secured positions at the center of the U.S. State is at least worthy of note.\nTHE MAXWELL BROTHERS: FROM BANKRUPTCY TO COUNTERTERRORISM\nMuch of the Maxwell clan is most influential in American and Israeli politics. However, brothers Ian and Kevin also hold considerable sway over affairs in their native Great Britain. Although being acquitted of charges over widespread allegations that they helped their father, Robert, plunder over $160 million from his employees’ pension fund, the brothers kept a low profile for many years. Kevin, in particular, was known for little more than being Britain’s largest-ever bankrupt, with debts exceeding half a billion dollars.\nHowever, in 2018, they launched Combating Jihadist Terrorism and Extremism (CoJiT), a controversial think tank pushing for a far more invasive and heavy-handed government approach to the question of radical Islam.\nIn his organization’s book, “Jihadist Terror: New Threats, New Responses,” Ian writes that CoJiT was set up to play a “catalyzing role in the national conversation,” and to answer “difficult questions” arising from the issue. Judging by the content of the rest of the book, this means pushing for even more extensive surveillance of Muslim communities.\nWithin Britain, CoJiT was a highly influential organization. Its editorial board and contributors are a who’s who of high state officials. Individuals participating in its inaugural conference in London in 2018 included Sara Khan, the government’s Lead Commissioner for Countering Extremism, and Jonathan Evans, the former Director General of MI5, Britain’s domestic intelligence agency.\nLike so many Maxwell projects, CoJiT appears to have wrapped up its affairs. The organization has not updated its website or posted anything on its social media channels since 2022.\nIn fairness, in the past few years, the brothers have had other priorities, leading the campaign to free their sister Ghislaine from prison, insisting that she is entirely innocent. In a manner reminiscent of Robert Maxwell, however, it appears that Kevin may have failed to pay the defense team; in 2022, Maxwell’s lawyers sued him, seeking unpaid fees of nearly $900,000.\nTHE INFAMOUS MR. EPSTEIN\nFor years, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein ran a sex trafficking ring that exploited hundreds of girls and young women. They were also connected to vast networks of the global elite, including billionaire business owners, royalty, star academics, and foreign leaders, among their closest acquaintances, leading to intense speculation about the extent of their involvement in their many crimes.\nIt is still unclear when Epstein first met with the Maxwells, with some alleging that he was recruited into Israeli intelligence by Robert Maxwell. Others state the relationship only began after Robert’s death, when he saved the family from penury following its financial problems.\nOnly one month after his 2019 arrest, Epstein was found dead in his New York City prison cell. His death was officially ruled a suicide, although his family has rejected this interpretation.\nPerhaps the two most powerful individuals in Epstein’s circle of confidants were Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Clinton, already infamous for the numerous accusations of sexual misconduct against him, is known to have flown at least 17 times on Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express,” and was accused by Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre, of visiting Little St. James Island, the multimillionaire’s private Caribbean residence, where many of his worst crimes took place.\nTrump, arguably, was even closer to the disgraced financier. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” he said in 2002, “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it.” Like Clinton, Trump flew on the Lolita Express. Epstein attended his wedding to Marla Maples in 1993, and claimed to have introduced him to his third wife, Melania.\nUnfortunately, while Epstein’s ties incriminate the entire political spectrum, coverage has often been framed as a partisan issue. A MintPress study of over one year of Epstein coverage on MSNBC and Fox News found that each network downplayed his connections to their preferred president, while emphasizing and highlighting the links to the leader of the other major party. As a result, many in the United States see the affair as an indictment of their political rivals, rather than of the political system as a whole.\nThere also remains the question of Epstein’s links to intelligence, something that has been openly speculated about in the media for decades, even years before any allegations against him were made public. Throughout the 1990s, Epstein’s biographer Julie K. Brown noted, he openly boasted about working for both the CIA and Mossad, although the veracity of his claims remains in doubt. As Britain’s Sunday Times wrote in 2000, “He’s Mr. Enigmatic. Nobody knows whether he’s a concert pianist, property developer, a CIA agent, a math teacher or a member of Mossad.” It is possible that there is at least a grain of truth to all of these identities.\nEpstein met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns three times in 2014. Burns would later be named director of the CIA. Burns’ proximity to Epstein, however, pales in comparison to that of former Israeli Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Between 2013 and 2017 alone, Barak is known to have traveled to New York City and met with the convicted criminal at least 30 times, sometimes arriving at his Manhattan mansion incognito or wearing a mask to hide his identity.\nNumerous sources have commented on Epstein’s connections to Israeli intelligence. A previous girlfriend and victim of his, referred in court documents as Jane Doe 200 to hide her identity, testified that Epstein boasted about being a Mossad operative and that, after he raped her, she could not go to the police because his position as a spy made her fear for her life.\n“Doe genuinely believed that any reporting of the rape by what she believed to be a Mossad agent with some of the most unique connections in the world would result in significant bodily harm or death to her,” reads the court filing.\nAri Ben-Menashe, a former senior official in Israel’s Military Intelligence Directorate, claimed that Epstein was a spy and that he and Ghislaine Maxwell were running a honeytrap operation on behalf of Israel. Four (anonymous) sources told Rolling Stone that Epstein had directly worked with the Israeli government.\nUnlike much of the Maxwell family, however, his Israel and intelligence connections are based largely on testimony and unverified accounts. His only known trip to the country was in April 2008, just before his sentencing, a move that sparked fears he would seek refuge there.\nNevertheless, there has been intense public speculation that he could have been working for Tel Aviv. At the Turning Points USA Student Action Summit 2025, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson stated that there is nothing wrong, hateful or anti-Semitic about asking questions about Epstein’s foreign connections. “No one’s allowed to say that the foreign government is Israel, because we’ve been somehow cowed into thinking that that’s naughty,” he said, before expressing his exasperation about the media’s silence on the issue.\nWhat the hell is this? You have the former Israeli prime minister living in your house, you have had all this contact with a foreign government, were you working on behalf of the Mossad? Were you running a blackmail operation on behalf of a foreign government?”\nCarlson’s comments drew harsh condemnation from former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. “The accusation that Jeffrey Epstein somehow worked for Israel or the Mossad running a blackmail ring is categorically and totally false. Epstein’s conduct, both the criminal and the merely despicable, had nothing whatsoever to do with the Mossad or the State of Israel,” he wrote.\n“This accusation is a lie being peddled by prominent online personalities such as Tucker Carlson pretending they know things they don’t,” he added, concluding that Israel was under attack from a “vicious wave of slander and lies.”\nWhatever the truth about Epstein, it is indisputable that the powerful Maxwell family holds wide-ranging connections to U.S., British and Israeli state power. It is also beyond doubt that if the full story of their activities were ever to reach the public, it would incriminate a significant number of the world’s most powerful people and organizations. Perhaps that is why Trump has, in short order, gone from promising to release the Epstein Files to potentially releasing his accomplice.\nRead the full article at MintPress News.\nComment on this article at HealthImpactNews.com.\nThis article was written by Human Superior Intelligence (HSI)\nSee Also:\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\nWho Controls the Weather?

      "text": "#Ghislaine Maxwell# Jeffrey Epstein# Trump# Bill Clinton# Epstein Files# DOJ transcript# Epstein death# cover-up allegations\nIBNS-CMEDIA: The Justice Department on Friday released the transcript of a weeks-old interview with convicted deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\nIt marked one of two steps by the White House to quell backlash over its handling of the Epstein files—a controversy that has unsettled even President Donald Trump’s supporters, CNN reported.\nThe other step, a push to unseal grand jury testimony, has been described by judges as a diversionary tactic with little substance.\nEpstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. He died by hanging in his jail cell on August 10, 2019.\nMaxwell denies wrongdoing, casts doubt on crimes\nIn her interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Maxwell did not implicate anyone in misconduct and insisted Epstein had no client list.\nShe denied recruiting women for Epstein, denied witnessing sexual abuse, and even suggested she never saw “any man” behave inappropriately.\n“I never, ever saw any man doing something inappropriate with a woman of any age,” she said.\nShe also dismissed claims about hidden surveillance cameras in Epstein’s properties, despite reports and victims’ accounts suggesting otherwise.\nOn recruiting Virginia Giuffre from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Maxwell first denied the claim, then softened her answer: “I don’t remember anybody that I would have [recruited]. But it’s not impossible that I might have asked someone from there.”\nDisputes Epstein’s cause of death\nMaxwell questioned the official finding that Epstein died by suicide. “I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she said, while rejecting theories that he was killed over blackmail material.\nInstead, she suggested a more ordinary explanation: “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary.”\nHer comments are likely to fuel further speculation, especially as polls show a majority of Americans believe the government is hiding information about Epstein’s death.\nPraise for Trump amid legal troubles\nMaxwell, whose lawyer has hinted at hopes for a pardon or intervention, took time to praise Trump.\n“I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now. And I like him, and I’ve always liked him,” she said.\nShe has recently been moved to a lower-security prison camp—an unusual transfer that the administration has not explained.\nBlanche reminded her she had limited immunity for the interview but added, “I’m not promising to do anything” for her.\nWell-known names surface in transcript\nContrary to earlier promises not to mention uncharged individuals, the transcript included references to Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Harvey Weinstein, among others.\nMaxwell denied seeing any misconduct by them. She stressed that Clinton “absolutely never went” to Epstein’s island, directly contradicting Trump’s repeated claims that Clinton had visited it dozens of times.\n“He never [did],” she said. “Absolutely never went. And I can be sure of that because… I don’t believe there’s any way he would’ve gone to the island had I not been there.”\nYet Maxwell’s denials are overshadowed by her own conviction for conspiring with Epstein, raising doubts over the credibility of her testimony."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the revelations about Trump, Clinton, Epstein, and her father\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has released hours of interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell , the only person convicted for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, as an assistant in the provision of paid sexual favors, including from minors.\nDuring the interviews, held at a federal penitentiary in Florida, Maxwell offered his version of events regarding some of the most controversial figures connected to the case, including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Epstein himself, and his father, the tycoon Robert Maxwell. His statements, released under limited immunity, add new insights into a complex and still fraught affair.\nDonald Trump: \"I've never seen anything inappropriate.\"\nWhen asked about Donald Trump, Ghislaine Maxwell firmly denied ever witnessing any inappropriate behavior from the former president. When asked directly by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche whether she had ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump had done anything inappropriate, she replied, \"Absolutely never, in any context.\" She then added, \"I have never seen the President in any inappropriate context, in any way.\" Her words appear to exonerate Trump from any direct involvement in the illicit activities of his world.\nTodd Blanche: Did you ever hear Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had done anything inappropriate with masses or with anybody in your world?\nGhislaine Maxwell: Absolutely never. In any context. pic.twitter.com/8rq2KQm2or\n— Bad Hombre (@joma_gc) August 22, 2025\nThe Clintons, “Friends of Me, Not Epstein’s”\nOne of Maxwell's most outspoken statements concerns the Clintons. She claimed that Bill and Hillary Clinton were her friends, not Jeffrey Epstein's, debunking rumors of a close relationship between the former president and the financier. She categorically denied that Bill Clinton ever visited Epstein's infamous island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, she admitted to direct involvement with the couple, revealing that she was \" part of the initial process of the Clinton Global Initiative,\" a detail that confirms her closeness to that sphere of influence.\nGhislaine Maxwell: \"I was part of the beginning process of the Clinton Global Initiative.\" pic.twitter.com/wbLLWeOxPY\n— Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber) August 22, 2025\nThe portrait of Jeffrey Epstein\nWhile distancing himself from Epstein, Maxwell painted a complex portrait of Jeffrey Epstein. \" I believe Epstein did a lot, not all, but some of what he's accused of, and I'm not here to defend him ,\" he said. He called him \"a disgusting man who did terrible things to young children,\" while simultaneously downplaying his role. According to Maxwell, Epstein was not the mastermind of a large-scale blackmail operation and did not possess a \"client list\" or compromising material. He also attributed a change in his character to his use of testosterone , which began in the late 1990s. Regarding his death, Maxwell reiterated that he does not believe it was suicide, as claimed in all official versions, including those of the FBI.\nFather Robert Maxwell and the Secret Service\nPerhaps the most surprising revelation concerns her father, media mogul Robert Maxwell. Ghislaine confirmed decades-old speculation that her father was an \"intelligence asset.\" This admission lends weight to theories that Robert Maxwell was a covert agent, possibly for the Israeli Mossad. Despite this connection, Ghislaine clarified that her father and Jeffrey Epstein never met.\nMUST LISTEN\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche asks Ghislaine Maxwell about her father working for “any” foreign intelligence agency.\nLISTEN TO HER RESPONSE: pic.twitter.com/Kwv1BFuUfo\n— Breanna Morello (@BreannaMorello) August 22, 2025\nThe case of Prince Andrew and the \"fake\" photo\nMaxwell also spoke about Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom, denying ever having seen him act inappropriately. Regarding the famous photograph of the prince with Virginia Giuffre, then a minor, and Maxwell herself in the background, she said: \"I think it's literally a fake photo.\" She also denied having introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein.\nSo I scanned a few pages of the first excerpt and Maxwell appears to be suggesting Prince Andrew is innocent and the widely-publicized photo of him with Virginia Guiffre is a \"fake photo.\" So we can conclude that all these interviews are just plain bullshit. and Ghislane is…\n— MAGA Ascending (@Maganificent77) August 22, 2025\nGhislaine Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding Epstein in the trafficking of underage girls, but she was recently transferred to a minimum-security prison, where she enjoys relatively good treatment.\nHis statements, despite coming from a directly involved source, offer a new perspective on one of the murkiest affairs of recent decades, raising further questions about the links between power, finance, and the secret services.\nThe article Ghislaine Maxwell, the revelations about Trump, Clinton, Epstein and her father comes from Scenari Economici .\nThis is a machine translation of a post published on Scenari Economici at the URL https://scenarieconomici.it/ghislaine-maxwell-le-rivelazioni-su-trump-clinton-epstein-e-suo-padre/ on Sat, 23 Aug 2025 10:00:11 +0000."

      "text": "Key takeaways:\n- In the Ghislaine Maxwell interview, Maxwell referenced Trump 22 times.\n- She said she could not recall many details due to her jail time.\n- Maxwell denied Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide and blamed prison violence.\n- She praised Trump as a gentleman and admired his rise to the presidency.\n- Maxwell described Epstein’s leather-bound birthday book but forgot many specifics.\n- She recalled meeting Elon Musk at a private event for Sergey Brin.\nHighlights from the Ghislaine Maxwell Interview\nThe Justice Department released a two-day transcript of Ghislaine Maxwell’s interview. In the Ghislaine Maxwell interview, she faced questions about Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump and more. The transcript reveals she mentioned Trump 22 times. Here are five standout quotes and moments.\nMaxwell’s Memory Lapses\nFirst, Maxwell often replied, “I don’t recall.” When asked if Mar-a-Lago spa staff gave private massages to Epstein, she paused and said her memory failed. She explained she spent almost two years in solitary confinement in Brooklyn. Guards woke her every 15 minutes. Therefore, she said, her memory suffered greatly. Despite this, she admitted some events might have happened. Yet, she could not confirm any specifics about the spa or related claims.\nDoubts Over Epstein’s Death\nNext, Maxwell spoke about Epstein’s final hours. She declared she does not believe he died by suicide. Agents then asked if she suspected anyone of killing him. She offered no names. Instead, she described prison dangers. Maxwell explained that prisoners could kill or hire other inmates for $25 of commissary credit. She claimed that was the going rate for a hit. This shocking detail fueled her doubts about the official story of Epstein’s death.\nUnexpected Praise for Trump\nAlso, Maxwell shared warm words about Donald Trump. In the Ghislaine Maxwell interview, she said her father liked Trump and his wife. She added they shared Czechoslovakian roots. Maxwell said Trump treated her with kindness at social events. She admired his achievement in becoming president. She even called him a gentleman. “He was never inappropriate,” she told agents. When asked whether she saw any misconduct, Maxwell replied she never witnessed such behavior.\nThe Elusive Birthday Book\nMaxwell discussed Epstein’s famed birthday book. She recalled its leather binding and large size—over a foot tall. Agents asked if she wrote a letter for it. She could not remember clearly. She guessed someone else might have handled the invitations. Maxwell placed the book behind Epstein’s desk on 71st Street. She noted prosecutors had some pages, but Trump’s letter wasn’t among them. She said few letters survived the discovery phase. She even forgot if the book included a nude drawing.\nMeeting Elon Musk\nMeanwhile, Maxwell described meeting Elon Musk. She said they met around 2010 or 2011 at a birthday party for Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Epstein did not attend. Maxwell and a small group spent three or four days on a friend’s private island. She guessed there were roughly 30 to 50 guests. She also remembered spotting Musk at the Oscars. Agents mentioned emails between Musk and Epstein. Maxwell said she saw those emails in the case records, but she could not confirm their content personally.\nNo Client List Found\nFinally, Maxwell addressed the rumor of a so-called client list. She flatly denied the existence of any “black book.” She traced the story back to 2009 civil suits. A lawyer allegedly received notes from a former Epstein butler. That butler later faced unrelated gun charges. Maxwell said civil attorneys then misreported the notes as a detailed list. She insisted no formal client list ever existed. She blamed leaks and misinterpretations for the persistent myth.\nWhy the Ghislaine Maxwell Interview Matters\nThis transcript offers a rare window into Maxwell’s perspective. In the Ghislaine Maxwell interview, she distances Trump from Epstein’s crimes while challenging official narratives. She claims her memory suffered in jail, rejects the suicide story, and dismisses the idea of a client list. Her praise of Trump stands out against the other heated topics.\nHer answers show how she manages what she recalls and what she denies. As Maxwell’s case continues, these quotes may play key roles in her defense. Overall, the Ghislaine Maxwell interview provides fresh insight into her version of events and her ties to powerful figures.\nFAQs\nWhat did Maxwell say about Trump?\nShe called Trump cordial, kind and a gentleman. She admired his rise to the presidency and said she never saw misconduct.\nDid Maxwell believe Epstein killed himself?\nNo. Maxwell said she doubts he died by suicide. She pointed to prison violence and inmate hits as possible causes.\nWhat is Epstein’s birthday book?\nIt’s a large, leather-bound volume of birthday greetings. Maxwell recalled its size and cover but forgot many details.\nDid Maxwell confirm a client list?\nNo. Maxwell denied any list existed. She traced the rumor to a 2009 civil lawyer’s notes and called it a myth."

      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell has denied one of the biggest claims linked to the Jeffrey Epstein case. She says a so-called “client list” of powerful people simply does not exist.\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein traffic underage girls. She gave this statement in July during a long interview with US officials. The transcript, released this week, runs over 300 pages.\nIn the interview, Maxwell was asked about Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. She said she never saw either man act inappropriately. She described Trump as “a gentleman” and said he was never part of Epstein’s massage sessions, which many victims have mentioned.\nShe also denied a claim that Trump sent Epstein a birthday note in 2003. Reports about the note appeared earlier this year, but Maxwell said she did not recall it.\nMaxwell strongly defended Britain’s Prince Andrew. She called allegations that he had sex with an underage girl in her London home “mind-blowingly not conceivable.”\nShe denied that she introduced Andrew to Epstein, saying that his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, may have been the link. Representatives for Ferguson refused to comment.\nShe also said the famous photo showing Andrew with Virginia Giuffre, while Maxwell stands in the background, was fake. Andrew himself has also questioned the photo’s authenticity.\nGiuffre accused Andrew of abusing her at age 17. Andrew denied the claim but reached a financial settlement with her in 2022. Giuffre died earlier this year. Her family has called Maxwell a “monster” and said her testimony should not be trusted.\nMaxwell was asked about many well-known names. These included Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Kevin Spacey, Naomi Campbell, Robert F Kennedy Jr, and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.\nFor years, conspiracy theories claimed there was a secret “client list” of celebrities and politicians who abused girls through Epstein’s network. Maxwell said this was false. “There is no list,” she told investigators.\nMaxwell explained that she first became close to Epstein in 1991. She said they had a sexual relationship that later turned into a business arrangement. Even after their relationship ended, Epstein continued to pay her. By 2009, she received up to $250,000 a year.\nShe described their bond as “friends with benefits.” But she said their contact was almost non-existent between 2010 and Epstein’s death in 2019.\nEpstein died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. Officials ruled his death a suicide.\nMaxwell said she does not believe he killed himself. She also said she does not believe he was murdered. According to her, if anyone had wanted him dead, they could have done it before he was in jail.\nMaxwell has appealed her conviction. She has also asked the US Supreme Court to overturn it. Her lawyers say they would welcome a presidential pardon.\nThe White House has insisted that no leniency is being considered in her case. Shortly after her interview, Maxwell was moved from a prison in Florida to a lower-security facility in Texas. The reason for the transfer was not given.\nWe welcome your contributions!

The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.\nThe transcript release represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump’s base as they send Congress evidence they had previously kept from view.\nAfter her interview with Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas.\n(0) comments\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nKeep it Clean.

The Role of Media and Public Perception\n- 15. Benefits of Increased Transparency\nThe Trump administration released hundreds of pages of transcripts from an interview conducted last month with Maxwell by deputy Prosecutor Todd Blanche. this action followed criticism for the administration’s initial reluctance to disclose documents pertaining to the epstein sex trafficking case,as reports indicate the administration aimed to demonstrate clarity.\nAccording to the transcripts, Maxwell repeatedly praised the former president and firmly denied observing any instances of inappropriate conduct on his part. The release of these denials arrives as President Trump frequently faces questions about his decades-long friendship with epstein, and his administration contends with intense oversight of its handling of evidence within the case.\nMaxwell’s Testimony: A Defense of Trump\nOfficials seemingly hoped that releasing Maxwell’s statements would quell the ongoing discontent among Trump’s supporters, while simultaneously providing Congress with the evidence they had previously withheld. Maxwell’s testimony represents a strategic effort to manage the political fallout from the Epstein case.\nFollowing her interview with Blanche, maxwell was transferred from a Federal safety Prison in Florida to a minimum-security detention camp in Texas to serve her 20-year sentence.She was convicted in 2021 for facilitating Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls. the trial included harrowing accounts from four women who testified they were sexually assaulted by Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s at his residence, with Maxwell playing a central role in their exploitation.\nMaxwell’s legal team has maintained her innocence,with attorney David Oscar Marcus stating on social media that she “never shoudl have been tried,let alone convicted.”\n“Never Inappropriate,” Maxwell Claims\n“In fact, I have never seen the president in any massage context,” Maxwell stated in the transcripts. “I have never seen the president in an inappropriate context, in any way. The president has never been inappropriate with anyone. During my meetings with him,he was a gentleman in all respects.”\nMaxwell recalled first becoming acquainted with Donald Trump around 1990, when her father, media mogul Robert Maxwell, owned the New York Daily News. She described frequent visits to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, occasionally alone, but stated she had not seen him as the mid-2000s. When questioned about rumors of Trump’s involvement in inappropriate acts with masseuses or others, Maxwell unequivocally responded: “Absolutely never, in any context.”\nConnections to High-Profile Individuals\nMaxwell, who received limited immunity allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for her statements (excluding perjury), was questioned by the prosecutor for two days last month. This immunity was a key aspect of securing her testimony, encouraging a more open discussion of sensitive matters.\nThe Epstein case has garnered widespread attention, largely due to the financier’s extensive network of connections, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Trump has asserted that he severed ties with epstein years prior to the investigations.\nMaxwell stated that Bill Clinton was initially a friend of her father’s, not Epstein’s, and that she never witnessed him receiving a massage. She testified that she and Clinton traveled together on Epstein’s plane approximately two dozen times.\nShe also offered a positive portrayal of Prince Andrew, dismissing claims made by virginia Giuffre as “absurd.”\n“this is the only time when,from my personal perspective,President Clinton could have been massaged,” Maxwell added,”and he didn’t as I was there.”\nMaxwell attempted to distance herself from Epstein’s actions, consistently denying allegations regarding her role in his abuse. While acknowledging that Epstein later favored younger women, she maintained that she never believed this involved minors.\n“I saw, from my meeting, that he was in relation, or rather in relation, or friend, no matter how we qualify him, with women in their twenties,” she told Blanche. “And then he slipped towards women of younger appearance. But I had never considered that it could involve criminal behavior.”\nEpstein was arrested in 2019 on sex trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing numerous teenagers, and was found dead in a New York prison cell a month later, ruled a suicide by investigators.\nUnderstanding the Epstein case: A Timeline\n| Year | Event |\n|---|---|\n| 1990s – early 2000s | Alleged abuse of teenage girls by Jeffrey Epstein. |\n| 2019 | Epstein arrested on sex trafficking charges. |\n| August 2019 | Epstein found dead in prison. |\n| 2021 | Ghislaine Maxwell convicted of sex trafficking. |\n| 2025 | Release of transcripts from Maxwell’s interview. |\nDid You Know?

These statements, surfacing through legal filings and reported by various news outlets, come amidst ongoing scrutiny of the case and persistent questions about the extent of Trump's association with Epstein. The core of the issue revolves around verifying claims made in court documents and media reports concerning Trump's interactions with epstein and Maxwell.\nKey Claims and Denials: A Timeline\nMaxwell's denials aren't new, but they've been consistently reinforced as further details from the Epstein case emerge. Hear's a breakdown of key points:\nVirginia Giuffre's Allegations: Central to the controversy are allegations made by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sexual encounters with numerous powerful figures, including Donald Trump. Maxwell has consistently denied facilitating any such encounters.\nFlight Logs & Travel Records: Scrutiny of flight logs for Epstein's private jet, often referred to as the \"Lolita Express,\" has revealed Trump's name as a passenger on at least one occasion. Maxwell maintains she had no control over the passenger manifests and was unaware of who was traveling on the plane.\nMaxwell's Testimony: During her trial, Maxwell testified that her relationship with Trump was primarily social and that she never witnessed any inappropriate behavior. She characterized their interactions as limited and superficial.\nRecent Legal Filings (August 2025): Recent filings related to ongoing civil lawsuits have included renewed assertions from Maxwell's legal team denying any knowledge of Trump's involvement in criminal activity related to Epstein. These filings specifically address claims of conspiracy and facilitation of sex trafficking.\nExamining the Evidence: What Do the Records Show?\nThe available evidence presents a complex picture. While Trump's presence on Epstein's flight logs is documented, the context of those flights remains a point of contention.\nFlight Log Analysis: Records indicate Trump flew on Epstein's jet in 1997. trump has stated the flight was for a business trip and that he barely knew Epstein.\nPhotographic Evidence: A photograph of Trump,Epstein,and Maxwell together has circulated widely. Maxwell has acknowledged the photo but claims it doesn't indicate any illicit activity.\nWitness Testimony: Beyond Giuffre's allegations, other witnesses have provided varying accounts of Trump's interactions with epstein and Maxwell. These testimonies are frequently enough conflicting and subject to scrutiny regarding credibility.\nThe Sealed Doe Documents: The release of redacted documents from the Doe lawsuit against Epstein has fueled further speculation. While many details remain sealed, the documents contain references to individuals associated with Trump, prompting calls for full openness.\nThe Legal Ramifications & Ongoing Lawsuits\nthe Epstein case continues to generate significant legal fallout. Several lawsuits are ongoing,seeking to hold individuals and institutions accountable for their alleged roles in the trafficking network.\nGiuffre v.Trump: Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit against Donald Trump alleging defamation remains a key legal battle. Trump has vehemently denied the allegations and filed a countersuit.\nCivil Claims Against Maxwell: Numerous civil claims have been filed against Maxwell, seeking damages for the harm caused by Epstein's crimes.\nDepartment of Justice investigations: The Department of Justice continues to investigate potential co-conspirators in the Epstein case, although the scope and focus of these investigations remain largely confidential.\nImpact on Trump's Political Future: The allegations surrounding Trump's association with Epstein have consistently shadowed his political career, raising questions about his judgment and character.\nUnderstanding the Key Players: Epstein, Maxwell, and Trump\nTo fully grasp the complexities of this case, it's crucial to understand the roles of the central figures:\nJeffrey Epstein: The central perpetrator of the sex trafficking crimes, Epstein used his wealth and influence to exploit and abuse young women.\nGhislaine Maxwell: Epstein's longtime associate and alleged recruiter,Maxwell played a key role in facilitating his crimes. She was convicted on multiple counts of sex trafficking and conspiracy.\nDonald Trump: Former president of the United States, Trump's association with Epstein has been the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy. He maintains he had limited contact with Epstein and was unaware of his criminal activities.\nThe Role of Media and Public Perception\nThe media has played a significant role in shaping public perception of the Epstein case and the Trump connection. Sensationalized reporting and the spread of misinformation have contributed to a highly polarized debate. Fact-checking and critical analysis of information are essential for navigating the complexities of this case.the use of keywords like \"Epstein network,\" \"sex trafficking allegations,\" and \"Trump-Epstein ties\" are prevalent in media coverage.\nBenefits of Increased Transparency\nGreater transparency in the Epstein case - including the full release of sealed documents - could offer several benefits:\nAccountability: Holding all individuals involved accountable for their actions.\nJustice for Victims: Providing closure and justice for the victims of Epstein's crimes.\nPreventing Future Abuse: Identifying systemic failures that allowed the trafficking network to operate and implementing measures to prevent similar"

      "text": "DOJ releases transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell interview – National & International News\nGhislaine Maxwell’s hours-long interviews reveal more about her complicated relationship with Epstein than about any criminal activity.\nDOJ releases transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell interview\nThe Department of Justice has released written transcripts and audio recordings from two days of interviews with Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The interview between Maxwell and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche took place last month at the low security prison in Tallahassee, FL, where she was serving her 20-year sentence. Maxwell, who was convicted on sex trafficking charges in 2022, has since been moved to a minimum security prison camp in Texas, which has stirred much controversy.\nThe transcripts run to hundreds of pages in total and news outlets examining them have so far not unearthed any major bombshells. More than anything, the text reveals Maxwell’s unreliability as a witness and her desire to minimize her knowledge of or involvement in any criminality. When asked direct questions matters that might incriminate herself, Epstein or others, Maxwell often pleads her faulty memory (which she says resulted from a lengthy stretch in solitary confinement). However, she is quite definitive in asserting that she never witnessed any inappropriate or abusive behavior by Epstein or any of his associates towards any of the young women and girls in Epstein’s orbit. Maxwell is still appealing her conviction and any such admissions would be detrimental to that. She does admit that “somebody’s [idea of ] inappropriate and mine may be different”.\nMaxwell also proclaims that there was no “client list” and rejects any notion that Epstein was blackmailing anyone over their misdeeds with young women or girls. She also claimed that Epstein did not have cameras mounted in his various homes to record his guests. However, the New York Times recently revealed there were cameras throughout Epstein’s 7-floor Manhattan townhouse.\nPrince Andrew, the Clintons, Trump and “Bobby” Kennedy\nDespite her memory issues, Maxwell offers clear, often vivid accounts of her relationships with famous figures, including the Clintons, Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and others. Maxwell considered the former Duchess of York a rival for Epstein’s affections. She also portrays herself as having a closer relationship to Bill Clinton than Epstein did. She even claims to have been “central” in helping the Clintons set up the Clinton Global Initiative, though she believes Epstein later tried to “insert himself” into that project.\nMaxwell was also quite lucid in explaining away her presence in the infamous photo of Prince Andrew and Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in a way which completely exonerates her, while also claiming the photo is fake. Maxwell also lays much of the blame for the trafficking of minors on Giuffre herself. Giuffre’s name and the names of other accusers are redacted, but it is clear who she is speaking about from context.\nWhen asked about Trump’s well-documented relationship with Epstein, Maxwell sought to minimize it, and emphasize that Trump was “a gentleman in all respects”. She also went out of her way to flatter Trump and praise his political success. She also said she and Epstein went on a dinosaur-bone hunting trip with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and that she never witnessed any inappropriate behavior on his part.\nMoney transfers and Epstein’s business dealings\nMaxwell was most evasive when asked about over $30 million which Epstein transferred to her accounts in the latter years of their relationship. Prosecutors have alleged that this was payment for Maxwell’s services in helping Epstein to procure young women. Maxwell at times claimed not to remember having received these funds. At other times, she said Epstein might have given her the funds to support her in various entrepreneurial ventures.\nIn general, Epstein’s shadowy financial dealings have gone largely unscrutinized both by the press and the public. This is despite an ample paper trail, some of which has become public through court proceedings, but much of which remains under wraps. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) recently demanded government transparency on over $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions by Epstein, which Wyden said is indicative of money laundering. Some have even alleged that Epstein helped Maxwell’s media mogul father Robert Maxwell hide £800 million in funds that Mr. Maxwell embezzled from his companies’ pension funds shortly before his mysterious drowning death in 1991. That would be over $2.5 billion in 2025 terms.\nGhislaine denies any business connection between Epstein and her father prior to the latter’s death. In her interview, she denies having “sophisticated” knowledge of Epstein’s business dealings, which she claims Epstein did not share with her. However, she also implies that she herself sometimes gave Epstein investment tips and helped Epstein forge relationships with wealthy people in her social circles in London and New York.\nMaxwell does not believe Epstein killed himself\nWhen Blanche asked Maxwell whether she believed Epstein killed himself, Maxwell’s attorney David Markus interjected and asked for a break before she could answer. After a break of less than 20 minutes, they did not immediately return to the topic. When they did, Maxwell said that she does not believe Epstein died by suicide. However, she did not lay the blame on any conspiracy by Epstein’s associates who might have feared he would incriminate them. She called the idea “ludicrous,” reasoning that “if that is what they wanted, they would’ve had plenty of opportunity when he wasn’t in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would’ve been a very easy target”.\nMaxwell instead blamed the “the mismanagement and inefficiencies and total dereliction of duty at the Bureau of Prisons”. She theorized that Epstein might have been killed in a jailhouse hit ordered by a fellow inmate for unknown reasons. “In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary,” Maxwell said. “That’s about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”\nInterview reveals Maxwell’s complicated relationship with Epstein\nMaxwell had a close association with Epstein for over 15 years, and if there were any revelations in this interview, they were of her complicated feelings about their relationship. Throughout the interview, Maxwell refers to her old partner-in-crime only as “Epstein” rather than by his given name. She claims the pair only slept together once and implies that she regarded the relationship as being more serious than he did. Maxwell also repeatedly expressed a dislike of the word “relationship”, whether between herself and Epstein or Epstein and anyone else. She instead declares she was more of an employee where Epstein was concerned.\nFollowing the death of her father, Maxwell acknowledges became financially and emotionally dependent on Epstein, who she said was always “generous” with her. “But he kept a lot to himself and he didn’t like to share. He was not a sharer,” she said, “Well, at least not with me”. Whether that’s true or simply meant to distance herself from his crimes is difficult to say. Though she claims never to have witnessed any impropriety herself, Maxwell says she does believe that Epstein did commit “some” of the sexual misdeeds he is accused of.\nWhile acknowledging Epstein’s generosity towards her, Maxwell also seeks to portray herself as another Epstein “victim”, a grace she does not typically extend to his (and her) actual victims. She implies throughout that Epstein liked to keep her in his shadow and financially dependent on him. In her account, this dynamic continued even after she had distanced herself from him. However, she said she was “hoping for him to be more helpful” when Virginia Giuffre sued her for defamation after Maxwell called Giuffre’s accusations “obvious lies”. It was that lawsuit in 2015 that ultimately led to criminal charges against both Epstein and Maxwell."

      "text": "The Justice Department has released extensive interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, shedding light on her perspectives regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case.\nAccording to Fox News, the interviews, featuring claims and denials from Maxwell, are now available as transcripts and audio files on the department's website.\nConducted by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at the federal prison in Tallahassee, these conversations delve into Maxwell's viewpoint on her involvement in Epstein's illegal activities. Despite her 2021 conviction for aiding Epstein's actions, she firmly denied any involvement in trafficking or witnessing nonconsensual sexual acts. Furthermore, she challenged the existence of a supposed \"client list\" linked to Epstein's crimes.\nIn the hours-long discussions, Maxwell consistently refuted allegations connecting her to trafficking or misconduct with well-known figures. She mentioned specific high-profile individuals, stating she hadn't observed inappropriate behavior from them. Among others, she insisted that she never saw former President Donald Trump or Prince Andrew engage in any such acts.\nMaxwell's stance on former President Bill Clinton also drew attention. She claimed he never visited Epstein's infamous island and expressed the opinion that the Clintons were friends. In her perspective, many claims surrounding Epstein, whom she described as a vile man, are exaggerated.\nMaxwell further contended that the notion of Epstein holding blackmail materials over associates was unfounded. She attributed the origin of this myth to a 2009 incident involving a sting operation and Epstein's former butler.\nDuring the interviews, Maxwell was granted limited immunity from the Justice Department on condition of honesty. She stressed that Epstein was neither as influential nor complex as portrayed.\nMaxwell said, \"This is one man. He's not some – they've made him into this. He's not that interesting. He's a disgusting guy who did terrible things to young kids.\" She went on to express belief in some accusations against Epstein but maintained a distance from them.\nMaxwell's interviews also touched on her relationship with Epstein, revealing personal anecdotes from their time together in the 1990s. She mentioned that their romantic involvement concluded in 1999, and she spoke of changes in Epstein's behavior as he began using testosterone and traveling with \"masseuses.\"\nMaxwell called into question the legitimacy of a photo featuring Prince Andrew, declaring it to be fraudulent. She denied being the one to introduce the Prince to Epstein, contrasting claims made by Virginia Giuffre, whose accusations brought significant attention to Prince Andrew. Tragically, Giuffre is reported to have died by suicide this year.\nDavid Oscar Markus, Maxwell’s attorney, strongly supports her innocence and claims she was wrongfully convicted. Emphasizing their stance, he criticized the Justice Department for seeking a figure to blame amidst public pressure.\nEpstein's death in 2019 remains another point of skepticism for Maxwell. She has conveyed doubts about his suicide ruling, attributing it instead to a heart condition he allegedly had.\nIn recent judicial developments, federal judges decided against unsealing grand jury materials from both Maxwell and Epstein's cases. The release of Maxwell's interviews comes in the wake of this decision, providing an alternate pathway to uncover details related to the high-profile case.\nThese detailed interviews offer insight into Maxwell's interpretations of events surrounding Epstein. The standpoints she took in the interviews continue to challenge public perception and legal interpretations.\nIn summary, the interviews with Maxwell highlight her denials and accusations regarding Epstein's actions and her association with him. Key elements of the interviews stress her claims about high-profile figures and dispute popular allegations. The conversation release contributes a new layer to the Epstein saga, inviting further scrutiny and debate."

      "text": "The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend and accomplice, as the Trump administration scrambles to blunt mounting criticism over its handling of the sex-trafficking case.\nThe disclosure comes after weeks of turmoil inside the administration, fueled by frustration among President Donald Trump’s supporters who had expected sweeping revelations about Epstein’s connections to powerful figures. Instead, officials had repeatedly delayed or refused to release records they previously suggested existed, sparking outrage from conspiracy theorists and right-wing influencers who accused the government of orchestrating a cover-up.\nThe transcripts document two days of interviews conducted last month in Florida by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls, described her earliest recollections of Trump in the 1990s, when her father, British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell, was friendly with the New York real estate mogul.\n“I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said. She added that her father admired Trump’s then-wife, Ivana, because they shared roots in Czechoslovakia.\nAdministration divisions and shifting narratives\nAfter the interviews, Maxwell was quietly transferred from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security camp in Texas. Officials offered no explanation for the move.\nThe release of the transcripts marks a sharp reversal for Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Justice Department, which only weeks earlier had said no further disclosures from the Epstein investigation were “appropriate or warranted.” That announcement — combined with Bondi’s earlier claims that she had a “client list” from Epstein’s files — ignited fury among Trump’s base.\nThe episode has also deepened rifts inside the administration. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, along with co-deputy director Dan Bongino, have faced criticism for raising expectations about dramatic disclosures. Both Patel and Bongino, before joining government, had publicly speculated that Epstein’s “black book” and other records were under FBI control.\nIn February, the White House invited far-right influencers and distributed binders labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” that contained mostly public documents, a move widely derided as a political stunt. Bondi later said a “truckload” of new evidence was under review — only to reverse course when the DOJ concluded most of it was sealed to protect victims.\nTrump seeks to move on\nThe president has since tried to shut down the controversy. At a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump dismissed questions about Epstein as “a hoax” and criticized supporters he said were duped by conspiracy theories.\nStill, the administration’s uneven handling of the case underscores the political risks of overpromising disclosures on a matter that has long fueled suspicion and speculation.\nEpstein, who was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, was found dead a month later in a New York jail in what officials ruled a suicide. His connections to Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew continue to cast a shadow over the case — one the administration has struggled to navigate."

      "bias": "unknown",
      "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell provided no incriminating information during meetings with deputy AG on high-profile individuals who interacted with Jeffrey Epstein: Sources\n(NEW YORK) -- The woman thought to have the most direct knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long sex-trafficking operation claims there was no client list, no blackmail scheme and -- to her knowledge -- no high-profile Epstein associates who committed illicit acts in connection with the notorious sex-offender's crimes.\nThat's according to an account provided by Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to a top official of the U.S. Department of Justice during a highly unusual two-day interview session last month, sources briefed on the contents of the discussions told ABC News.\nMaxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that during her time with Epstein -- which ranged from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s -- she never witnessed nor heard of any inappropriate or criminal activity by President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, nor any of the well-known men who associated with Epstein, according to the sources.\nA transcript of Maxwell's interview with Blanche, and audio of the interview, were among the items provided by the DOJ on Friday to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, in response to a congressional subpoena for the complete investigative files on Epstein, sources said.\nThe 63-year old Maxwell, who has been incarcerated since her arrest in 2020, also claimed she had been misidentified by a key witness at her criminal trial and insisted she was not involved in the sexual exploitation of minors, the sources said.\nBlanche -- who previously served as a personal defense attorney to President Donald Trump -- announced his intention to speak with Maxwell in a social media post last month, as the Trump administration sought to quell the self-inflicted controversy surrounding its decision not to release the government's investigative files on Epstein, after repeatedly promising to do so.\nThe Department of Justice -- in an unsigned memo released last month explaining its decision -- said that a \"systematic review\" revealed no incriminating client list and no evidence \"that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties.\"\nMaxwell was granted limited immunity for the interview with Blanche, sources previously told ABC News, meaning nothing she said could be used against her, unless she lied.\nShe is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding and participating in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls, which involved a scheme to recruit young women and girls for massages of Epstein that turned sexual. Federal prosecutors in New York said Maxwell helped Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately abuse girls as young as 14.\nDespite her conviction at trial in 2021 -- where she declined to take the witness stand -- Maxwell claimed in her interview with Blanche that she had been wrongly accused and did not receive a fair trial. She maintained, as she had done previously in a 2016 deposition in a civil case, that she never recruited anyone underage to massage Epstein and never witnessed or participated in any criminal acts, the sources said.\nFederal prosecutors charged Maxwell with perjury for alleged lies she told during the 2016 deposition. And the government repeatedly assailed her credibility during her criminal case, citing her \"willingness to lie brazenly under oath about her conduct,\" according to court records.\nMaxwell was indicted in July 2020, during the first Trump administration. Her trial occurred in late 2021, while President Joe Biden was in the White House. The perjury counts against her were eventually dropped after her conviction on the more serious charges.\nBlanche's meeting with Maxwell came just days after the Justice Department fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York with the most detailed knowledge of the case. Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, led the criminal prosecution of Maxwell.\nBlanche -- the top deputy to U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi --indicated that the goal of the Maxwell meeting was to determine if she had \"information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims,\" according to a July 22 statement posted to social media by the DOJ.\nAccording to sources familiar with internal deliberations that preceded the meeting with Maxwell, Blanche was encouraged by some top administration officials to seek information that could lead to criminal investigations that might quiet the outrage from some of Trump's most vocal supporters.\n\"The FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche wrote in the post. \"Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government. That changes now.\"\nSources told ABC News, however, that it was Maxwell's legal team that initiated the request for the meeting. Maxwell has a pending application before the U.S. Supreme Court to review her conviction. Her lawyers have stated that they have not yet asked President Trump to commute her sentence or to pardon her, but that Maxwell \"would welcome any relief.\"\nBlanche was accompanied by an FBI agent and another DOJ official and Maxwell was with three of her attorneys, according to sources familiar with the meeting.\nThe unusual meeting involving the nation's second-ranking law enforcement official and a convicted sex-trafficker evoked a strong response from some victims of Epstein and Maxwell.\nAnnie Farmer, one of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial, told a federal court last week that she and other victims \"unequivocally object to any potential leniency that the government may be considering for Maxwell.\"\nDuring nine hours of questioning over two days, Maxwell was quizzed by Blanche about dozens of famous people -- politicians, business titans and Hollywood stars -- who had previously been named as having associated with Epstein. And in each instance, Maxwell indicated that she had never witnessed nor heard about any alleged wrongdoing, the sources said.\nMaxwell's attorney, David Markus, told reporters after the meetings concluded that his client had been asked by Blanche about \"one hundred different people.\"\n\"She didn't hold anything back,\" Markus said.\nAmong those Blanche inquired about, sources told ABC News, were tech billionaires Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman and Elon Musk; political figures Ehud Barak, Robert Kennedy Jr. and the late U.S. Senator George Mitchell; and celebrities Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and Naomi Campbell.\nThe rumored existence of an apocryphal \"Epstein client list\" has long fueled speculation of a \"deep state\" cover-up to protect an elite cabal of alleged participants in Epstein's crimes. Some of the most vocal purveyors of the theory -- including FBI Director Kash Patel and his top deputy Dan Bongino -- have since taken up prominent posts in the Trump administration.\nBut Maxwell said there was no such list and that she saw no indication that Epstein had obtained compromising information that he used to extort others, according to the sources who were briefed on the interview.\nAt one point in the interview, Maxwell likened the quest to find others complicit in Epstein's crimes to the Salem witch trials of the 17th century, according to a person familiar with what Maxwell said.\nSignificant portions of the interview were dedicated to inquiries about President Trump and ex-President Bill Clinton.\nBefore any allegations of sexual misconduct against Epstein surfaced in 2005, Trump and Clinton each spoke glowingly of Epstein, and court records have included documents and testimony indicating that -- at separate times -- both men flew with Epstein on his private jets.\nClinton's association with Epstein was first noted publicly in 2002, after reporters learned of the former president's journey that year on Epstein's jet for a humanitarian mission to multiple African nations. Clinton told New York magazine through a spokesman at the time that \"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science.\"\nIn that same article, Trump boasted of his friendship with Epstein, saying, \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy.\"\n\"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life,\" Trump told the magazine.\nMaxwell told Blanche she had a friendship with former President Clinton after being introduced by a mutual acquaintance, the sources said. Maxwell said she had suggested to Epstein that he allow Clinton to use his private jumbo jet to fly to multiple international destinations in Africa, Asia and Europe in the early 2000s. Clinton, Maxwell said, had no particular interest in Epstein other than having the use of his plane.\nDespite President Trump's oft-repeated claims that Clinton had traveled more than 20 times to Little St. James -- Epstein's private U.S. Virgin Islands estate where much of Epstein's abuse is alleged to have occurred -- Maxwell said the former president had never been there and wouldn't have wanted to go, because he had no relationship with Epstein, according to sources familiar with what Maxwell told Blanche.\nBill Clinton has previously said through a spokesperson that he \"knew nothing\" about Epstein's crimes, had never visited the island, and that all the flights on Epstein's aircraft in 2002 and 2003 were associated with work for the Clinton Foundation.\nAs for the current president, Maxwell said that she first knew of Trump through her late father, who purchased the New York Daily News in 1991. She said she only saw Trump and Epstein, both native New Yorkers, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.\nAnd at a time when her legal team has publicly signaled her hopes for a reprieve from the president, Maxwell, the sources said, expressed admiration for Trump.\nPublished reports in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal last month indicated that the decision not to release the Epstein files came after President Trump was informed in May that his name was among those that appeared multiple times in the documents. The president has denied that he was told his name appeared in the files.\nThe appearance of a name in the Epstein files is not evidence of illicit activity.\nPresident Trump has said he ended his association with Epstein before any allegations of sexual abuse were raised in Florida in the mid 2000s.\nTrump said in 2019, after Epstein's arrest for child sex trafficking, that he hadn't spoken to him in 15 years. More recently, the president has claimed he split with Epstein after discovering Epstein was allegedly poaching employees from the spa at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach.\nMaxwell was escorted from her prison cell in Tallahassee to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the two days of meetings with Blanche. A week later, she was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison camp for women in Texas, with no official explanation for the move.\nMaxwell is the Oxford-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell, the larger-than-life publishing baron whose rags-to-riches story captivated England. She lived an extravagant life among the British elite until her father's business empire collapsed in the wake of his death in 1991. She relocated to New York looking for a fresh start and was soon seen in the company of the mysterious multimillionaire Epstein.\nEpstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy and child sex trafficking. He died in custody a month later, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.\nCopyright © 2025, ABC Audio. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Updated August 22, 2025 at 19:19 PM ET\nThe Justice Department on Friday released what it says is the complete transcript and audio recording of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's conversations with Ghislaine Maxwell last month.\nMaxwell was the longtime partner of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and was sentenced to a 20-year prison term for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Blanche met with her in Tallahassee, Fla., over the course of two days in late July. The transcripts, running hundreds of pages in length, are marked \"redacted.\"\nBlanche posted the files on social media and said they were shared \"in the interest of transparency.\"\nIn a statement, an attorney for Maxwell said she told the truth in the interview and insisted she is a scapegoat.\n\"Ms. Maxwell answered every question,\" said attorney David Markus. \"She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question. She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanor and credibility are clear for anyone to hear. She was able to do this despite five torturous years in custody, some of which in the worst imaginable conditions.\"\nThe Trump administration has faced increased pressure from Democrats as well as some supporters inside the GOP to share more information about any files it has on Epstein and his case.\nWhat she said about President Trump\nOver the course of the interview, Maxwell was asked about a wide array of officials who may have known or been in contact with Epstein, including President Trump. Epstein and Trump belonged to the same Palm Beach social circle, but Trump has long maintained his friendship with Epstein ended before the disgraced financier was indicted for soliciting prostitution in 2006.\nMaxwell told Blanche that she may have met Trump at some point in 1990 because he had been friendly with her father. She said Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me,\" adding that she never witnessed him in any \"inappropriate setting.\"\n\"I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects,\" Maxwell said.\nAsked about Trump's relationship with Epstein, Maxwell said she did not think they were \"close friends.\"\n\"I don't recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance,\" she told prosecutors.\nEpstein's reach\nMaxwell was also asked about Epstein's interactions with former President Bill Clinton. When Blanche pressed her on whether Clinton had received a massage, Maxwell said no.\n\"I don't believe he did,\" she said, adding that the only time Epstein and Clinton spent time together was on Epstein's plane.\n\"So they spent time on the plane together, and I don't believe there was ever a massage on the plane. So that would've been the only time that I think that President Clinton could have even received a massage. And he didn't, because I was there,\" she said.\nThe interviews provide insight into the connections Epstein was able to forge with some of the most well-known and influential figures in government, business and culture — even if those relationships were not themselves known to have been nefarious.\nAmong those discussed in the interview are figures such as Bill Gates, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and current Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, among others. Maxwell said she was unaware of any inappropriate activity involving any of them, though she did share that she and Epstein had gone \"dinosaur bone hunting in the Dakotas\" with Kennedy.\nAn unusual meeting\nBlanche's meeting with Maxwell was highly unusual for involving such a senior Justice Department official. Also at the interview were Diego Pestana, the acting associate deputy attorney general, Spencer Horn, an FBI special agent, and Mark Beard, deputy U.S. Marshal.\nMaxwell and her legal team appear to be making a pitch for clemency in some form. As president, Trump has flexed his power to commute — or shorten — existing prison terms, and to pardon people who have offered him support in the past. Within days of her interview with Blanche, she was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. Officials did not explain the reason for the transfer.\nThe release of the transcripts on Friday came on the same day that the Justice Department shared a first wave of files from its probes into Epstein and Maxwell with members of the House Oversight Committee. The committee subpoenaed the agency for the records earlier this month.\nThe panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky., says he plans to make at least some of the records available to the public, but has faced criticism from Democrats — and some Republicans — who say they worry the release will be far from comprehensive.\nCopyright 2025 NPR"
