      "On Sunday, August 17, 2025, the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation launched a pilot reservation system at the Saudi Neighborhood distribution site, enrolling 350 participants to reserve aid parcels in advance.",
      "Under the previous model, younger men outpaced women, children, older men and people with disabilities, and multiple violent incidents at aid distribution sites caused deaths, prompting the new initiative for orderly access.",
      "Under the new system, trained local workers take participants’ photos and issue ID cards with unique numbers, setting aside aid packages on specific days and enabling direct communication with participating families.",
      "GHF Executive Director John Acree called the launch \"real progress,\" saying the program brings more ease, dignity and order to the collection process and responds to President Donald Trump's call for innovation.",
      "In the coming weeks, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's pilot program is expected to scale up fully, supported by at least $30 million in U.S. government contributions after delivering nearly 125 million meals."
