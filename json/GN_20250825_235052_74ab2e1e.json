      "text": "President Donald Trump has referred to the trade deficit as a loss, as if we lose money by buying imports. But we don‚Äôt lose money when we trade to obtain goods produced by foreigners. This is like saying we lose when we have a trade deficit with the local grocery store. Every week I buy goods from the grocer, and he doesn‚Äôt buy any goods from me. But I gain because I get food to eat.\nFree international trade raises our standard of living because it enables us to obtain less expensive goods and goods that cannot be produced in the U.S. Tariffs are taxes that raise the cost of bringing goods into the U.S. and thus make goods more expensive. They also protect inefficient domestic producers by restricting competition from foreigners. They, therefore, make it possible for these producers to remain in business when they would otherwise be driven out of business.\nWe don‚Äôt want inefficient producers to remain in business, even when they are domestic producers competing against foreigners. We want the most efficient and effective producers to prevail in the market. This is how we get the best products at the lowest price and how the standard of living is raised. Even domestic producers driven out of business gain once they find another area in the economy where their skills are more highly demanded.\nDomestic producers don‚Äôt have a right to anyone‚Äôs business. If you want to buy goods from foreigners rather than domestic producers, you have the right to do so. It‚Äôs a violation of your rights for the government to attempt to stop you or make it harder through tariffs.\nWe have no duty to purchase domestically produced products just so domestic producers can continue in their current line of work. This is a collectivist idea that must be rejected (for humanity‚Äôs sake no less). If domestic producers want your business, they need to compete more effectively.\nTariffs not only harm consumers, but they also harm domestic producers who use foreign made inputs in their businesses. More than half of all imports are purchased by domestic producers. By imposing tariffs, we push their costs and prices up and reduce employment in these businesses.\nThis helps one understand that tariffs don‚Äôt save jobs. They save less productive jobs at less efficient businesses at the expense of more productive jobs at more efficient businesses. Free international trade and tariffs change the pattern of employment, not the overall level of employment.\nDo we need tariffs for national security? No. The only proper purpose of the government is to protect individual rights, including from aggression by foreigners. If the government deems it necessary to produce a product domestically for national security purposes, it can just purchase the product domestically.\nTrump economic advisor Peter Navarro believes we need tariffs to have fair trade. But free trade is fair trade. Free trade makes it possible for people to buy goods they think are best for pursuing their own happiness. It‚Äôs unfair and immoral to violate people‚Äôs rights, through tariffs, by making it harder or impossible for them to purchase goods they prefer.\nTrump says we need tariffs as a negotiation tool to achieve lower tariffs in other countries, and this will help lead to free trade. It would be beneficial to eliminate tariffs around the world. But you don‚Äôt establish free trade by violating the freedom to trade.\nThe age-old principle ‚Äútwo wrongs don‚Äôt make a right‚Äù also applies here. Other governments using tariffs to violate the freedom of their citizens to trade doesn‚Äôt justify our government doing the same. The best policy to follow is one of unilateral free trade: eliminate all our tariffs and push other countries to do the same. This, ultimately, is the only way to achieve free trade.\nSome Trump supporters might claim that I suffer from TDS, so my arguments aren‚Äôt valid. This is an ‚Äúargument‚Äù that is used to evade the arguments I‚Äôm making. If you can‚Äôt refute someone‚Äôs arguments, attack the person making the arguments instead to try and prevent people from seeing that you can‚Äôt refute his arguments. It‚Äôs an implicit admission that you have no argument to back up your claims.\nEvery argument for tariffs is invalid. They are immoral and economically harmful. Free international trade is just one aspect of the freedom of the individual to further his own life and well-being that a laissez-faire capitalist society protects. Protecting the freedom and rights of the individual is what makes capitalism the only moral type of society. It also leads to the greatest rate of economic progress and highest standard of living that are possible.\nBrian P.

Every so-called expert on cable TV preached that they would crush American consumers, tank the stock market, and send our economy into a spiral.\nWe‚Äôre still waiting for that to happen.\nHere we are in Aug. 2025, and the Congressional Budget Office just dropped a bombshell that completely shatters the left‚Äôs narrative against Trump‚Äôs tariff strategy.\nAs of August 19, we estimate that the effective tariff rate for goods imported into the United States has increased by about 18 percentage points when measured against 2024 trade flows. We project that increases in tariffs implemented during the period from January 6, 2025, to August 19 will decrease primary deficits (which exclude net outlays for interest) by $3.3 trillion if the higher tariffs persist for the 2025‚Äí2035 period. By reducing the need for federal borrowing, those tariff collections will also reduce federal outlays for interest by an additional $0.7 trillion. As a result, the changes in tariffs will reduce total deficits by $4.0 trillion altogether.\nThat‚Äôs no rounding error.\nThe numbers are simply eye-popping, and they tell the story that the media doesn‚Äôt want you to know.\nLet‚Äôs put that in perspective. Back in June, the CBO had already stunned critics by predicting Trump‚Äôs tariffs would shrink the deficit by $3 trillion. That was based only on trade actions taken through May 13.\nTrump, naturally, celebrated the news on Truth Social.\n‚ÄúI am pleased to announce that the Radical Left Representatives working at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have now admitted how incredible my Tariff strategy has been, saying that, ‚ÄòTrump‚Äôs Tariffs reduce the deficit by $4 Trillion Dollars,‚Äô‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWhen I began my Tariff policy suggestions, they refused to acknowledge the potential SUCCESS that would be derived.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!‚Äù\nICYMI: This Must Be Why Liberal Women Are Bonkers\nOf course, the CBO is cautious to note its projections assume these trade policies remain in place indefinitely. It also didn‚Äôt factor in several adjustments announced just this past week: new EU tariff arrangements on August 21, a 25% tariff hike on imports from India starting Aug. 27, and the suspension of duty-free shipments under $800 coming Aug. 29. In other words, the real revenue picture could easily turn out even stronger than the current forecast.\nHere‚Äôs the bigger point no one in the mainstream press will admit: tariffs, when wielded strategically, can be a double win. They level the playing field for American producers, whom foreign governments have undercut for decades by gaming the system, and they generate revenue that actually reduces the insane borrowing spree Washington politicians tried to normalize.\nThey told us Trump‚Äôs tariffs would wreck the economy‚Äîyet deficits are plummeting by trillions, numbers the media ignores.

This revenue projection doesn't include the changes in tariff rates announced on August 21 with the European Union, the scheduled August 27 increase in the tariff rate on imports from India by an additional 25 percent, or the August 29 suspension of duty-free entry for commercial shipments of less than $800.\nThe analysis reflects expiring tariff programs. Higher tariffs rates brought more revenue than projected in January.\nThrough July, the Treasury reports that duties have totaled $136 billion, with $28 billion collected in July alone.\nIf there are no further changes in tariff rates, the CBO project that customs duties from new and existing tariffs will total about $200 billion this fiscal year.\nThe CBO's next short-term forecast will publish on September 12.

The CBO has said that it would add around $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the coming decade, although the White House has disputed those figures.\nThe Trump administration has also said that the tariffs and policies initiated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump backed and signed into law, would bring forth economic growth over the coming years that would offset any additions to the national deficit.\n‚ÄúIt was the largest tax cut for middle- and working-class families in our nation‚Äôs history, and the president wants to see this country get our fiscal house in order. That‚Äôs why this was a fiscally responsible bill,‚Äù White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 21 in response to the CBO report on the bill.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the White House again touted the bill by posting excerpts from a series of recent newspaper articles that praised the measure. Earlier this month, the administration also said that Americans would see an average tax cut of $3,752 under the bill, citing a report from nonprofit organization the Tax Foundation.\nFriday‚Äôs report from the CBO comes as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada would scrap some of its retaliatory tariffs against the United States. Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico earlier this year, saying those measures were necessary to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the country.\n‚ÄúWe have the best deal of anyone in the world right now,‚Äù Carney told reporters in Ottawa. ‚ÄúToday, the government of Canada is harmonizing its tariffs with the U.S.‚Äù\nReuters contributed to this report."

CBO officials say this increase will help draw down primary deficits by a whopping $3.3 trillion if the higher tariff rate continues for the period of 2025-2035.\nOne of the reasons for the drop, according to the CBO, is that the tariffs reduce the need for federal borrowing. The money collected from the tariffs will reduce federal outlays for interest by another $0.7 trillion. The total reduction in deficits will reach $4 trillion.\nThe numbers are higher than those proposed back in June. The data used to come up with these estimates is gleaned from the Census Bureau, Customs and Border Protection, and the Treasury Department.\n‚ÄúThe methods account for a diversion of trade from countries facing high tariff rates to other countries facing lower tariff rates. The estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, largely owing to questions about timing, possible exceptions, and a lack of precedents,‚Äù the CBO wrote.\nWhile this is good news, not everything the CBO stated in its latest report was positive. In fact, according to The Hill, the report claims that the president‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big, Beautiful Bill‚Äù is fueling economic inequality, a claim that Vice President JD Vance ripped to shreds.\n‚ÄúFirst of all, the Congressional Budget Office, sometimes they put out reports that are absolutely atrocious, and I think this is a good example of a very atrocious report,‚Äù he remarked during an address, leading to loud applause from the audience.\n‚ÄúThe CBO report, which was done at the request of Democrats, found that the top 10 percent of earners in the country will see an average boost of $13,600 per year over the next decade as a direct result of provisions in the law, while the bottom 10 percent will see an average annual decrease of $1,200,‚Äù The Hill said.\n‚ÄúThe most important thing for people who are living at the bottom of the income ladder is that they not pay taxes on their income sources,‚Äù the vice president added.\nHe then said, ‚ÄúSo, if you‚Äôre working hard and you‚Äôre working overtime, you‚Äôre going to get a big fat tax cut. If you‚Äôre working at a restaurant or some other business where you‚Äôre earning your wages primarily through tips, you‚Äôre going to get a big fat tax cut. And most importantly, the president‚Äôs economic policies are going to prevent your job from being shipped off to Asia or to Mexico. That is the very best thing for people at the bottom of the income ladder.‚Äù"

(hint: not the U.S. working class. It‚Äôs mainly been Wall Street types reaping $trillions in labor arbitrage).\nAnd how stupid has the U.S. been to outsource 1. defense electronics, 2. pharmaceutical manufacturing, 3. rare-earth metals and magnets, 4. computer chip manufacturing, 5. advanced machining manufacturing, 6. Ship manufacturing.\nI thank the heavens above for Elon Musk, the petroleum industry, and even a narcissist scoundrel like Donald Trump.\n(The Inflation Reduction Act could have been great in jump-starting U.S. manufacturing. Unfortunately, it was riddled with so much under-the-table graft & DEI regulations that no large manufacturer could make it work‚Ä¶)\nOur World in Data provides weighted mean applied tariff rates (not simple averages) across all products, based on the World Bank‚Äôs World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) system, which uses UNCTAD TRAINS and UN Comtrade data. These rates are weighted by import shares, reflecting the actual tariff burden on traded goods rather than an unweighted average across all tariff lines. According to Our World in Data (last updated January 2025, with data up to 2022), typical weighted mean applied tariffs for these countries are lower:\nChina: ~3.5% (2022, all products, weighted mean)\nEU (Germany, France, Italy): ~2.7% (2022, trade-weighted average, per Penn Wharton Budget Model)\nJapan: ~2.5% (2022, weighted mean)\nIndia: ~6.0% (2022, weighted mean)\nUnited Kingdom: ~2.0% (2022, post-Brexit, aligned with EU rates)\nBrazil: ~7.5% (2022, weighted mean)\nCanada: ~1.5% (2022, weighted mean, noting USMCA preferences)\nSouth Korea: ~5.0% (2022, weighted mean)\nThese figures are significantly lower than the simple average MFN tariffs\nYes. Thank you for the data!\nCanadian Dairy tarrifs only apply after a limit is reached. That limit has not yet been reached and as a result no tarrifs have been placed on USA dairy. Also, USA massively subsidies its own dairy system. Perplexity AI said as much as 70 percent of USA dairy farm income has been by direct and indirect government subsidies.\nMaybe both sides need to level the playing field.\nFor the EU countries, threeremarks:\n‚Äì The tarifs are way less than Trump proposes and targetted to protect groups.\n‚Äì In most cases food related to indeed protect local farmers but also for security reasons to produce your own food.\n‚Äì However, the amount of tax we pay in Europe is way higher than in the US. Tariffs are paid by regular people.\nI have my serous doubts:\n‚Äì Tarifs are taxes payed by regular citizens. Hence they will have 4 trillion dollars less in their pockets. This basically means they have less to spend.\n‚Äì With less compition, prices will go up anayway\n‚Äì For foreign investors, a stable market and certinty is a big thing. The US has become untrustworthy and unstable. Why would you invest billions if in 4 years another president goes a completely different way. Or Trump does.\n‚Äì ICE is deporting a million people that would do these low payed jobs. The US does not have the free labour to fill these low paying jobs. Even worse, higher paying jobs are sarificed so people can glue sneakers or iron underwear. Somehow thats not more added value‚Ä¶.\n‚Äì In the past tarifs were already tried and failed. The US in the 30th and (slightly different setup) the UK when they left the EU. Both did not work.\nTariffs will make manufacture in the US more profitable, and thus more likely. I doubt this CBO estimate takes increased tax revenues from factories, their construction, and their employees into account.\nWhen I was a child only luxury goods, and some raw materials were imported into the US. I‚Äôd like to see that again. The best way to achieve this would be for the world to go back to a gold standard.\nTariffs will not make manufacturing in US more profitable. Global markets allowed every US manufacturer and every customer to find exactly what they needed in terms of specs, quality and price. A US manufacturer will either have to pay the tariff on external component they needed, find a US supplier that did not choose in the first place (either for price or specs) or develop internally the component. Since US recognises international patents developing internally or find someone in US will not always work. And also hoping that all your non-US manufacturer will relocate production to US is delusional. Many critical components or reagents are location-locked with one or few plants extracting-refining-producing 90% of a given mineral,reagent,drug or component. A company that is producing worldwide with plants developed in decades will not double its production costs to develop a plant in an uncertain environment like the US. What if they spend billions and then tariffs are revoked overnight? What if they planned to build in California or Illinois but then the president deploys the national guard reducing access to highway and rail because of arbitrary inspections? No. Trump increased uncertainty and uncertainty is catastrophic for investments and profitable manufacturing.\nAnd that $4T will be paid for almost entirely by the US consumer. And it will be even worse that that since US companies will raise their prices just as they did during the last Trump tariffs.\nMany exporters will lower prices to retain market share. If they don‚Äôt, US producers will sell more, increasing US employment, and productivity.\nPutting op an import wall was already tried in the UK. It works out slighly different..\nWith competition being more expensive, US producers will raise prices, simply because they can.\nThe uncertainty allone will cause people to stop buying.\nThe result for for instance car sales: People stop buying new cars, low incomes simply cannot, a bit higher income classes will go for more used cars. Hence the used cars will go up in price limiting even more people to buy a car all together.\nDon‚Äôt you mean debt, not deficit?\nGood question, but the linked source does say deficit:\n‚ÄúAs of August 19, we estimate that the effective tariff rate for goods imported into the United States has increased by about 18 percentage points when measured against 2024 trade flows. We project that increases in tariffs implemented during the period from January 6, 2025, to August 19 will decrease primary deficits (which exclude net outlays for interest) by $3.3 trillion if the higher tariffs persist for the 2025‚Äí2035 period. By reducing the need for federal borrowing, those tariff collections will also reduce federal outlays for interest by an additional $0.7 trillion. As a result, the changes in tariffs will reduce total deficits by $4.0 trillion altogether.‚Äù\nThat‚Äôs how deep in the red spending is after the extension of the Trump tax cuts is, even with the DOGE cuts, which recent government estimates say will result in 300,000 jobs lost in the federal government; salaries are not the main cost to government, and the efficiencies and services lost detract from citizen productivity too; how many discoveries, lives lost or bankruptcies made (from additional unchecked fraud from cutting the CFPB, for example) will there be? DOGE cut the meat as well as the fat from government. For now at least, it added to the unemployment roles; that‚Äôs a negative to the tax base.\nHowever, the CBO is basically trying to pin a value on ever-changing Jello:\n‚ÄúWhat Assumptions Does CBO Make When Projecting Tariff Revenues?\nWhen the Administration modifies tariffs through an administrative action, we assume that the tariffs then in effect will continue permanently without changes. We incorporate changes announced by the Administration after they are implemented. Thus, our projection of revenues from tariffs in effect as of August 19, 2025, does not include the changes in tariff rates announced in an August 21 joint statement with the European Union, the scheduled August 27 increase in the tariff rate on imports from India (by an additional 25 percent), or the August 29 suspension of duty-free entry for commercial shipments of less than $800.‚Äù\nHow can any business ‚Äì domestic or foreign ‚Äì plan around that and what‚Äôs the cost of being unable to? What‚Äôs the cost of losing imports from countries with a comparative advantage; e.g. Canada with its superior hard wood lumber vs. softer American lumber due to warmer temps here (homebuilders prefer harder wood) etc? What‚Äôs the cost of having Americans harvest American agriculture instead of cheaper & better migrant labor (farmers complain America workers don‚Äôt last a day doing what migrant labor does for years, no matter what the pay)? What‚Äôs the cost of inflation vs. the savings in the deficit over 10 years? From CBO:\n‚ÄúThe increases in tariffs will make consumer goods and capital goods (the physical assets that businesses use to produce goods and services) more expensive, which will reduce the purchasing power of U.S. consumers and businesses. Those increases in costs will put temporary upward pressure on inflation.‚Äù\nThe CBO article is worth a full read."

The current top tariff rates may not hold as negotiations with trading partners and international legal challenges are ongoing.\n‚ÄúWe estimate that the effective tariff rate for goods imported into the United States has increased by about 18 percentage points when measured against 2024 trade flows,‚Äù the budget office said in its report, adding that Trump‚Äôs tariffs would reduce ‚Äúthe need for federal borrowing.‚Äù\nThe CBO also said it ‚Äúprojects further increases in tariff revenues in the coming months‚Äù and that ‚Äúif there are no further changes in tariff rates, we project that customs duties from new and existing tariffs will total about $200 billion this fiscal year.‚Äù\nBut the office cautioned that revenues often lag several months behind the implementation of tariff policies, noting that once the rates are in effect, they don‚Äôt get applied to goods that are already in transit to the United States.\n‚ÄúIn addition, importers have the option to delay payments by up to six weeks by participating in Customs and Border Protection‚Äôs Periodic Monthly Statement program,‚Äù added the CBO, which is a federal agency within the legislative branch that provides budget and economic information to both houses of Congress.\nIn July, Congress passed the GOP-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that contained several major Trump priorities on energy, the border, spending, and tax cuts. The CBO has said that it would add around $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the coming decade, although the White House has disputed those figures.\nThe Trump administration has also said that the tariffs and policies initiated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump backed and signed into law, would bring forth economic growth over the coming years that would offset any additions to the national deficit.\n‚ÄúIt was the largest tax cut for middle and working class families in our nation‚Äôs history, and the president wants to see this country get our fiscal house in order. That‚Äôs why this was a fiscally responsible bill,‚Äù White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 21 in response to the CBO report on the bill.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the White House again touted the bill by posting excerpts from a series of recent newspaper articles that praised the measure. Earlier this month, the administration also said that Americans would see an average tax cut of $3,752 under the bill, citing a report from nonprofit organization the Tax Foundation.\nFriday‚Äôs report from the CBO comes as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada would scrap some of its retaliatory tariffs against the United States. Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico earlier this year, saying those measures were necessary to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the country.\n‚ÄúWe have the best deal of anyone in the world right now,‚Äù Carney told reporters in Ottawa. ‚ÄúToday, the Government of Canada is harmonizing its tariffs with the U.S.‚Äù\nTyler Durden\nFri, 08/22/2025 ‚Äì 18:25\nRead further at ZeroHedge"

CBO estimated this would widen the deficit by US$3.4 trillion over the next decade.\nThe US federal debt is US$37.18 trillion, according to the treasury department. It has continued to grow under Republican and Democratic administrations as the US Congress continues to authorise the federal government to spend more money than it takes in.\nLawmakers face a government funding deadline at the end of September or risk a shutdown if spending bills are not passed.\nThe latest CBO estimate marks an increase from June when it forecast a US$2.5 trillion reduction in primary deficits and a US$500 billion cut in interest outlays.\nUS tariff rates across countries and products averaged 16.7% in August, up from 15.1% in June, according to Oxford Economics.\nMore than US$26 billion in duties have been assessed by US Customs and Border Protection this fiscal year, far surpassing the hundreds of millions recorded in the previous year, according to the analysis."
