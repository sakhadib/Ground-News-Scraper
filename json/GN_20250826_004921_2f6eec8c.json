But I’ll know what I am going to do in two weeks.”\nThe US president said he began pushing for a Putin-Zelenskyy sit-down after separate talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, followed by a phone call with Putin.

Trump has often voiced frustration that despite his efforts, he has not been able to bring the war to an end."

Although he survived and recovered in Germany, Navalny was imprisoned upon returning to Russia and died in an Arctic penal colony last February.\nWell, now that multiple countries are talking about negotiating an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, where does the Russian opposition movement stand today? That is a question we're going to put to Mikhail Fishman, a host with the independent Russian news outlet TV Rain. He joins us now from Amsterdam, where he is currently based. Welcome.\nMIKHAIL FISHMAN: Hi. Yes, thank you for having me.\nCHANG: Let me ask you - since Alexei Navalny's death, who has emerged as the leader of the opposition now? Anyone in particular?\nFISHMAN: Navalny's death has been more than a loss for Russian opposition. Russia's democratic project is over for many years for now. It was over even before the war started. But there was hope. And this hope that Russia can return to democracy, that Russia can join the club of civilized nations, that everything can be OK and fine - the bearer of this hope was Navalny. He had this moral authority. He reinvented how to do politics of protesting. He created his own base. Hope and expectations were with him.\nCHANG: Well, then, if hope and expectations lived and died with Alexei Navalny, how much agreement is there now within the Russian opposition movement on other policy aims, beyond simply standing against Putin's authoritarian government?\nFISHMAN: We should talk about resistance rather than of opposition. But now, it doesn't have this guiding light. His camp, his team, has become the target for attacks from within the opposition. It just represents the whole disarray and deflation that the Russian opposition finds itself in now.\nCHANG: Yes, I want to talk about that disarray because I noted you are physically in Amsterdam, and yeah, most opposition parties and independent media have had to leave Russia. How much are messages that are critical of the Putin regime even being heard inside Russia now, especially as crackdowns on dissent have intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine?\nFISHMAN: Well, that's a very good question, and Putin's regime has been quite efficient in censorship and silencing the voices from the outside. The YouTube is basically down in Russia. Now they are on the brink of shutting down WhatsApp and Telegram, and we expect it to happen really soon. It's already started happening but not to the degree that they expected. We see it by our own numbers, by data, for our own broadcasts. In YouTube, we see that we still have quite a significant audience in Russia. I, personally, or my colleagues from TV Rain or other journalistic teams, are targeted on basically a weekly basis by Russian propaganda. And that means that we still matter.\nCHANG: Well, now that there is some international momentum to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, do you think the opposition has more leverage now in calling for things like the freeing of political prisoners as part of some international prisoner exchange deal?\nFISHMAN: I would say the only issue that has been brought to the table by Russian resistance, Russian opposition, Russian human-rights watchers - and this is the fate of political prisoners. And the most prominent voice here is the voice of Dmitry Muratov, editor of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. He appeals for months during every phase of these negotiations. He appeals to all the sides of the conflict, including Washington, to add the release of political prisoners to the agenda of these negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. It's actually a joint effort of human rights watchers in Ukraine, as well as in Russia, to bring political prisoners' fate to the negotiating table.\nCHANG: Mikhail Fishman, host with the independent Russian news outlet TV Rain, thank you very much for joining us today.\nFISHMAN: Thank you very much.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR.

      "text": "Anchorage – a light at the end of the tunnel?\nby Paul Craig Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts:\nAttention Readers: Here I present a response from a Russian geopolitical expert to the Trump-Putin meeting and the unfolding dynamics. We are fortunate to have a view from outside the American media.\nAnchorage – a light at the end of the tunnel?\nBy Ivan Andrianov, Founder and CEO of IntellGlobe Solutions (https://igs.expert/), a strategic consulting firm specializing in geopolitical risk analysis, international security, and political forecasting.\nOne would like to believe so, but for now this tunnel looks more like a maze, one that the United States and Russia still have to find their own way out of – while also leading others out.\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\nBefore turning to the high politics discussed at the summit in Anchorage, Alaska, it seems appropriate to point to two seemingly positive moments that somehow passed almost unnoticed. First, at the post-talks press appearance, Vladimir Putin read from a prepared text. Moreover, he skipped four pages, setting them aside. And second, Russia allowed America’s ExxonMobil to reclaim its stakes in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project. The Russian president’s decree was published on August 15, the day of his meeting with Donald Trump. The document supplemented a decree that in October 2022 transferred the Sakhalin-1 operator into Russian jurisdiction; at that time, instead of ExxonMobil, the operator became LLC “Sakhalin-1”.\nWhat does this tell us? Despite many media claims, one can state that not only the summit, but also the visit to Moscow by U.S. President’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – after which the decision for a personal meeting of the two leaders was announced – was preceded by serious preparatory work that simply cannot be done in a few days. Nor can one prepare a speech text in the thirty minutes that elapsed between the end of the talks and Trump and Putin walking out to the press. As for the return of the American energy giant’s stake in the oil project, given all the bureaucratic and legal formalities, I will venture to say it took more than a month.\nSo all that remains is to congratulate the negotiators of our two countries, who not only managed to set up this meeting, but also avoided premature leaks that could have given opponents of the Russian-American dialogue a chance, if not to derail the Alaska summit, then at least to complicate it. Such concerns existed on both the Russian and the U.S. sides.\nNow to how Russia’s expert and political circles assess the outcome of this meeting, which has already been called historic in both Washington and Moscow. I hope what is meant is that it will become a point of reference from which relations between our countries begin to return to normal.\nAs for the results of the summit, the prevailing view in Moscow is that they should be assessed as successful for both sides. The fact there were no sensations or “breakthroughs” is a sign of the seriousness of what occurred – an acknowledgment by both parties of the complexity of the situation. The sides’ positions have been laid out (to each other and, in fact, to everyone) and, I hope, are not subject to reversal. That is a result.\nThe presidents of the two countries accomplished the minimum tasks they set for this meeting. Trump showed that he is, in effect, the only Western leader who can, in principle, conduct a constructive dialogue with Russia. At the same time, the U.S. president demonstrated to his Euro-Atlantic partners that the outcome of the West’s interaction with Russia depends on him – and on no one else.\nMoscow demonstrated that its demands are recognized and that its security must be taken into account in all variants of a peaceful settlement. This is a fundamental breakthrough. Everything before this proceeded from the simple idea that the West would present Russia with certain conditions to which it was supposedly to agree. The conditions shifted, but the approach remained. Moscow has now achieved that a resolution is possible only through dialogue and with due regard for Russian interests.\nAnother important point – voiced for the first time by both sides – is that European countries bear responsibility for pushing the Ukrainian conflict to a high level of escalation. More importantly, it was finally stated in earnest – not only by Russia – that achieving a long peace is far more significant than the terms for a short-term ceasefire, under cover of which the West will try to rearm the Ukrainian army. Trump said as much in a tough phone call with Zelensky and EU leaders.\nIn this context, two scenarios are forecast for the future development of relations between the Kremlin and the White House. The first – call it the optimal one – is that Russia and the United States resolve the central problem in their bilateral relations and reach an acceptable settlement on Ukraine. Then the remaining issues, including strategic stability, Arctic cooperation, and strategic arms reductions, can be handled quickly and easily. And cooperation in hydrocarbons would be arranged in the spirit of Trump’s favored deal-making. Putin opened the road toward resolving the hydrocarbons question with a decree on potential foreign stakes in the “Sakhalin” project.\nThe second option is that the conflict goes unresolved due to the actions of European countries and their destructive policies. In that case Trump will try to “jump out” of the conflict, but with serious political losses and without any noticeable economic dividends. And Russia will continue grinding down the Ukrainian army, pursuing by military means the objectives announced at the outset of the special military operation (SMO) and reaffirmed by Putin in June of last year."

And not only in our Arctic zone, but also in Alaska. And at the same time, the technologies that we possess, today no one but us possesses.

      "text": "The Russian president stressed that the global scientific community can not be destroyed as it is rooted in unity, not disengagement\nRussia has continued to work with Western scientists despite sanctions and political obstacles, President Vladimir Putin has said.\nSpeaking to workers in Russia’s nuclear sector in the town of Sarov on Friday, Putin noted that the global scientific community cannot be destroyed because it is rooted in unity, not disengagement. He stressed that scientific progress has always relied on cooperation – even during the height of the nuclear arms race.\n“Science, like sports and art, is meant to unite people. It has always been this way, and it will always be this way. No one will be able to destroy the global scientific community,” Putin stated.\nThe West imposed extensive sanctions on Russia in light of the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. As a result, many former partners severed ties and exited the country. Still, Putin noted that a number of joint projects – including in nuclear and space sectors – have continued with both “friendly” nations and some that are aligned with Kiev.\n“By the way, we don’t have unfriendly countries – only unfriendly elites in some… Yes, we’ve suffered in places where cooperation has ceased, especially in science, but work with scientists themselves continues.”\nThe president said Russia lost only Finland among its Western science partners, while, for example, in Hungary Rosatom is still working on a key nuclear project in partnership with French and German firms, despite all three being NATO members.\n“What we did in so-called unfriendly countries, we continue doing. We still supply nuclear fuel in decent quantities and offer nearly the same volume of services,” Putin said. “New areas are emerging too, especially in nuclear medicine and related fields. As for those leaving due to political pressure, I’m sure they’ll return.”\nPutin earlier warned of the long-term harm caused by blocking the development of scientific and educational ties. “We hope Western politicians will understand the damage done by limiting cooperation in science and education,” he said at a Future Technologies Forum. “We’re not going to erect barriers to partnership with Western scientists.”\nDespite the sanctions, one major area of continued cooperation is space. Last month, Russia and the US extended joint work on the International Space Station (ISS). Roscosmos chief Dmitry Bakanov also met NASA acting head Sean Duffy in Houston to discuss ISS operations, future lunar missions, and deep-space exploration projects."

And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,” Putin said, referring to last week’s summit.\n“The next steps now depend on the leadership of the United States, but I am confident that the leadership qualities of the current president, President Trump, are a good guarantee that relations will be restored.”\nCautious Optimism\nHis comments signalled Russia’s optimism that it can mend relations with the U.S. and strike business deals, despite the lack of clear progress towards ending the Ukraine conflict at his August 15 summit with Trump.\nPutin did not give details of possible U.S.-Russia cooperation in the Arctic but said there were “huge, huge” mineral reserves in the region and noted that Russian liquefied natural gas company Novatek was already operating there.\n“We are discussing, by the way, with American partners the possibility of working together in this area. And not only in our Arctic zone, but also in Alaska. And at the same time, the technologies that we possess today no one but us possesses. And this is of interest to our partners, including those from the States,” he said.\nBoth Russia and the United States have said they see enormous economic opportunities if they can normalise relations after ties plunged to a post-Cold War low because of the war in Ukraine.\n(With inputs from Reuters)"

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin says there is “light at the end of the tunnel” in Russia-United States relations, while US President Donald Trump renewed a threat to impose sanctions on Moscow if there is no progress towards a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks. The Russian president, answering questions during a visit to a nuclear research centre on Friday, said he was sure Trump’s leadership qualities would help in restoring relations from recent lows.\n“With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,” Putin said, referring to last week’s summit. “The next steps now depend on the leadership of the United States, but I am confident that the leadership qualities of the current president, President Trump, are a good guarantee that relations will be restored.”\nPutin also said the two countries were discussing joint projects in the Arctic, but he did not give many details. He only said there were “huge, huge” mineral reserves in the region and noted that Russian liquefied natural gas company Novatek was already operating there.\n‘A very important decision’\nBoth Russia and the US have said they see enormous economic opportunities if they can normalise relations after ties plunged to a post-Cold War low because of the war in Ukraine.\nOn Friday, however, Trump said he was unhappy about a Russian strike on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured some of the facility’s employees.\nHe also expressed frustration towards Moscow since there had been no progress in reaching a peaceful settlement in Ukraine in two weeks, despite his meeting about the war with Putin in Alaska.\n“I’m going to make a decision as to what we do and it’s going to be, it’s going to be a very important decision, and that’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it’s your fight,” Trump said.\nTrump added that he had begun making arrangements for a meeting between Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday, soon after concluding White House talks with the Ukrainian president and European leaders and after speaking to Putin by phone.\n‘No agenda’ for Putin-Zelenskyy meeting\nEarlier on Friday, however, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said there was no agenda for a potential summit between Putin and Zelenskyy and that there is no plan for such a meeting.\nSpeaking to NBC’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker”, Lavrov said that Putin had made clear he was ready to meet Zelenskyy to discuss a possible deal to end the war in Ukraine, provided there was a proper agenda for such a session, something he said was lacking for now.\n“Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all,” Lavrov told NBC, saying no meeting was therefore planned for now.\nLavrov said Russia had agreed to show flexibility on a number of issues raised by Trump at a US-Russia summit last week, but accused Ukraine of not showing the same flexibility in talks with Trump and European allies that followed in Washington.\n“He [Trump] clearly indicated – it was very clear to everybody that there are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no NATO membership [for Ukraine], including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelenskyy said no to everything,” said Lavrov.\n“He even said no to, as I said, to cancelling legislation banning the Russian language. How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?”\n‘Moscow wants eastern Donbas’\nTrump had imposed an August 8 deadline for Putin to agree to an end to the war or face new sanctions against Russia and countries that buy its oil, but instead agreed to meet the Kremlin leader at a summit in Alaska last Friday.\nSince then, Russia has shown little movement, maintaining most of its longstanding demands while proposing to freeze the front line in two Ukrainian regions it claims as its own, and expressing a readiness to potentially hand back relatively small pieces of Ukrainian territory it controls.\nPutin wants Ukraine to give up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join NATO, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, three sources familiar with top-level Kremlin thinking told the Reuters news agency.\nZelenskyy, who has said he does not want to “gift” Russia any territory, said on Friday the Kremlin was doing everything it could to make sure that a meeting between him and Putin did not take place. He called on Ukraine’s allies to apply new sanctions on Moscow if it showed no desire to end the war."
