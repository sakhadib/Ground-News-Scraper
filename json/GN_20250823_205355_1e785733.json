Faulkender’s departure from the Treasury Department comes two weeks after President Donald Trump removed former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner Billy Long from his role on Aug. 8.\n“I would like to thank Deputy Secretary Faulkender for his dedication and service,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday in a statement provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Since January, he has played a critical role in overseeing the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s operations and executing on President Trump’s bold economic agenda.”\n“His important work has supported the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill and GENIUS Act, and the leveling of sanctions against our adversaries,” Bessent added.

He also served as chief economist at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute from 2022 until January 2025.\nAdditionally, Trump fired Commissioner of Labor Statistics (BLS) Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 shortly after the release of a disappointing July jobs report. The president announced on Aug. 11 that he selected conservative economist Dr. E.J. Antoni to replace McEntarfer as the next BLS commissioner.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The departure, first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by two sources to Politico, marks another instance of high-level turnover within the Trump administration.\nFaulkender, who the Senate confirmed in late March, is the latest in a series of top officials to leave their posts. His exit follows the removal of former IRS Commissioner Billy Long on August 8 and the firing of Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer on August 1.\nREAD: Trump Says Federal Anti-Crime Effort Will Eye Chicago, New York Following D.C.

The president has since announced his pick to replace McEntarfer, naming conservative economist Dr. E.J.

He had previously been a professor of finance at the University of Maryland's business school. He worked at the Treasury in various capacities during President Donald Trump's first term in office, and helped with the administration's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nFor a time earlier this year, Faulkender served as the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. Bessent put him in the post in April after a disagreement with Elon Musk over who should lead the agency. Bessent replaced Gary Shapley, who had been installed at the urging of Musk without Bessent's knowledge. Earlier this month, the Senate-confirmed head of the agency, former Representative Billy Long, was also replaced at the IRS, this time by Bessent himself, who will serve as acting commissioner until a replacement is found."
