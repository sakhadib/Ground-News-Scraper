      "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday renewed his threat to impose sanctions on Russia unless progress is made to reach a peace deal with Ukraine, as tensions between Moscow and Washington escalated.\nTrump appeared to set a two-week deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to show more willingness to end his invasion of Ukraine. So far, Moscow hasn’t offered any concessions for a truce deal and has demanded more territorial concessions from Kyiv.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump said he would “make a decision as to what we do, and it’s going to be a very important decision, and that’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or do we do nothing and say it’s your fight?”"

      "text": "Trump choked — but the rest of the GOP followed him anyway\nLindsay Graham says he believes Donald Trump is ready to “crush” the Russian economy if that country’s leader, Vladimir Putin, doesn’t agree to peace talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n“Trump believes that if Putin doesn’t do his part, that he’s going to have to crush his economy,” the US senator told reporters in South Carolina on Tuesday. “Because you’ve got to mean what you say.”\nThis is an amazing thing to say.\nJust three days prior, Trump met with Putin in Alaska for three hours. Beforehand, he said there would be “severe consequences” if Putin didn’t agree to a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. Trump said he “solved six wars in six months,” implying that this one would be no different.\nThen he choked.\nHis demands melted into the air. He was all smiles, all handshakes, all deference verging on reverence. The leader of the world’s most powerful military emerged from his meeting with a cut-rate tyrant as if he’d been dogwalked. It was so bad even a Fox reporter had to admit it looked like “Putin came in and steamrolled, got right into what he wanted to say and got his photo next to the president and then left.”\nThe Post’s George Will, who is not a liberal, also saw the plain truth. “The former KGB agent currently indicted for war crimes felt no need to negotiate with the man-child,” Will said (my stress). “The president’s thunderous demands — a 50-day deadline, a 10-day deadline, 'severe consequences,' a ceasefire before negotiations — all were just noise.\"\nSo yes. Senator Graham is right. You’ve got to mean what you say. Trump doesn’t. Indeed, he never does. That’s why he choked.\nBecause of that, he and other Trump allies have spent their time in the days after that disastrous “summit” trying to rewrite history in order to protect the president from the consequences of his own weakness.\nGraham now says Trump is ready to “crush” the Russian economy, as if Trump really were the big strong man he portrays himself to be, rather than the milksop who actually called Putin “the boss” and later phoned him during a meeting with European leaders, as if getting permission.\nBut Graham isn’t alone.\n“The president has this uncanny ability to bend people to his sensible way of thinking,” US envoy Steve Witkoff told Sean Hannity last night.\n“He does it each and every time,” he said. “I've never seen anything quite like it and I've been around some master dealmakers. He is the legend as far as I'm concerned. His policy prescriptions are so pragmatic and so sensible and in a distorted world, he’s recalibrating it all. It’s simply remarkable. And every single leader that I have met in my travels, they say the same things I do. Every single one of them.”\nWitkoff is the envoy who Anne Applebaum said was “an amateur out of his depth” who “misunderstood his last meeting with Putin in Moscow if he thought that the Alaska summit was going to be successful.”\nOn Fox, noted international relations expert Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke said: “President Trump has done an unbelievable job against long odds,” before speculating, oddly, that “it'll end up probably with a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula and Russia.” He also said that Trump “hasn’t changed where his mission focus is. It’s peace.”\nPeace through surrender.\nIsn’t that the most striking thing? The US is unrivaled in its military and diplomatic might. We could end this war, now. As Applebaum said, “arm Ukraine, expand sanctions, stop the lethal drone swarms, break the Russian economy, and win the war. Then there will be peace.”\nBut Trump chooses weakness.\nHe chooses to look strong, not be strong.\nAnd no matter what his Republican allies in the Congress do to cover up that fact, they themselves cannot make him. They, too, are weak.\nLindsay Graham said the clock is ticking and that Trump must “impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports,” according to the AP, and such threats might push Putin to the negotiating table. “If we don’t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham told the AP Tuesday.\nPlan B would be Congress acting without Trump.\nWhich means there is no plan B.\nThe Republicans are weak, because they surrendered their power, first to the rightwing media apparatus, then to Trump, who surrendered his power to Putin, who dominates the rightwing media apparatus.\nAnd has for a decade.\nWe can speculate about the dirt Putin has on Donald Trump, but fact is, he could mortally wound the president by turning the world’s biggest firehose of disinformation away from his “woke” enemies and toward him. Trump’s base is already confused by his refusal to release “the Epstein files.” Russian propaganda could be deployed to savagely widen the already broad gap between him and the maga faithful.\nMore likely, though, the Kremlin could sow doubt about Trump’s alleged strength. He’s all talk, no walk. We saw it. Russian state media brags about it. Echoes are now bouncing around mainstream media.\nOn Tuesday, while Graham was shielding Trump from his weakness, the UK’s biggest conservative paper ran this hed and dek: “European rearmament is pushing Trump into irrelevance on Ukraine. This vain, vacillating, gullible US president no longer commands the West.”\nThe importance of the rightwing media apparatus to the Republicans is evident in their efforts at damage control. Trump showed his whole ass. Now it’s up to allies to persuade his supporters that they did not see what they saw or if they did, it was the most amazing thing ever.\nThey have a lot of work to do. The Economist reported that Americans have a -14 approval rating of his handling of foreign policy. The public knows next to nothing about global affairs, but we know what fear looks like. After meeting Putin, Trump looked scared. And I think he looked scared, because Putin reminded him of something important.\nHe who can destroy a thing controls it.\nSo Trump chooses weakness.\nAnd the rest of his party follows.\nNOW READ: Behind Trump's latest purge — and why MAGA's no longer pretending"

Ukraine-Russia war latest: Trump gives Putin another two-week deadline to agree meeting with Zelensky The US president said he will make a decision on how to approach peace talks ‘in two weeks’\nNo Putin-Zelensky meeting planned, says Russian foreign minister Lavrov\nOn The Ground newsletter: Get a weekly dispatch from our international correspondents Get a weekly dispatch from our international correspondents Get a weekly international news dispatch Donald Trump has suggested that he will give Vladimir Putin another two-week deadline to agree to peace talks with Volodymyr Zelensky .\nSpeaking to CNN, the US president said he will “know in two weeks what I’m going to do” after Moscow appeared to reject his plea for a meeting between the two leaders.\nEarlier this week, Trump said he would let Putin and Zelensky make their own plans to meet, followed by a trilateral summit. Zelensky has accused Moscow of “doing anything” to avoid a summit between the two countries.\nRussia ’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov cast doubt on the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky, saying an agenda was \"not ready at all\".\nIn his interview with CNN, Trump repeated his two-week timeframe several times - a deadline he previously gave to the Russian president to avoid US sanctions.\n“We’ll see what happens.

And this agenda is not ready at all,\" he said.\nThe statement echoed Moscow's established rhetoric about a leaders' meeting being impossible unless certain conditions were met.\nAsked for his response to Lavrov's comments and what the next steps are, Trump told reporters earlier on Friday: \"Well, we'll see. We're going to see if Putin and Zelenskiy will be working together.

And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,\" Putin said.\nThousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Russia launched in 2022. Analysts estimate that more than a million soldiers on both sides have been killed or wounded and fighting is continuing unabated, with both sides also attacking energy facilities.\nRussia has maintained its longstanding demand for Ukraine to give up land it still holds in two eastern regions while proposing to freeze the front line in two more southerly regions Moscow claims fully as its own and possibly hand back small pieces of other Ukrainian territory it controls.\nZelenskiy meanwhile has dropped his demand for a lengthy ceasefire as a prerequisite for a leaders' meeting, although he has previously said Ukraine cannot negotiate under the barrel of a gun.\nAt the press conference with Rutte, Zelenskiy said they had discussed security guarantees for Ukraine. He said the guarantees ought to be similar to NATO's Article 5, which considers an attack on one member of the alliance as an attack against all.\nRutte said NATO allies and Ukraine are working together to ensure security guarantees are strong enough that Russia will never try to attack again.\n\"Robust security guarantees will be essential, and this is what we are now working on to define,\" he said.\n( Source : Reuters )\nNext Story"

The Importance of Intelligence Sharing\nUkraine-Russia War Escalation: Trump Warns Putin with “Massive Sanctions” After Moscow Rejects Summit Proposal\nPutin’s Rejection and teh Shift in US Policy\nRecent developments in the Ukraine-Russia war have seen a significant escalation in tensions following Russia’s outright rejection of a proposed summit with Ukraine, brokered by international mediators. This move, widely condemned by Western allies, has prompted a strong response from former US President Donald Trump, who has publicly warned Vladimir Putin of impending “massive sanctions” should further aggression occur. This stance represents a notable shift from earlier periods of perceived reluctance regarding strong action against Russia.\nThe Sanctions Package: What We Know\nU.S. officials have reportedly prepared a comprehensive package of economic sanctions against Russia, ready for implementation upon Trump’s authorization. details emerging suggest the sanctions will target key sectors of the Russian economy, including:\nBanking Sector: Restrictions on major Russian banks’ access to international financial markets. This includes potential exclusion from SWIFT, the global messaging system for financial transactions.\nEnergy Sector: measures aimed at limiting Russia’s energy exports, a crucial source of revenue for the Kremlin. This could involve restrictions on technology transfer for oil and gas projects.\nDefense Industry: Expanded sanctions targeting Russian defense companies and individuals involved in arms sales and military procurement.\nTechnology Imports: Curtailing Russia’s access to critical technologies, including semiconductors and advanced manufacturing equipment.\nThese sanctions build upon existing measures already in place as the initial stages of the conflict in 2014 and the full-scale invasion in 2022. the potential impact on the Russian economy is considerable,with analysts predicting a further contraction in GDP and increased inflationary pressures.\nTrump’s Evolving Stance on Russia and Ukraine\nThroughout his presidency, Trump’s relationship with Russia and Ukraine was often characterized by ambiguity and controversy. While he consistently expressed a desire for improved relations with Putin, he also authorized military aid to Ukraine. However,reports from May 29,2025 (Reuters) indicated a degree of reluctance to impose further sanctions.\nThe current escalation, triggered by Moscow’s rejection of diplomatic overtures, appears to have solidified Trump’s position. His public warning signals a willingness to take a firmer stance against Russia, potentially driven by domestic political pressures and international condemnation. This change in tone is being closely watched by allies in Europe and NATO.\nInternational Response and Allied Alignment\nThe rejection of the summit proposal has drawn widespread criticism from the international community.\nEuropean Union: The EU has expressed strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and is expected to coordinate its sanctions policy with the US.\nNATO: The North Atlantic Treaty Institution has reaffirmed its commitment to collective defense and is increasing its military presence in Eastern Europe.\nUnited Kingdom: The UK has pledged continued military and financial assistance to Ukraine and is working with allies to impose further sanctions on Russia.\nThe level of allied alignment is crucial for the effectiveness of any sanctions regime. A united front will maximize pressure on Russia and minimize the potential for circumvention.\nImpact on Global Markets and Energy Security\nThe escalating conflict and the threat of further sanctions are already having a significant impact on global markets.\nEnergy Prices: Oil and gas prices have surged, driven by concerns about disruptions to Russian energy supplies. This is contributing to inflationary pressures worldwide.\nFood Security: Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of grain and fertilizers. The conflict is disrupting agricultural production and exports, raising concerns about food security in vulnerable countries.\nFinancial Markets: Global stock markets have experienced volatility, as investors react to the heightened geopolitical risks.\nThe long-term consequences of the conflict for global energy security and food supplies are potentially severe. Diversifying energy sources and strengthening global supply chains are becoming increasingly urgent priorities.\nPotential Scenarios and Future Outlook\nSeveral potential scenarios could unfold in the coming weeks and months:\n- Further Escalation: Russia could intensify its military offensive in Ukraine,potentially leading to a wider conflict.\n- Diplomatic Breakthrough: Despite the current impasse, there is still a possibility of a diplomatic breakthrough, leading to a ceasefire and negotiations.\n- Protracted Stalemate: The conflict could settle into a protracted stalemate, with ongoing fighting and limited territorial gains.\nThe outcome will depend on a complex interplay of factors, including the military situation on the ground, the political dynamics within Russia and Ukraine, and the actions of external actors. The threat of “massive sanctions” from Trump adds a new dimension to the equation, potentially influencing Putin’s calculations.\nUnderstanding the Role of SWIFT in Sanctions\nThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a critical component of international finance. Excluding Russian banks from SWIFT would severely hamper their ability to conduct international transactions, effectively isolating them from the global financial system. This has been a key demand from Ukraine and its allies, but its implementation carries risks, including potential disruptions to global trade and financial flows.\nThe Importance of Intelligence Sharing\nEffective sanctions require robust intelligence sharing between countries to identify and target individuals and entities involved in evading sanctions. This includes tracking illicit financial flows, identifying shell companies, and disrupting networks"

Speaking alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte in Kyiv, Zelensky said the fundamental issue was that Russia \"do not want to end the war\".\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reinforced this stance, stating that an agenda for potential Putin-Zelensky talks was \"not ready at all\". Despite Trump's diplomatic push, Lavrov confirmed that Moscow's core demands for any peace deal remained unchanged.\nTrump responded with a stark ultimatum, warning he would decide within two weeks whether to \"impose massive sanctions\" against Russia. When asked about potential inaction if Putin refuses negotiations, Trump said he would \"wait and see whose fault it is\" before making his next move.\nThe US President said: \"I think in two weeks, we'll know which way I'm going.\" Trump's frustration became evident as he described Putin and Zelensky as being \"like oil and vinegar\" in their relationship.\nAccording to The Guardian, Trump expressed particular anger over a Russian strike on an American factory in Ukraine that injured employees. This incident has reportedly heightened his resolve to pressure both sides toward negotiations.\nUkraine intensified its infrastructure targeting strategy, striking the Unecha oil pumping station on Russia's Druzhba pipeline. The attack threatens to halt Russian oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia for at least five days, creating new tensions within the European Union.\nHungarian and Slovak foreign ministers warned the European Commission that \"without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible\". The strike demonstrates Ukraine's strategy of targeting infrastructure supporting Moscow's war effort.\nPutin offered contrasting remarks, describing Trump as \"the light at the end of the tunnel\" for struggling US-Russia relations. Speaking at a nuclear research centre in Sarov, Putin said their Alaska meeting had been \"very good, meaningful and frank\".\nTrump displayed a photograph that Putin had sent him from their Alaska meeting, suggesting the Russian leader wanted to attend the 2026 World Cup in the United States. Trump said: \"He may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens.\"\nBritish aid worker Annie Lewis Marffy, 69, was killed in a Russian drone strike while delivering supplies to Ukraine. The Devon resident's body remains in an active combat zone, leaving her family in what aid organisations describe as \"red tape limbo\" due to bureaucratic challenges in issuing a death certificate.\nAccording to Daily Mail reports, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that Russian peace demands represent a \"trap\" designed to extract Ukrainian concessions while Russia makes none in return. Russian attacks on Kostiantynivka damaged 21 multi-storey buildings and civilian infrastructure, highlighting the continued escalation.\nSources used: \"PA Media\", \"The Independent\", \"The Guardian\", \"Daily Mail\" Note: This article has been edited with the help of Artificial Intelligence."
