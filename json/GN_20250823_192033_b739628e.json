      "text": "At Least 83% of Palestinians Killed in Israel’s Gaza Genocide Were Civilians: Israeli Military Data\nGaza (Quds News Network)- At least 83 percent of Palestinians killed in Israel’s genocide in Gaza were civilians, a new investigation has revealed, citing data from an internal Israeli intelligence database.\nThe investigation by +972 Magazine, Local Call, and the Guardian show that figures obtained from the classified database backs up the findings of several studies suggesting Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed civilians.\nThe Israeli military confirmed the existence of the database, which is managed by the Military Intelligence Directorate (known by the Hebrew acronym “Aman”).\nThe database includes a list of 47,653 names of Palestinians in Gaza whom Aman claims to be active in the military wings of Hamas and PIJ, according to sources.\nThe database designates 34,973 of the names as members of Hamas and 12,702 as members of Islamic Jihad. According to the data, which was obtained in May of this year, the Israeli military claimed it had killed around 8,900 resistance group members since October 7.\nThe overall death tolls published daily by the Palestinian Health Ministry (which Local Call revealed last year are considered reliable even by the Israeli military) do not distinguish between civilians and fighters. But taking the fighters casualty figures obtained from the internal Israeli military database in May and lining them up against the Health Ministry’s total death toll, it is possible to calculate an approximate civilian casualty ratio for the war up until three months ago, when the death toll stood at 53,000.\nAssuming that all of the certain and probable fighters were counted in the death toll, that would mean over 83 percent of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the assault were civilians. If the probable killings are discounted and only the certain deaths included, the proportion of civilian deaths rises to more than 86 percent.\nThe Israeli army’s international spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus, told CNN that Israel had killed two civilians for every one fighter — a ratio he described as “tremendously positive.” In May 2024, with the death toll at 35,000, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that the ratio was in fact closer to 1:1, a claim he repeated in September of the same year.\n+972 and Local Call recently revealed a case in which a battalion stationed in Rafah killed around 100 Palestinians and recorded them all as “terrorists,” yet an officer in the battalion testified that in all but two cases the victims had been unarmed.\n“We are reporting a lot of Hamas operatives killed, but I think most of the people we report as dead are not really Hamas operatives,” an intelligence source who accompanied forces on the ground told +972, Local Call, and the Guardian.\n“People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death. If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200 percent of Hamas operatives in the area.”\nPalestinian analyst Muhammad Shehada told +972, Local Call, and the Guardian that the numbers in the intelligence database line up closely with figures quoted to him by Hamas and PIJ officials: in December 2024, they estimated that Israel had killed around 6,500 of their members, including from the political wing.\nMaj. Gen. (res.) Itzhak Brik, who served for many years as a commander in the Israeli military, said, “They created a measure [whereby] the more you killed, the more you succeeded, and as a result they lied about how many they killed,” describing the numbers presented by the Israeli military Spokesperson as “one of the most serious bluffs” in Israel’s history.\n“They lie non-stop — both the military echelon and the political echelon,” Brik added. “In every raid, the IDF Spokesperson’s announcements said: ‘Hundreds of terrorists were killed,’” he continued. “It’s true that hundreds were killed, but they weren’t terrorists. There is absolutely no connection between the numbers they announce and what is actually happening.”\nWhile speaking to soldiers whose job was to examine and identify the bodies of people the army kills in Gaza, he said they told him: “Everyone the army says it killed, most of them are [civilians]. Period.”"

Two of these are the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda – among the worst crimes in the 20th Century.\nThe investigation led by +972 magazine analysed a secret Israeli intelligence database used to count militant deaths. The figures contradict official Israel claims by a “huge margin”. +972 says Israel usually claims a 1:1 or 2:1 margin of civilians deaths to combatant deaths:\nInstead, the classified data backs up the findings of several studies suggesting Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed civilians at a rate with few parallels in modern warfare.\nAuthoritative tally\n+972 said the Israeli military has confirmed the database exists. Insider sources have further confirmed Israeli authorities view the data as accurate:\nMultiple intelligence sources familiar with the database said the army views it as the only authoritative tally of militant casualty figures.\nOne source reportedly said: “There’s no other place to check.”\nReporting from 2023 revealed that the Israeli’s consider 100 civilians deaths an acceptable cost for the death of one senior Hamas commander, for example.\nUnusually high\nThe Uppsala Conflict Data Programme (UCDP) assesses civilian deaths from conflict. A UCDP assessment of the data suggests that 44,100 civilians were killed by Israel, while 8, 900 militant were killed.\nUCDP researcher Therese Pettersson told +972:\nThat proportion of civilians among those killed would be unusually high, particularly as it has been going on for such a long time.\nShe added that it is possible to find similar civilian casualty ratios when singling out a particular city or battle within a broader conflict, but “very rarely” when looking at a war as a whole.\nPettersson said:\nIn global conflicts tracked by UCDP since 1989, civilians made up a greater proportion of the dead only in the genocides in Srebrenica (1992-95) and Rwanda (1994) and during Russia’s three-month siege of Mariupol (2022)…\nMeanwhile, an expert body has declared famine in Gaza City – just as Israeli military is preparing from a new offensive there.\nIsrael’s famine in Gaza City\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is a world-leading authority on food crisis. On Friday, the IPC declared Gaza City was in a state of famine. Numerous agencies have warned that famine was coming in recent months. Some argue Israel is deliberately pushing Gaza into famine.\nIsrael is currently preparing a big military operation to take and hold Gaza City.\nAccording to Associated Press, the IPC requires three specific conditions are met to declare a famine:\nAt least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they’re too thin for their height. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nIsraeli-imposed restrictions make accurate reporting extremely difficult. But the IPC believes the conditions have been met:\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nAs expected, the Israeli government says famine claims are Hamas propaganda.\nFeatured image via the Canary"

      "text": "There’s a shocking new report on civilian deaths in Gaza. If only it were accurate.\nWhy bombshell claims may not tell the whole story about military versus civilian deaths\nWhen it comes to Gaza, the dead are a battlefield.\nThat’s what I took away from a bombshell joint investigation between The Guardian and +972 Magazine that dropped Thursday, beneath the headline, “Revealed: Israeli military’s own data indicates civilian death rate of 83% in Gaza war.”\nIt’s a shocking number — if it’s accurate. There is no normal standard for civilian deaths in war, especially the type of close-quarter urban war Israel has been fighting in Gaza since the Hamas attack of Oct. 7, 2023. But international humanitarian law requires armies to minimize civilian harm, something Israel has repeatedly claimed it is doing.\nIf the headlines are true, they will be claimed as a victory by the vocal anti-Israel camp. An 83% civilian death rate would put Israel’s Gaza incursion in miserable company among modern conflicts, just below the 1994 Rwandan massacre (99.4%), Russia’s 2022 decimation of Mariupol (95%) and the Serbian slaughter in Srebrenica in the early 1990s, whose civilian death rate was 92%. On the other hand, if the headlines are deceptive — unjustly accusing the Jewish state of a wanton level of human destruction far out of proportion to normal combat — pro-Israel voices will point to them as yet more evidence that the world is intolerably biased against the Jewish state.\nSo is the claim accurate? That’s highly questionable. And in the confusion lies one of the many sad facts of this conflict: Misleading, oversimplified headlines are further deepening societal divides.\nThe IDF’s own database lists the names of 8,900 Hamas fighters it has killed in the course of war — the central fact in the new investigation. From that number, the authors conclude that out of the 53,000 Gazans who, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, had been killed as of May, the remaining 44,100 souls must all have been innocent civilians.\nBut the IDF is not claiming those 8,900 fighters are the only fighters it’s killed. Nor is it logical to assume that the IDF has the names of every possible member of Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, or other militant groups in Gaza — or that none of the dead were worthy military targets, whether they were in Hamas uniform or not.\nHow do I know that? Because +972 Magazine says so — very far down in its story. Citing an Israeli intelligence source, it says the IDF’s database does not include people “who were killed but could not be identified by name, Gazans who took part in fighting but were not officially members of Hamas or PIJ, nor political figures in Hamas such as mayors and government ministers whom Israel also considers legitimate targets (in violation of international law).”\nIn other words, there may be many more legitimate non-civilian deaths, perhaps closer to the 17,000-20,000 that Israel has claimed.\nThat’s why, when I read The Guardian’s headline a second time, one word jumped out: indicates. The data doesn’t prove anything. It merely points to a possibility.\nOf course, there could conceivably also be more civilian deaths. A review of casualty numbers by the medical journal The Lancet in January said that the death toll might be as much as 40% higher than the estimate provided by the Health Ministry. And most parties agree that many bodies remain buried under Gaza’s rubble.\nAdditionally, it may come to light that many of the dead whom Israel claimed were fighters were, in fact, not. During an investigation into the killing of civilians at aid sites in Gaza last June, a senior IDF reserve officer told Haaretz, “We are constantly told there are no noncombatants in Gaza.”\nFor its part, Hamas does not separate civilian deaths from combat deaths — a chilling reminder of what Yahya Sinwar, the late Hamas commander who led the Oct. 7 massacre, meant when he told operatives that civilian deaths were “necessary sacrifices.”\nIt’s also a reminder that neither Hamas nor the IDF are particularly reliable narrators when it comes to the facts of this conflict. To take one example, the IDF, which has not released information on how it arrived at its casualty figures, claimed in January 2025 that Hamas had up to 25,000 fighters in Gaza — the same number it said Hamas had at the start of the war. “The numbers do not come close to adding up,” wrote The Jerusalem Post.\nThe IDF has since addressed the discrepancy by claiming its initial estimate was wrong — by 100%. Sure.\nSo here’s the real truth: We don’t know the actual facts yet. And while we wait for them, consider this:\nThe horrors stacking up in Gaza predispose some people to believe the worst. And there are horrors. Ehud Olmert, Israel’s former prime minister, said his own government may be committing war crimes. When this war stops, and journalists and medical specialists enter the strip, the numbers of dead and wounded, and the human stories of pain and loss behind them, will force a moral reckoning on those uncritical of how the Israeli government has conducted the war — and those who lionize Hamas’ violent “resistance,” which started it.\nAnd let’s be clear, there are Israel supporters and apologists for whom there is no red line, no number of civilian casualties they couldn’t accept or explain. Some of them, as they themselves have made clear, sit in the prime minister’s cabinet.\nBut there are also Israel critics for whom facts simply do not matter. The historian Ilan Pappe, for example, accused Israel of genocide in Gaza in 2010, when the strip’s population was 1.5 million. It is now 2 million, with a population growth rate, at least until the war, of 2.5 times the international average. The intellectual hollowness of these critics does the truth no favor. The worse the headline, the more credence they give it.\nSomeone who cares about the lives of innocents on both sides, and who believes that both must one day find a way to thrive together on the same patch of earth, honors the dead not by manipulating their numbers, but rather by working to bring all the killing to an end."

      "text": "The Netanyahu regime’s own classified data exposes a horrifying truth: five out of six Palestinians killed in Gaza are civilians, a genocidal death toll that shames Israel and demands global condemnation.\nThis damning evidence, uncovered in a joint investigation, unmasks the evil of Israel’s war machine, now grinding through its 19th month of relentless carnage.\nWhy it matters: The staggering civilian slaughter—83% of the dead—lays bare Israel’s defiance of international law, committing what scholars, activists, and even Israeli critics call genocide. This bloodbath, fueled by the Netanyahu government’s barbaric policies, devastates Gaza’s 2.3 million people, fuels starvation, and obliterates hope, while the world’s silence implicates us all.\nDriving the news: A classified Israeli military database, pried open by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call, reveals only 8,900 named Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters were killed by May 2025, against Gaza’s health ministry count of 53,000 total deaths. This 83% civilian kill rate is a moral atrocity, dwarfing even the horrors of Syria’s civil war or Russia’s siege of Mariupol. Netanyahu’s propagandists falsely claim 20,000 militants dead or a 1:1 civilian-to-combatant ratio, but their own data betrays them, exposing a campaign that brands dead civilians as “terrorists” to justify the massacre.\n- The database, built from seized Hamas and PIJ documents, lists 47,653 active militants, with nearly 40,000 still alive, showing Israel’s war hasn’t dented resistance but excels at civilian slaughter.\n- Gaza’s health ministry toll, trusted even by Israeli intelligence, likely undercounts the dead, ignoring thousands buried under rubble from Israel’s indiscriminate bombings.\n- Since May, Israel’s bloodlust has intensified, with hundreds killed at food distribution sites and a new ground assault looming in northern Gaza, promising more civilian agony.\nCatch up quick: Sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack killing 1,200 Israelis, Netanyahu’s genocidal response has razed Gaza, displaced over 90% of its people, and pushed the death toll past 62,000 by August 2025. Starvation, disease, and ruin define Israel’s legacy, a deliberate campaign to erase Palestinian life under the guise of “self-defense.”\nThe intrigue: Despite slaughtering tens of thousands, Israel’s own data shows nearly 40,000 militants remain active, proving Netanyahu’s war is a futile, sadistic exercise in civilian extermination, not a fight against Hamas. This chilling reality suggests Israel’s true aim is ethnic cleansing and territorial domination.\nBetween the lines: Israel’s AI-driven targeting, greenlighting strikes on low-level fighters with zero regard for civilian lives, fuels this genocide, as earlier exposés confirm. Netanyahu’s henchmen, spewing vile rhetoric about killing 50 Palestinians for every Israeli death, reveal a deliberate policy of mass murder, not collateral damage. This mirrors the “new wars” of Sudan and Yemen, where civilians are the target, and Israel’s evasive denials of its own data scream guilt in the face of global outrage.\nWhat they’re saying:\n- “Yesterday, Netanyahu said there was almost a 1-1 ratio of hamas to civillian kill ratio on the Triggernometry pod… Within 48 hours Netanyahu was debunked with his own nation’s stats. All Israel does is lie,” said Myron Gaines, in a post amplifying the report.\n- “That proportion of civilians among those killed would be unusually high, particularly as it has been going on for such a long time,” Therése Pettersson of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program told The Guardian, underscoring the depravity of Israel’s kill ratio.\n- “There is absolutely no connection between the numbers that are announced and what is actually happening. It is just one big bluff,” Itzhak Brik, a retired Israeli general who advised Netanyahu, confirmed soldiers know most victims are innocent civilians.\n- An IDF spokesperson lamely called the data “incorrect” without proof, a cowardly dodge reported by The Guardian, as Netanyahu’s regime scrambles to hide its crimes.\nThe bottom line: Israel’s own numbers confirm a genocide, strengthening cases at international courts and demanding the world—especially the US—cut ties with Netanyahu’s evil regime. As Israel prepares to unleash more death in Gaza City, we stand against this monstrous government, urging immediate ceasefires and justice to stop the annihilation of a people."

The statement also claimed the data does “not reflect the data available in the [Israeli military’s] systems”, without explaining what those systems contained.\nIsraeli politicians and military leaders have long inflated fighter death tolls, at times claiming as many as 20,000 fighters killed or insisting on a civilian-to-combatant ratio of 1:1 – figures that the report notes they do not believe in private.\nMeanwhile, Israeli rhetoric has increasingly mirrored genocidal language.\nIn leaked audio recordings aired on Israel’s Channel 12, Aharon Haliva, the former head of military intelligence, claimed, “The fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations.”\nHe went further, saying: “For each [victim] on 7 October, 50 Palestinians have to die … There’s no choice, they need a Nakba every now and then to feel the consequences.” The Nakba, or “catastrophe”, refers to the killing and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948 to make way for the creation of Israel.\nBy March, Gaza’s death toll had reached 50,000; it has since risen to beyond 62,000, according to the enclave’s health ministry. The total number of wounded has now exceeded 157,000.\nThe International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed between October 2023 and May 2024."

      "text": "LONDON: As many as 83 percent of Palestinian casualties in Gaza could be civilians, classified Israeli data suggests.\nA joint investigation by The Guardian, Hebrew-language Local Call and the Israeli-Palestinian +972 Magazine found that Israeli officials had been able to name 8,900 people killed or “probably dead” in Gaza as members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad as of May this year.\nAt the time, the total death toll from the war was believed to be at least 53,000 people according to local authorities, meaning that just 17 percent of those identified were combatants.\nThe database used to assess combatant casualty figures is based on documents seized by the Israeli military in Gaza.\nIn total, 47,653 Palestinians are identified as being members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad, meaning that a little under 40,000 are believed to be still alive\nThe Israeli military also believes Gaza’s health authorities’ data on casualties to be reliable, Local Call reported, though these figures are likely to be an underestimate as thousands of people remain buried under rubble, and only bodies positively identified are counted.\nTherese Pettersson of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program told The Guardian: “That proportion of civilians among those killed would be unusually high, particularly as it has been going on for such a long time.\n“If you single out a particular city or battle in another conflict, you could find similar rates, but very rarely overall.”\nShe added that since 1989, UCDP had only identified the siege of Srebrenica, the Rwandan genocide and the 2022 siege of Mariupol as conflicts that saw civilian casualties outnumber combatants.\nPreviously, Israeli politicians have cited a far more balanced casualty rate, with some suggesting it could even be equal between combatants and civilians. Others have suggested in the past that 20,000 people killed in Gaza were militants.\nThis could be on account of collating members of the enclave’s civilian infrastructure or people with loose ties to fighters — such as police and politicians — with membership of militant groups, but it is also believed that civilians without ties to Islamic Jihad or Hamas are included in those tallies.\nOne source who spent time with the Israeli military in Gaza told The Guardian that “people are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death,” adding: “If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200 percent of Hamas operatives in the area.”\nRetired Gen. Itzhak Brik, a former commander of Israel’s military colleges, told The Guardian that he had been told by former colleagues the numbers were inflated.\n“There is absolutely no connection between the numbers that are announced and what is actually happening,” he said. “It is just one big bluff.”\nPalestinian analyst Muhammad Shehada told the newspaper that by last December, the number of dead Hamas and Islamic Jihad members from their own data was around 6,500.\n“Israel expands the boundaries so they can define every single person in Gaza as Hamas,” he said. “All of it is killing in the moment for tactical purposes that have nothing to do with extinguishing a threat.”\nMoreover, the number of dead, and the disparity between civilian and combatant deaths, may have increased since May, with hunger now believed to be widespread due to a lack of food in Gaza, and an increase in the number of civilian deaths at aid distribution sites in the enclave.\nThe impending Israeli ground offensive in the north of Gaza will likely further widen this gap. So far, in excess of 62,000 people are believed to have been killed in the enclave.\nMary Kaldor, professor of global governance at the London School of Economics, said the nature of the Gaza conflict is also causing a disproportionate number of civilian casualties.\n“In Gaza we are talking about a campaign of targeted assassinations, really, rather than battles, and they are carried out with no concern for civilians,” she added.\nComparing Gaza to recent conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Sudan, she said: “These are wars where the armed groups tend to avoid battle. They don’t want to fight each other, they want to control territory and they do that by killing civilians.\n“Maybe that is the same with Israel, and this is a model of war (in Gaza) that is about dominating a population and controlling land. Maybe the objective always was forced displacement.”\nNeta Crawford, professor of international relations at Oxford University, said tactics used by Israel mark a “worrisome” departure from previously established norms to protect civilians.\n“They say they’re using the same kinds of procedures for civilian casualty estimation and mitigation as states like the United States. But if you look at these casualty rates, and their practices with the bombing and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, it is clear that they are not,” she said.\nIn a statement to The Guardian, the Israeli military said the figures published in the investigation “are incorrect.”"

      "text": "An investigation published Thursday belied Israeli government claims of a historically low civilian-to-combatant kill ratio in Gaza, as classified Israel Defense Forces intelligence data revealed that 5 in 6 Palestinians killed by the IDF through the first 19 months of the US-backed war were, in fact, civilians.\nA joint investigation by Israeli journalist and filmmaker Yuval Abraham of +972 Magazine and Local Call and Guardian senior international affairs correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison revealed that, as of May, the Military Intelligence Directorate identified by name 8,900 fighters from Hamas—which led the October 7, 2023 attack—and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as \"dead\" or \"probably dead.\"\nAt that time, the official Palestinian death toll in Gaza stood at 52,928, with the Gaza Health Ministry not differentiating between civilians and militants. Israeli officials and independent peer-reviewed studies have either concurred with the ministry's figures or called them an undercount.\nThe classified IDF data obtained by Abraham and Graham-Harrison show that at least 83% of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces through May were civilians, what Graham-Harrison called \"an extreme rate of slaughter rarely matched in recent decades of warfare... even compared with conflicts notorious for indiscriminate killing, including the Syrian and Sudanese civil wars.\"\nAccording to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program at Uppsala University in Sweden, the 83% civilian kill rate in Gaza is far higher than in Bosnia in 1992-95 (57%), the Syrian civil war of 2012-24 (29-34%), the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine (10-22%), or the US-led war in Afghanistan of 2001-21 (8-12%).\nOne unnamed intelligence source who was in Gaza told Abraham and Graham-Harrison: \"People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death. If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200% of Hamas operatives in the area.\"\nIn one case, +972 Magazine and Local Call revealed how one IDF battalion stationed in Rafah killed around 100 Palestinians and labeled them all as \"terrorists.\" However, an officer from the unit later testified that all but two of the victims were unarmed.\nThe new investigation adds to the body of research showing that Israel's assault and siege on Gaza—which is the subject of an ongoing International Court of Justice (ICJ) genocide case filed by South Africa—has, as Abraham put it, \"killed civilians at a rate with few parallels in modern warfare.\"\nThese studies destroy claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder and forced starvation—and members of his government of historically low civilian death rates in Gaza.\n\"Israel is setting the new gold standard for urban warfare with what appears to be the lowest civilian-to-combatant casualty ratio in history,\" Israeli government spokesperson Avi Hyman claimed in May 2024.\nIsrael's supporters around the world have parroted this false claim. John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the US Military Academy at West Point, said in January that \"Israel's civilian-to-combatant ratio is still historically low,\" and that \"Israel has done more and implemented more measures to prevent civilian harm than any military in the history of urban warfare.\"\nHowever, the facts show a very different reality. Retired IDF Gen. Itzhak Brik told Abraham and Graham-Harrison that \"there is absolutely no connection between the numbers that are announced and what is actually happening. It is just one big bluff.\"\n\"They lie non-stop—both the military echelon and the political echelon,\" Brik said. \"In every raid, the IDF spokesperson's announcements said: 'Hundreds of terrorists were killed.' It's true that hundreds were killed, but they weren't terrorists.\"\nFollowing the October 7 attack, the IDF dramatically loosened its rules of engagement, effectively allowing an unlimited number of civilians to be killed when targeting a single Hamas member, no matter how low-ranking. Numerous massacres ensued, including the October 31, 2023 killing of more than 120 civilians in a single IDF bombing targeting one Hamas member in the Jabalia refugee camp.\nThe IDF's use of massive ordnance, including US-supplied 1,000- and 2,000-pound \"bunker buster\" bombs capable of leveling entire city blocks,w and utilization of artificial intelligence to select targets has resulted in staggering numbers of civilian deaths. United Nations human rights officials have said that Israel's use of 2,000-pound bombs likely violates international law by deliberately targeting civilians in disproportionate attacks.\nThe indiscriminate slaughter is also taking place on the ground, where volunteer American surgeons have described treating—or sending to morgues—young children who appeared to be deliberately shot in the chest and head by IDF snipers. More recently, IDF whistleblowers said they were ordered to shoot or launch artillery shells into crowds of starving Palestinian civilians at aid distribution points run by the US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\nResponding to the new investigation, the IDF confirmed the existence of the Military Intelligence Directorate database, but claimed that \"figures presented in the article are incorrect,\" without further explanation.\nHowever, in a recording published last week, Aharon Haliva—a former IDF general who was in charge of intelligence operations on and after the October 7 attack—is heard approvingly accepting the official Gaza Health Ministry death toll at the time.\n\"The fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations,\" Haliva said. \"It doesn't matter now if they are children.\"\nSimilar statements by Israeli officials are a key component of South Africa's ICJ case, where applicants must prove intent to commit genocide under Article II of the Genocide Convention.\nThe most recent Gaza Health Ministry figures show that Israel's 685-day assault and siege on Gaza have left at least 62,122 Palestinians dead—most of them women and children—and more than 156,700 others wounded, with thousands more missing and presumed dead and buried beneath rubble. At least 271 Palestinians, including 112 children, have starved to death.\nThe dire situation for civilians in Gaza could be about to deteriorate even further as Israel intensifies Operation Gideon's Chariots II, which aims to conquer, occupy, and ethnically cleanse Palestinians in numbers exceeding even the Nakba, or \"catastrophe,\" during which more than 750,000 Arabs were forcibly expelled, sometimes via massacre and death march, during the establishment of Israel in 1948.\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly indicated that they would approve of such an annihilation, with Haliva asserted that Palestinians \"need a Nakba every now and then to feel the price\" of resisting more than a century of dispossession and displacement."

They added that the numbers “do not reflect the data available” in the military’s “systems”.\nThe military did not respond to why it gave different responses to different publications about the same data.\nThe data named 47,653 Palestinians who Israeli intelligence officials considered to be active members of the armed wings of Hamas and PIJ. The information is based on alleged internal documents seized from these groups in Gaza, not seen or verified by the Guardian, +972 Magazine or Local Call.\nIt lists 34,973 names of Hamas operatives, and 12,702 PIJ operatives.\nOf the 8,900 killed figure, it considered 7,330 to be certain, while 1,570 were “probably dead”.\nThe majority of these names were junior figures, while between 100-300 senior operatives were suspected of being killed, from a total of 750 senior names in the dataset.\nCivilian death toll higher\nLocal Call has previously reported that the Israeli military considers the death toll from the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza to be reliable. A former head of military intelligence appeared to cite the toll recently.\nThe investigation notes that the percentage of civilian deaths may in fact be higher.\n'People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death'\n- Israeli intelligence source\nThis is partly due to the fact that the health ministry death toll likely underestimates the number of those killed by attacks, as it does not include thousands buried under the rubble.\nIn addition, it is probable that Israeli intelligence officials may have included civilians with alleged connections to Hamas in their figures for combatants. This includes police officers or people involved in administrative positions in Gaza - who under international law are considered non-combatants.\nIsraeli officials may also have included Palestinians with no Hamas or PIJ connection at all, the report stated.\nOne example given is that Israel’s southern command allows soldiers to report deaths as militant casualties with no verification.\n“People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death,” one intelligence source who accompanied Israeli forces on the ground said.\n“If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200 percent of Hamas operatives in the area.”\nIn addition, the ratio of civilian deaths is likely to have increased since the May figures, given that was the month that the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operating in place of international aid groups.\nClose to 2,000 Palestinians have been killed while waiting to collect aid since then, according to Gaza health officials.\nThe 83 percent rate of civilian death is extremely high for modern warfare, the report states, even compared to conflicts in which indiscriminate killings took place such as recent civil wars in Syria and Sudan.\nAccording to research by the Guardian, using information from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program since 1989, only the genocide in Srebrenica, the Rwandan genocide and the Russian siege of Mariupol in Ukraine saw higher proportions of civilian deaths.\nLeading human rights organisations have reached the conclusion that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\nIn December 2024, Amnesty International became the first major organisation to conclude that Israel had committed genocide during its war on Gaza, followed by New York-based Human Rights Watch and Israel's B'Tselem.\nFrancesca Albanese, the UN's top expert on Palestine, authored two reports last year suggesting that genocide was taking place in Gaza.\nLast month, renowned professor of Holocaust and genocide studies Omer Bartov called Israel's war on Gaza an \"inescapable\" case of genocide, joining a chorus of prominent Israeli and Jewish scholars coming to the same conclusion.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

      "text": "Data from an internal Israeli intelligence database indicates that at least 83 percent of Palestinians killed in Israel’s onslaught on Gaza were civilians, an investigation by +972 Magazine, Local Call, and the Guardian can reveal.\nFigures obtained from the classified database — which records the deaths of militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) — contradict by a huge margin the public statements of Israeli army and government officials throughout the war, which have generally claimed a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio of civilian to militant casualties. Instead, the classified data backs up the findings of several studies suggesting Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed civilians at a rate with few parallels in modern warfare.\nThe Israeli army confirmed the existence of the database, which is managed by the Military Intelligence Directorate (known by the Hebrew acronym “Aman”). Multiple intelligence sources familiar with the database said the army views it as the only authoritative tally of militant casualty figures. In the words of one of them: “There’s no other place to check.”\nThe database includes a list of 47,653 names of Palestinians in Gaza whom Aman considers to be active in the military wings of Hamas and PIJ; according to the sources, the list is based on the groups’ own internal documents acquired by the army (which +972, Local Call, and the Guardian were unable to verify). The database designates 34,973 of the names as operatives of Hamas and 12,702 as operatives of Islamic Jihad (a small number are listed as active with both groups, but these are counted only once in the overall total).\nAccording to the data, which was obtained in May of this year, the Israeli army believed it had killed around 8,900 operatives since October 7 — the deaths of 7,330 of whom were considered certain and 1,570 recorded as “probably dead.” The vast majority of them were junior, with the army suspecting it had killed 100-300 senior Hamas operatives out of a total of 750 named in the database.\nA source familiar with the database explained that a specific piece of intelligence is attached to the name of every operative on the list whom the army is sure it killed, justifying that designation. +972, Local Call, and the Guardian obtained the numerical data from the database without the names or additional intelligence reports.\nThe overall death tolls published daily by the Gaza Health Ministry (which Local Call revealed last year are considered reliable even by the Israeli military) do not distinguish between civilians and militants. But taking the militant casualty figures obtained from the internal Israeli army database in May and lining them up against the Health Ministry’s total death toll, it is possible to calculate an approximate civilian casualty ratio for the war up until three months ago, when the death toll stood at 53,000.\nAssuming that all of the certain and probable militant deaths were counted in the death toll, that would mean over 83 percent of Gaza’s dead were civilians. If the probable deaths are discounted and only the certain deaths included, the proportion of civilian deaths rises to more than 86 percent.\nThe intelligence sources explained that the total number of militants killed is likely higher than the number recorded in the internal database, since it does not include Hamas or PIJ operatives who were killed but could not be identified by name, Gazans who took part in fighting but were not officially members of Hamas or PIJ, nor political figures in Hamas such as mayors and government ministers whom Israel also considers legitimate targets (in violation of international law).\nHowever, that does not necessarily mean the ratio of civilian casualties is lower than calculated above; in fact, it could be even higher. Recent studies have suggested the Health Ministry’s death toll — which currently stands at around 62,000 — is also likely a significant undercount of the total number of casualties from Israel’s onslaught, possibly by as many as several tens of thousands.\nFudging the numbers\nSince early on in the war, Israeli officials have sought to dismiss accusations of wanton killing in Gaza as the Palestinian death toll rapidly stacked up. In December 2023, with the death toll already at 16,000, the Israeli army’s international spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus, told CNN that Israel had killed two civilians for every one militant — a ratio he described as “tremendously positive.” In May 2024, with the death toll at 35,000, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted that the ratio was in fact closer to 1:1, a claim he repeated in September of the same year.\nThe specific number of militants Israel claims to have killed since October 7 has fluctuated seemingly without any logic. In November 2023, a senior security official implied to Israel’s Ynet news site that Israel had already killed over 10,000 militants. In an official military assessment presented to the government the following month, this number dropped to 7,860.\nMysterious jumps and drops in militant casualty numbers continued into 2024. In February of that year, the IDF Spokesperson claimed that Israel had killed 13,000 Hamas operatives, but a week later, the army reported a lower figure of 12,000. By August 2024, the army declared that it had killed 17,000 Hamas and PIJ operatives — a number that shrank again two months later to 14,000 killed “with high probability.” In November 2024, Netanyahu put the number “close to 20,000.”\nIn his retirement speech in January of this year, outgoing Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi reiterated that Israel had killed 20,000 militants in Gaza since October 7. And in June, the right-wing Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University cited military sources claiming that the number of militant casualties in Gaza stood at 23,000.\nIntelligence sources told +972, Local Call, and the Guardian that some of these claims likely arose from an older, inaccurate database maintained by the army’s Southern Command which estimated late last year — without a list of names — that around 17,000 militants had been killed. “Those numbers are tall tales of the Southern Command,” one intelligence source said.\nThe Southern Command’s exaggerated reports were likely based on statements from commanders in the field whose subordinates regularly misreported civilian casualties as militants.\nFor example, +972 and Local Call recently revealed a case in which a battalion stationed in Rafah killed around 100 Palestinians and recorded them all as “terrorists,” yet an officer in the battalion testified that in all but two cases the victims had been unarmed. An investigation by Haaretz last year similarly found that only 10 out of 200 “terrorists” the IDF Spokesperson stated that the 252nd Division had killed in the Netzarim Corridor could be verified as Hamas operatives.\nIn April 2024, the right-wing daily Israel Hayom reported that several members of the Knesset’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee had questioned the reliability of the militant casualty figures presented to them by the army. After examining the army’s own data, the committee members found that the real number was much lower, and that the army had inflated the number of militant casualties “in order to create a 2:1 ratio” between civilian and militant deaths.\n“We are reporting a lot of Hamas operatives killed, but I think most of the people we report as dead are not really Hamas operatives,” an intelligence source who accompanied forces on the ground told +972, Local Call, and the Guardian. “People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death. If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200 percent of Hamas operatives in the area.”\nAn official security source confirmed that before the intelligence database was in use, the army’s militant casualty figures — such as the number 17,000 — were just an “estimate” largely based on officer testimonies. “The method of counting changed,” the source said. “At the start of the war, [we relied] on commanders saying ‘I killed five terrorists.’”\nThe intelligence database, in contrast, is based on a person-by-person analysis and is the only number the army can “commit to” with a high degree of certainty, the source explained — even while assuming that it could be an undercount. The source added that the numbers political leaders say publicly are not coordinated with the available intelligence data.\nPalestinian analyst Muhammad Shehada told +972, Local Call, and the Guardian that the numbers in the intelligence database line up closely with figures quoted to him by Hamas and PIJ officials: in December 2024, they estimated that Israel had killed around 6,500 of their members, including from the political wing.\n‘They lie non-stop’\nSoon after October 7, Yossi Sariel, then-commander of the army’s elite signals intelligence squad, Unit 8200, began sharing a daily update with his subordinates showing the number of Hamas and PIJ operatives killed in Gaza. The graph, according to three sources familiar with it, was called the “war dashboard” and was presented by Sariel as a measure of the army’s success.\n“He put a lot of emphasis on ‘data, data, data,’” one of Sariel’s subordinates explained. “[There was a] need to measure everything in quantitative terms. To show efficiency. To try to make everything smarter and more technological.” Another source said it was like “a football game, officers sitting around watching the numbers go up on the dashboard.” (Yossi Sariel declined our request for comment, referring us to the IDF Spokesperson.)\nMaj.

Itzhak Brik, who served for many years as a commander in the Israeli army and later as Ombudsman for Soldiers’ Complaints, explained how this outlook fueled a culture of lying. “They created a measure [whereby] the more you killed, the more you succeeded, and as a result they lied about how many they killed,” he said, describing the numbers presented by the IDF Spokesperson as “one of the most serious bluffs” in Israel’s history.\n“They lie non-stop — both the military echelon and the political echelon,” Brik added. “In every raid, the IDF Spokesperson’s announcements said: ‘Hundreds of terrorists were killed,’” he continued. “It’s true that hundreds were killed, but they weren’t terrorists. There is absolutely no connection between the numbers they announce and what is actually happening.”\nWhile speaking to soldiers whose job was to examine and identify the bodies of people the army kills in Gaza, he said they told him: “Everyone the army says it killed, most of them are [civilians]. Period.”\nBoth Hamas and PIJ have been severely weakened by Israel’s offensive over the past two years, which has killed most of the groups’ senior command and significantly damaged their military infrastructure. Still, the data obtained from the intelligence database shows that Israel has killed only one-fifth of those it considers to be militants. American intelligence estimates suggest Hamas has recruited 15,000 operatives during the war — twice as many as Israel killed.\nBut widespread genocidal rhetoric from Israel’s leadership and senior military command since the very beginning of the war suggests an intention to harm all Palestinians in Gaza, not just militants. On the morning of October 7, then-Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi told his wife, “Gaza will be destroyed,” she revealed on a recent podcast. And in a leaked recording from recent months aired last week on Israel’s Channel 12, the then-director of Aman, Aharon Haliva, said “50 Palestinians must die” for every Israeli killed on October 7, adding, “it doesn’t matter now if they are children.”\nInternational law does not assert what constitutes an “acceptable” civilian casualty ratio, but rather examines each attack according to the principle of “proportionality.” In this regard, as early as November 2023, +972 and Local Call revealed that the Israeli army had significantly loosened restrictions on civilian casualties after October 7, authorizing the killing of more than 100 Palestinian civilians when attempting to assassinate one senior Hamas commander, and up to 20 for junior operatives.\nThe result of this firing policy and the broader culture of revenge following October 7 is a civilian casualty ratio in Gaza that is extremely high for modern warfare, experts say, even compared with conflicts notorious for indiscriminate killing such as the Syrian and Sudanese civil wars.\n“That proportion of civilians among those killed would be unusually high, particularly as it has been going on for such a long time,” said Therese Pettersson from the Uppsala Conflict Data Programme (UCDP), which collects data on civilian casualties worldwide. She added that it is possible to find similar civilian casualty ratios when singling out a particular city or battle within a broader conflict, but “very rarely” when looking at a war as a whole.\nIn global conflicts tracked by UCDP since 1989, civilians made up a greater proportion of the dead only in the genocides in Srebrenica (1992-95) and Rwanda (1994) and during Russia’s three-month siege of Mariupol (2022), Pettersson said.\nOnly when there is a ceasefire will it be possible to precisely calculate the number of civilian and militant casualties in Gaza. But the intelligence database indicates that the civilian casualty ratio is vastly higher than the figures Israel has presented to the world for almost two years.\nMost read on +972\n+972 and Local Call initially approached the IDF Spokesperson for comment at the end of July, and received a statement that did not dispute our findings: “Throughout the war, comprehensive intelligence assessments were conducted on the number of terrorists eliminated in the Gaza Strip. The count is a complex intelligence process that is based on the situation of the forces on the ground and intelligence information, while cross-referencing a wide range of intelligence sources.”\nThree weeks later, after the Guardian’s request for comment on the same data, the army said it wanted to “rephrase” its response and rejected our findings without further explanation: “The figures presented in the article are incorrect and do not reflect the data available in the IDF’s systems. Throughout the war, continuous intelligence assessments are conducted regarding the number of terrorists eliminated in the Gaza Strip, based on BDA [bomb damage assessment] methodologies and cross-checking efforts from various sources … [including] documents originating from terrorist organizations in the Strip.”\nA spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked why the military had given different responses to questions about a single set of data.\nEmma Graham-Harrison of the Guardian contributed to this report."

      "text": "Leaked IDF Intelligence Reveals ‘Extreme Rate of Slaughter’ of Gaza Civilians\nFigures leaked from a classified Israeli database revealed that the number of combatants confirmed to have been killed in Gaza is far lower than previously claimed.\nA joint investigation by the Guardian and Israeli-Palestinian outlet +972 Magazine found that the internal intelligence database used by the Israeli Defense Forces to record the deaths of militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) deemed 7,330 militants have been confirmed killed while 1,570 were recorded as “probably dead.”\nAccording to the +972 report, intelligence sources said the database is considered by the IDF to be “the only authoritative tally of militant casualty figures.”\nThe Gaza Health Ministry death toll numbers — which have been questioned publicly by Israel, but according to reports are are considered reliable by the IDF internally — do not differentiate between militant and civilian deaths. But by comparing both the health ministry numbers and the data obtained from the Israeli intelligence database, an approximate civilian casualty ratio for the war can be calculated.\nIf all deaths recorded in the internal database are the total for militant deaths, then more than 83 percent of deaths in Gaza have been non-combatant civilians. This number spikes even higher to 86 percent civilian death rate if you discount “probably dead” militants.\nThese figures sharply contradict previous statements made by army officials about the ratio of militant to civilian deaths.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed last year that the IDF has achieved the “lowest ratio of civilian to combatant deaths in the history of modern urban warfare.”\nMedia figures have also pushed the claim that the war in Gaza, launched by Israel in response to the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas that killed more than 1,200 people, most of them civilians, is being carried out in an exceedingly cautious way. Commentator Douglas Murray argued to Joe Rogan in April that “one innocent Gazan has been killed for every one terrorist.” Alan Dershowitz defended Israel’s actions in a recent opinion piece in part by claiming that “the ratio of civilian to combatant deaths, [which] is lower for Israel than for any army facing comparable enemies.”\nYet this new leaked Israeli intelligence yields a civilian death rate described in the report as “an extreme rate of slaughter rarely matched in recent decades of warfare.”\nIndeed, when compared to other conflicts, the civilian death rate would put Gaza above other particularly brutal campaigns — including conflicts in Aleppo, Bosnia, and Syria.\nIntelligence sources explained to +972 that the total number of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives killed would likely be higher than the Israeli intelligence data shows. This is due to the fact that the database itself does not include any operatives killed who could not be identified by name, nor does it record those in Gazans who took part in the fighting but were not officially members of either militant group.\nThat said, +972 points out that estimates of the true death toll in Gaza is considerably higher than the one reported by the health ministry. Studies, including one by The Lancet, have suggested the death toll in Gaza is considerably higher than the tally — which currently stands at more than 62,000 dead — provided by the health ministry."

When the\nasked for comment on the same data, a spokesperson said they had decided to “rephrase” their response.A brief statement sent to the\ndid not directly address questions about the military intelligence database.It said “figures presented in the article are incorrect”, without specifying which data the Israeli military disputed. It also said the numbers “do not reflect the data available in the IDF’s systems”, without detailing which systems.\nA spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked why the military had given different responses to questions about a single set of data.\nThe database names 47,653 Palestinians considered active in the military wings of Hamas and PIJ. It is based on apparent internal documents from the groups seized in Gaza, which have not been viewed or verified by the\n.Multiple intelligence sources familiar with the database said the military viewed it as the only authoritative tally of militant casualties.\nThe military also considers the Gaza health ministry toll reliable, Local Call has reported, and the former head of military intelligence appeared to cite it recently, even though Israeli politicians regularly dismiss the numbers as propaganda.\nBoth databases may underestimate casualty numbers. The Gaza ministry of health lists only people whose bodies have been recovered, not the thousands buried under rubble. Israeli military intelligence are not aware of all militant deaths or all new recruits. But the databases are the ones used by Israeli officers for war planning.\nIsraeli politicians and generals have variously put the number of militants killed as high as 20,000, or claimed a civilian-to-combatant ratio as low as 1:1.\nThe higher totals cited by Israeli officials may include civilians with Hamas links, such as government administrators and police, even though international law prohibits targeting people not engaged in combat.\nThey probably also include Palestinians with no Hamas connections. Israel’s southern command allowed soldiers to report people killed in Gaza as militant casualties without identification or verification.\n“People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death,” said one intelligence source who accompanied forces on the ground. “If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200% of Hamas operatives in the area.”\nItzhak Brik, a retired general, said serving Israeli soldiers were aware that politicians exaggerated the Hamas toll. Brik advised the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the war and is now among his most strident critics. “There is absolutely no connection between the numbers that are announced and what is actually happening. It is just one big bluff,” he said.\nBrik commanded Israel’s military colleges, and said he kept in touch with serving officers. He described meeting soldiers from a unit identifying Palestinians killed in Gaza, who told him “most of them” were civilians.\nEven though much of Gaza has been reduced to ruins and tens of thousands of people killed, the classified database lists nearly 40,000 people considered by the army to be militants and still alive.\nCasualty estimates from Hamas and PIJ members also indicated Israeli officials were inflating the militant toll in public statements, said Muhammad Shehada, a Palestinian analyst.\nBy December 2024 an estimated 6,500 people from the military and political wings of both groups had been killed, members told him. “Israel expands the boundaries so they can define every single person in Gaza as Hamas,” he said. “All of it is killing in the moment for tactical purposes that have nothing to do with extinguishing a threat.”\nThe ratio of civilian casualties among the dead may have increased further since May, when Israel tried to replace UN and humanitarian organisations that had fed Palestinians throughout the war. Israeli forces have killed hundreds of people trying to get food from distribution centres in military exclusion zones.\nNow starving survivors, already forced into just 20% of the territory, have been ordered to leave the north as Israel prepares for another ground operation that is likely to have catastrophic consequences for civilians.\nThe scale of the killing was partly owing to the nature of the conflict, said Mary Kaldor, professor emeritus at the LSE, director of the Conflict Research Programme and author of New Wars, an influential book about warfare in the post-cold-war era.\nInternational humanitarian law was developed to protect civilians in conventional wars, in which states deploy troops to face each other on the battlefield. This is still largely the model for Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nIn Gaza Israel is fighting Hamas militants in densely populated cities, and has set rules of engagement that allow its forces to kill large numbers of civilians in strikes on even low-ranking militants. “In Gaza we are talking about a campaign of targeted assassinations, really, rather than battles, and they are carried out with no concern for civilians,” Kaldor said.\nThe ratio of civilians among the dead in Gaza was more comparable to recent wars in Sudan, Yemen, Uganda and Syria, where much of the violence had been directed against civilians, she said. “These are wars where the armed groups tend to avoid battle. They don’t want to fight each other, they want to control territory and they do that by killing civilians,.\n“Maybe that is the same with Israel, and this is a model of war [in Gaza] that is about dominating a population and controlling land. Maybe the objective always was forced displacement.”\nIsrael’s government says the war is one of self-defence after the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people.\nBut political and military leaders regularly use genocidal rhetoric. The general who led military intelligence when the war began has said 50 Palestinians must die for every person killed that day, adding that “it does not matter now if they are children”. Aharon Haliva, who stepped down in April 2024, said mass killing in Gaza was “necessary” as a “message to future generations” of Palestinians, in recordings broadcast on Israeli TV this month.\nMany Israeli soldiers have testified that all Palestinians are treated as targets in Gaza. One stationed in Rafah this year said his unit had created an “imaginary line” in the sand and fired at anyone who crossed it, including twice at children and once at a woman. They shot to kill, not to warn, he said. “Nobody aimed for their legs”.\nNeta Crawford, a professor of international relations at Oxford University and co-founder of the Costs of War project, said Israeli tactics marked a “worrisome” abandonment of decades of practices developed to protect civilians.\nIn the 1970s public revulsion about American massacres in Vietnam forced western militaries to shift how they fought. New policies were imperfectly implemented but reflected a focus on limiting harm to civilians that no longer appeared to be part of Israel’s military calculus, she said.\n“They say they’re using the same kinds of procedures for civilian casualty estimation and mitigation as states like the United States. But if you look at these casualty rates, and their practices with the bombing and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, it is clear that they are not.”"

So AGAIN what is NZ doing to counteract or show their revulsion at the carnage and barbaric waste of life. Why the hell should Palestinians be forced to relocate because it’s what Israel wants? How much lower can Israel stoop – not much – so how about it Luxon/Peters, it’s way past time to show you both still have some decency left in you. Imagine if the above photo was the aftermath from say Auckland – how would we all feel or cope? Saying more were killed in other confrontations is never a good enough excuse. This is happening NOW.

      "text": "The real Gaza death toll is impossible to know today, but the minimum isn’t\nAugust 23, 2025\nNote: At the time of writing, a summary analysis similar to the one below was published in Current Affairs, attributed to “Lex Syd.” There are a few differences in our sources and analyses, but the numbers are the same.\nFor a year and a half, whether we’ve noticed it or not, people who look at international news have read variations on the following sentence many, many times: “The Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.” Its inclusion is so mindlessly automatic at this point that it keeps showing up in major media’s occasional articles on how many children the Israeli Defence Forces have killed, an obscene caveat suggesting that for all we know, most of these kids — even most of the pre-teenage kids — were justified targets.\nIt has made some sense to rely on the ministry’s count as a baseline death toll, since it only includes recovered bodies, most of them identified by name. This is why every country, UN organisation, international humanitarian organisation, and mainstream media outlet uses it — even Israeli intelligence agrees with its numbers. But given the shocking pace at which the death toll in Gaza has climbed, it has seemed to genocide skeptics to demand a qualifier. So, early on in the war on Gaza, the “does not distinguish” sentence became an editorial incantation allowing a measure of disbelief in the live streamed reality of the mass killing of civilians.\nThis obsession with ambiguity was at once very human — who wouldn’t prefer to see a reality where we weren’t complicit in a genocide? — and deeply inhuman, in its rote soft-pedalling of atrocities in which all Americans, as their primary suppliers and chief international supporters, have always been complicit. If the unbelievable numbers of unarmed people killed by one of our closest allies, with the active support of our own country — 5000 of them, and then very quickly 10,000, and 25,000, and then 30 and 40 and 60,000 people just like us and our families — if an indeterminate number of them were actually “combatants,” well, maybe this was only, as so many supporters of the campaign kept saying, the storm and fog of just another war. After all, the IDF had estimated, as the siege began, that there were some 30,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza. Maybe a 30%, or a 40%, or even a 50% civilian death rate, many people apparently thought, was just the price that had to be paid for the realisation of a fantasy that no one ever really believed was possible – the “eradication” of Hamas.\nWherever one has stood in relation to this open-ended spectrum of horror, the ministry numbers have seemed to be something everyone could pretty much agree on, at least inside of the fringes of the discourse on Gaza. Unless you were so rabid to keep the death machine rolling that your first instinct was to call the unspooling names of dead children “Hamas propaganda”, or you were so certain that we were being forced into complicity in a genocide that you obsessively recalculated and posted the most probable real death toll (as I’ve done every month since the war began), you went with the visible consensus: however many thousands, “according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants”.\nYet, virtually everyone who accepts that number also accepts that it must be an undercount of some significant but unknowable size. Since the Health Ministry only counts recovered bodies, every single unrecovered body is also uncounted. When we recall what the damage in Gaza looks like — massive bombs dropped on densely populated urban areas, generally with no actionable warning, usually with vague or expired location data and often without guidance systems anyway — it’s hard to avoid the question of how many people have died, quickly or in prolonged agony, whose bodies have never been recovered. Imagine for a moment that the greater New York metropolitan area were reduced to this, with virtually no-one allowed to leave as it happened, nowhere to shelter, and with further bombing of the areas to which any internal refugees relocated, and you can begin to imagine how many human beings were hit so hard that there was nothing left to recover or identify; how many more could never be recovered, brought in to be identified, or counted; how many bodies were buried either anonymously, in cemeteries since razed flat by the IDF, or in the mass graves it has dug; how many f amilies had no members left alive to report the dead.\nAs Arwa Mahdawi put it in _The Guardian_ last week, “We have no idea how many people have been killed in Gaza but I would bet my own life that the number is far higher than the 60,000 number the media uses.” That’s a very common thought in discussions of Gaza. There’s even a very occasional qualifier to the “does not distinguish” clause in major media coverage, noting that the ministry’s death toll is “ likely to be an undercount”.\nThe problem with leaving this sentiment at “we have no idea how many people have been killed” is that we do have a very clear idea of the minimum, based on the most rigorous, detailed analyses that statisticians, epidemiologists, trauma specialists, and experts on urban warfare, working together under stringent peer review in the world’s leading research forums, agree on. And that minimum number is indeed much higher than the ministry’s count.\nThat minimum scientifically plausible number of traumatic deaths only — immediate deaths from bullets, bombs, and demolished buildings — in the Gaza genocide is currently more than 115,000.\nThe minimum scientifically plausible number of deaths attributable to the genocide overall is more than 460,000.\nAnyone who claims to rely on the best scientific consensus today must report the current death toll in the Gaza genocide as “more than 115,000” violent deaths or “more than 460,000” overall.\nHere, in some detail, is why.\nThe Gaza Ministry of Health’s death toll as I write this has just passed 62,000 — I’ll refer to this number as “GMH,” so anyone can easily replicate this math at any point in the future. These are the steps, with citations, for understanding this number’s relationship to the current 115,000 to 460,000 range. In every step, I will use the most conservative plausible parameters of any uncertainly, ensuring that our minimum really is the minimum.\n1. The first adjustment that must be made to GMH is its likely undercount, due to the sheer chaos of the genocide. The definitive scientific study calculating this number was published in February 2025 by four of the world’s leading clinicians, epidemiologists, and experts in emergency medicine, in _The Lancet_ – a 200-year-old, rigorously peer-reviewed scientific journal and the world’s most prominent research publication in general medicine. The researchers, the research, and the venue here are unimpeachable, and its undercount results have since been confirmed almost exactly by a second major study using a completely different approach. The study found, with a 95% confidence interval, that the ministry undercounted the death toll from traumatic injury by 41%. This means that the ministry’s count at the time represented only 59% of actual deaths due to traumatic injury. It is almost certainly more of an undercount now, since reporting conditions have only deteriorated in the more than 13 months since the end of the period considered in the study – but we will stay with the minimum plausible number.\nFor this, we need to divide GMH / .59, for a minimum of 105,085 deaths by traumatic injury.\n2. The calculation of this undercount excludes those who are missing and presumed dead.\nA second adjustment must be made for the percentage of Gazans whose whereabouts are unknown but who are likely dead. That calculation has remained more or less set, by organisations including the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Lancet study, since at least May 2024, at about 10,000.\nIt is almost certainly much higher now: ever more buildings have been bombed and demolished, and no heavy equipment capable of digging out bodies has been allowed to operate. An indeterminate number of Gazans have been shipped to Israeli prison camps to be imprisoned without charges and frequently starved, beaten, and/or sexually or medically tortured. An unknown number of these people have also been killed, their bodies dumped on the ground back in Gaza to be identified or not, or buried or stored in Israeli territory, their names often unrecorded and rarely reported.\nBut again, we’ll go with the consensus minimum: 10,000.\nGMH / .59\n+10,000\nThe current minimum death toll in the Gaza genocide is now 115,085 — our overall minimum number for deaths by traumatic impact alone.\n3. This number does not include anyone killed in the genocide by any means other than traumatic violence leading more or less directly to death (though we can be sure that many thousands of those actually suffered in the worst imaginable pain and despair beneath the rubble, or in the street, or on a bombed-out hospital floor, for some time before dying).\nIf we want to include Gazans killed by other siege tactics — Israel’s strategic denial of food, water, medical supplies, power, and medicine — we must rely on data from previous bombing and siege campaigns with similar profiles. This is challenging, in part because the Gaza genocide is genocidal: because only a tiny fraction of Gazans have been allowed to leave Gaza, and because the IDF has ensured a civilian casualty rate that vastly exceeds that of comparable bombardments, and because no bombing campaign has been as proportionately destructive since or even before World War II, the scope of “excess mortality” compared to the death rate before October 2023 may be so large that there is nothing in the historical data to help us estimate a probable maximum.\nSo again, let’s set the minimum.\nThe Lancet followed up its initial study by publishing a letter from three other internationally respected doctors and epidemiologists pointing out that according to extensive studies of recent wars compiled by the UNHCR, the ratio of “indirect deaths” to direct deaths from traumatic impact ranged from 3:1 to 15:1. It’s worth emphasising once again that the bombing campaign in Gaza has been more destructive than any of the wars that yielded these ratios. Nonetheless, we will take the smallest recorded ratio of 3:1 – even less than the 4:1 ratio that the UNHCR study uses as its most “conservative” metric.\nGMH / .59\n+10,000\nx3\nThe minimum death toll in the Gaza genocide is now 463,220 — our minimum number of deaths directly attributable to the genocide.\nThese numbers, which represent the most conservative minimum that is scientifically plausible in each case, can now be used as a baseline for further calculations:\n+ Before October 2023, the population of the Gaza Strip was about 2.23 million. Direct deaths from the genocide have killed at least 5% of the population. Direct and indirect deaths from the genocide have killed at least 20% of the population.\n+ Given Israel’s own estimate that there were some 30,000 Hamas fighters in Gaza as of October 2023, of which it now says it has killed some 20,000 (it has provided no evidence for either figure), the civilian death rate it has inflicted through direct deaths is more than 83%. The overall civilian death rate it has inflicted in Gaza since October 2023 is at least 96%. Both percentages are well within the range the IDF has _explicitly_ _allowed_.\n+ Before October 2023, c hildren under 15 years old represented 44% of Gaza’s population. The Lancet study found 59% of direct deaths to be those of women, children, and the elderly—excluding military-age men. Basic demographics show that 66% of that 59% were children under 15. The direct death toll for children under 15 in this genocide is at least 45,221. The death toll for children under 15 including all deaths caused by the genocide is, at minimum, 135,664 – and almost certainly many more.\nThere will be no way to accurately count the dead in Gaza until the bombing ends. Even then, it will take years, at best. Nonetheless, we can bear better witness than the repetition of the baseline numbers tallied by the Gaza Ministry of Health; and we can bear far better witness than to recite, like a talisman, that it “does not distinguish between civilians and combatants\".\nWe can — we must — start acknowledging the bare minimum of what this genocide has already, indisputably wrought.\nRepublished from CounterPunch, 19 August 2025\nThe views expressed in this article may or may not reflect those of Pearls and Irritations."

This accounts for just 17 per cent of the total deaths, and thus 83 per cent of the rest are civilians.\nThe database shows that the apparent ratio of deaths of civilians to combatants is extremely high for modern warfare, even compared with conflicts notorious for indiscriminate killings in the Syrian and Sudanese wars.\nMeanwhile, experts warned that Gaza was at risk of famine. The Gaza Strip's largest city is now gripped by famine, according to the world's leading authority on food crises, the Associated Press reported.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Friday that famine was occurring in Gaza City, and is likely to spread to the southern cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nAid groups and food security experts have warned for months that Gaza was on the brink of famine, yet this is the first official confirmation.\nCOGAT, the Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, said the report was “false and biased”. It rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that in recent weeks, significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip.\nThe situation has vastly deteriorated in Gaza. The IPC report said that from early July until mid-August, it has seen the most severe deterioration since it began analysing food insecurity and malnutrition in Gaza. And despite the “unprecedented pace” over that time frame, the IPC expects the situation to get worse.\nOne third of Gaza's population is expected to experience catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of next month, the IPC said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas.\nFamine occurs when these conditions are met. The IPC was first set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia. It includes more than a dozen UN agencies, aid groups, governments and other bodies.\nFamine can appear in pockets, sometimes small ones, and so a formal classification requires caution."

      "text": "A man in Gaza carries a poster reading, \"Children are not terrorists.\" (Credit: AFP)\n'Israeli' data admits 83% of Gaza casualties are civilians, contradicting previous claims\nA joint investigation by +972 Magazine, its Hebrew-language partner Local Call, and the Guardian has found that Israeli Occupation Forces' (IOF) intelligence data indicates most Palestinians killed by 'Israel' are civilians.\nAccording to the report, five out of every six Palestinians killed in the genocide are not resistance fighters.\nThe investigation drew on a classified IOF intelligence database that, as of May 2025, listed 8,900 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fighters as dead or “probably dead.” At that time, the Gaza Health Ministry reported that around 53,000 Palestinians had been killed by IOF. This suggests that only 17 percent of the total fatalities were fighters, while the remaining 83 percent were civilians.\nWhen approached by +972 Magazine and Local Call, the IOF did not dispute the database’s existence or the number of Hamas and PIJ deaths. However, when questioned later by the Guardian, a spokesperson stated that “figures presented in the article are incorrect” and “do not reflect the data available” in the military’s systems, without clarifying which details were disputed. The military did not explain why its responses differed between publications.\nThe dataset named 47,653 Palestinians considered by 'Israeli' intelligence to be active members of Hamas or PIJ. This included 34,973 Hamas operatives and 12,702 PIJ operatives, based on internal documents allegedly seized from the groups in Gaza. Of the 8,900 killed, 7,330 were considered certain, while 1,570 were “probably dead.” Most were junior figures, with only 100–300 senior operatives reported killed out of 750 listed in the database.\nThe investigation notes that the civilian death toll may be even higher than reported. The Gaza Health Ministry’s numbers likely underestimate deaths, as they do not account for thousands buried under rubble.\nIn addition, 'Israeli' intelligence may have counted civilians with alleged ties to Hamas as fighters, including police officers or administrative staff, who are considered non-combatants under international law.\n“People are promoted to the rank of terrorist after their death,” said one intelligence source who accompanied the IOF on the ground. “If I had listened to the brigade, I would have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200 percent of Hamas operatives in the area.”\nThe ratio of civilian deaths is also likely to have increased since May, as nearly 2,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed while waiting for aid from the 'Israel'- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nThe 83 percent civilian casualty rate is extraordinarily high for modern warfare. According to the Guardian, only a few conflicts in recent decades, such as the Srebrenica genocide, the Rwandan genocide, and the Russian siege of Mariupol, have seen higher proportions of civilian deaths."

Only the Rwandan genocide, the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, and Russia’s 2022 siege of Mariupol recorded a higher civilian death rate, the authors noted.\nWhen asked to comment by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call, the Israeli military did not deny the existence of the intelligence database or the listed figures for Hamas and PIJ casualties.\nleaked audio recordings aired on Israel’s Channel 12, Aharon Haliva, the former head of military intelligence, claimed, “The fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations.”\nIsraeli politicians and military leaders have long inflated fighter death tolls, at times claiming as many as 20,000 fighters killed or insisting on a civilian-to-combatant ratio of 1:1 – figures that the report notes they do not believe in private.\nMeanwhile, Israeli rhetoric has increasingly mirrored genocidal language.\nIn leaked audio recordings aired on Israel’s Channel 12, Aharon Haliva, the former head of military intelligence, claimed, “The fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations.”\nHe went further, saying: “For each [victim] on 7 October, 50 Palestinians have to die … There’s no choice, they need a Nakba every now and then to feel the consequences.” The Nakba, or “catastrophe”, refers to the killing and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948 to make way for the creation of Israel.\nBy March, Gaza’s death toll had reached 50,000; it has since risen to beyond 62,000, according to the enclave’s health ministry. The total number of wounded has now exceeded 157,000.\nThe International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed between October 2023 and May 2024."

Instead, the classified data backs up the findings of several studies suggesting Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed civilians at a rate with few parallels in modern warfare.\nThe Israeli army confirmed the existence of the database, which is managed by the Military Intelligence Directorate (known by the Hebrew acronym “Aman”). Multiple intelligence sources familiar with the database said the army views it as the only authoritative tally of militant casualty figures. In the words of one of them: “There’s no other place to check.”\nThe database includes a list of 47,653 names of Palestinians in Gaza whom Aman considers to be active in the military wings of Hamas and PIJ; according to the sources, the list is based on the groups’ own internal documents acquired by the army (which +972, Local Call, and the Guardian were unable to verify). The database designates 34,973 of the names as operatives of Hamas and 12,702 as operatives of Islamic Jihad (a small number are listed as active with both groups, but these are counted only once in the overall total).\nAccording to the data, which was obtained in May of this year, the Israeli army believed it had killed around 8,900 operatives since October 7 — the deaths of 7,330 of whom were considered certain and 1,570 recorded as “probably dead.” The vast majority of them were junior, with the army suspecting it had killed 100-300 senior Hamas operatives out of a total of 750 named in the database.\nA source familiar with the database explained that a specific piece of intelligence is attached to the name of every operative on the list whom the army is sure it killed, justifying that designation. +972, Local Call, and the Guardian obtained the numerical data from the database without the names or additional intelligence reports.\nRecent Posts\nHow Moderate Senate Democrats Enabled Trump’s D.C.
