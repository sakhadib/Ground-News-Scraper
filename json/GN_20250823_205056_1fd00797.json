Tariffs will harm manufacturing still being done in the United States.\"\nThe White House said new tariffs on this sector would not stack on top of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs that are already targeting a wide range of countries, including major furniture suppliers like China and Vietnam.\nFederal data suggests those tariffs may be starting to show up in some furniture prices for consumers.\nThe latest Consumer Price Index shows that, while overall inflation held steady between June and July 2025, furniture and bedding prices increased by 0.9 percent month-to-month. Some experts have identified this as an early warning sign, while conceding that the impact of tariffs on prices has generally been less severe than anticipated, perhaps because many businesses are absorbing added costs instead of passing them on to consumers.\nIt remains to be seen how Trump's latest batch of tariffs on most trading partners that took effect earlier this month will impact these trends."

      "text": "Trump says he will place tariffs on furniture — causing shares of Wayfair, Williams-Sonoma to plunge\nPresident Trump announced Friday that his administration is investigating imported furniture for potential tariffs, sending shares of major home goods companies tumbling in after-hours trading.\nTrump said the probe would be wrapped up within 50 days, after which furniture imports would face duties at rates “yet to be determined.”\n“This will bring the Furniture Business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and States all across the Union,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.\nThe tariff threat hammered stocks of companies heavily reliant on foreign manufacturing. Wayfair, RH and Williams-Sonoma all saw their shares plunge following Trump’s announcement.\nWayfair, whose stock fell by more than 6% after the closing bell on Friday, imports much of its furniture inventory from overseas suppliers.\nShares of RH were also down more than 6% while Williams-Sonoma stock dropped more than 4% Friday evening.\nHowever, not all furniture companies suffered. La-Z-Boy shares actually rose nearly 2.5% on the news since the company conducts most of its manufacturing operations within the United States.\nThe furniture industry investigation adds to Trump’s growing list of sectoral tariff targets.\nHe has already imposed steep duties on automobiles, steel and aluminum while floating similar measures for copper, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\nFriday’s announcement left unclear whether furniture tariffs would stack on top of existing country-specific duty rates that Trump has negotiated through bilateral trade deals.\nThe Trump administration has spent months conducting trade negotiations with partners worldwide, seeking to rebalance what it views as unfair global commerce arrangements.\nRecent framework agreements with the European Union and China have provided some market stability, though many longer-term trade disputes remain unresolved.\nThe timing of potential furniture tariffs comes as the industry faces significant headwinds.\nCompanies like Wayfair have endured more than a year of declining demand for big-ticket items, including couches and dining room sets.\nThe furniture sales slump stems partly from a sluggish housing market as prospective buyers wait for interest rates to decline before making major purchases.\nFewer new home sales translate directly into reduced furniture demand, since consumers typically buy new furnishings when they move into different residences.\nPersistent inflation has also made consumers more selective about discretionary spending. Restaurants, clothing, travel and home decor have all experienced reduced sales as shoppers tighten their budgets.\nTrump’s tariff strategy aims to encourage companies to relocate manufacturing operations back to the United States, particularly in states with strong furniture-making traditions.\nNorth Carolina and other southeastern states historically served as major furniture production hubs before much of the industry migrated overseas in search of lower labor costs.\nThe investigation represents another step in Trump’s broader trade agenda focused on reducing America’s reliance on foreign manufacturing across multiple industries.\nPrevious tariff announcements have produced mixed results, with some companies announcing plans to reshore production while others have absorbed higher costs or passed them on to consumers.\nThe Post has sought comment from the American Home Furnishings Alliance."

Wayfair sunk 6.2% at $73 in after-hours trading on Friday, according to the Journal, while shares of RH slipped 7.5%. Williams-Sonoma saw its stock plunge 5.6%.\nTwo furniture retailers that make most of their products in North America were notable exceptions, however, with both La-Z-Boy and Ethan Allen Interiors seeing shares climb following the post. La-Z-Boy rose 2.5% to $37.48, while Ethan Allen soared 5.2% to $31.60.\nThe new tariff announcement comes a day after a Fox Business host was forced to acknowledge Trump's signature policy is hitting Americans in the pocket.\nDuring a Thursday afternoon segment on \"Claman Countdown,\" guest host Cheryl Casone acknowledged that the biggest \"blue chip\" stocks were taking a beating, and honed in on retail giant Walmart as a prime example.\nIt also comes after a a Minnesota small-business owner was brought to tears on CNN talking about the effect Trump's tariffs have had on her olive oil and vinegar shop."
