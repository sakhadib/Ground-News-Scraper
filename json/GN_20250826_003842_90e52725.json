      "news_title": "Four Republicans Running for Texas AG So Far",
      "news_link": "https://americafirstreport.com/four-republicans-running-for-texas-ag-so-far/",
      "bias": "Right",
      "text": "(Just The News)—Four Republicans so far are running for Texas attorney general.\nU.S. Chip Roy is the latest to announce he’s running for AG, joining state Sens. Joan Huffman and Mayes Middleton, and Aaron Reitz, a former Texas deputy attorney general.\nThey are vying to replace Attorney General Ken Paxton who is challenging incumbent U.S. Sen. John Cornyn.\nMiddleton, a Republican from Galveston, first announced his bid in April. He’s the only candidate with no prosecutorial experience. President of Middleton Oil Company, he also runs ranching, cattle, and farming operations. Middleton has served in both the Texas House and Senate and consistently ranks as among the most conservative members. He has championed a partial ban on taxpayer-funded lobbying, advocated for parental rights and school choice, authored bills to protect women’s and girls’ sports, bathrooms and locker rooms, and a ban on COVID vaccine mandates, among other legislation. He’s rejected a state pension and taxpayer-funded healthcare and donates his entire state salary to local charities.\nHuffman is running to become the first female attorney general of Texas. A former Harris County prosecutor and Criminal District Court judge, Huffman is the only three-time recipient of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association’s Law and Order Award. In the Texas Senate, she’s authored numerous bills to strengthen the criminal justice system and bring transparency and accountability to the judiciary.\nHuffman led the charge against the defund the police movement by authoring a new law, “Back the Blue Act,” which penalizes cities and counties that defund law enforcement. She authored critical bail reform legislation, leading a bipartisan movement in response to judges releasing violent criminals onto the streets only to keep committing violent crime. She authored new laws to enable the removal of prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law, to increase penalties for violent crimes, including for fentanyl trafficking involving murder, and several measures to protect victims, including human trafficking victims.\nReitz served in the AG’s office during the impeachment of Paxton, the only attorney general to be impeached in Texas history. Paxton was impeached by 60 House Republicans on 20 charges, including bribery. The Texas Senate acquitted him along party lines. During the impeachment trial, longtime Texas Ranger David Maxwell alleged female employes made sexual harassment complaints against Reitz. After the trial, additional lawsuits were filed by Paxton’s top deputies against each other alleging sexual harassment, falsifying documents and witness tampering, multiple news outlets reported.\nReitz next worked for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz while being called to testify in a federal bribery and extortion probe into Paxton. He then worked for the Trump Justice Department for three months.\nMore recently, Reitz came under fire for posting what appeared to be photo ops in Kerrville after the devastating Hill Country floods. Other criticism includes deleting more than 4,000 controversial tweets, including supporting arranged marriages, CBS News first reported.\nReitz, who ran for the Texas House District 47 seat in 2020 and lost, says he “embodies the Texas values of courage, perseverance, and a refusal to bend the knee” and will “defend law and order” and “fight woke ideology.”\nRoy announced his AG bid on Thursday, roughly eight months after President Donald Trump encouraged Republicans to primary him. As Roy opposed increasing the national debt and spending, Trump called him, “The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas,” saying he was “getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory – All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,” multiple news outlets reported.\nRoy says he delivered on Trump’s agenda and wanted to take his experience in Congress, as a federal prosecutor and a former First Assistant AG of Texas to “fight for Texas from Texas.”\nRoy previously worked under Paxton and for Cruz, was senior counsel to former Gov. Rick Perry, served as counsel on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and was the Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas. Serving four terms in Congress, Roy fought to reduce the size of government, reduce taxes, reduce government waste, fraud and abuse, strengthen border security, target foreign threats coming from cartels and the Chinese Communist Party, secure U.S. elections among other intiatives.\nAs attorney general, he says he’ll go after “Soros-funded judges and DA’s putting criminals on the streets,” as well as judicial mandates “that Texans pay for illegals in our public schools.”\nIt is unclear how Roy would do this in light of the Texas Constitution’s separation of powers. The Texas Constitution states that only the legislature and Texas Supreme Court can remove judges under specific circumstances. The Texas Constitution also requires that a free public education be provided to all children in Texas regardless of nationality.\nThe Republican primary election is March 3, 2026.\nTake Control of Your Future: Why Thousands of Americans Are Embracing Self-Directed IRAs\nMillions of Americans “trust” their retirement savings to one of the various companies who control their IRA, 401(k), or other retirement account. Oftentimes this “trust” is based solely on the common misconception that Americans have no other options beyond what their employers offer.\nThese default retirement accounts are suitable for many. Those with under $100,000 in their retirement would likely not see much of a difference if they took control of their savings. But for those with more at stake, the option of a self-directed IRA is becoming increasingly popular, especially for those who want to diversify outside of the de facto market investments favored by bulk retirement companies.\nRecent data shows that over 33% of investors are now fully self-directed, a significant jump from just 21% in 2019, as people turn to alternative investments to safeguard their futures. But what exactly is a self-directed IRA, and why are thousands flocking to versions backed by gold and silver? Let’s dive in and explore how this strategy, especially when partnered with trusted providers, can empower you to build a more resilient retirement portfolio.\nAt its core, a self-directed IRA is a type of individual retirement account that gives you the freedom to invest in a wider array of assets beyond the traditional stocks, bonds, and mutual funds offered by conventional IRAs. While standard IRAs are typically managed by brokerage firms with limited options, an SDIRA puts you in the driver’s seat. It’s held by a specialized custodian that allows alternative investments, such as real estate, cryptocurrencies, private equity, and—most notably—precious metals like gold and silver.\nThis flexibility is a game-changer for savvy investors. Unlike traditional IRAs, where your choices are confined to Wall Street’s offerings, an SDIRA lets you diversify into tangible assets that can weather economic storms. The setup process is similar to rolling over funds from an existing 401(k) or IRA, but with the added benefit of personalized control. However, it’s crucial to work with a reputable custodian to ensure compliance with IRS rules, avoiding penalties for prohibited transactions.\nThe Rising Popularity of Self-Directed IRAs\nWhy the surge in interest? Economic factors are driving the shift. With inflation eroding purchasing power and market fluctuations making headlines, Americans are looking for stability. Ownership of gold alone stands at about 10.8% among Americans, and U.S. retail demand for physical gold has spiked 15% in the last year. Self-directed IRAs, particularly those focused on precious metals, have become increasingly popular since the 2008 financial crisis, as investors seek hedges against volatility and recession.\nThousands are embracing SDIRAs because they offer:\n- Greater Diversification: Spread risk across assets that don’t correlate with the stock market.\n- Tax Advantages: Like traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred (or tax-free in Roth versions).\n- Control and Customization: Tailor your portfolio to your expertise and risk tolerance.\n- Protection Against Inflation: Alternative assets often hold value when paper currencies falter.\nBut among the options, gold and silver-backed SDIRAs stand out as a favorite for their timeless appeal and proven track record. According to Augusta Precious Metals, a gold IRA is a self-directed retirement account that provides a way to invest in physical gold — not just paper assets. It’s a powerful way to diversify, hedge and add a stabilizing factor to retirement savings.\nWhy Choose a Gold and Silver-Backed Self-Directed IRA?\nPrecious metals have been a store of value for centuries, and in today’s uncertain world, they’re more relevant than ever. A gold or silver IRA allows you to hold physical precious metals in your retirement account, providing a tangible hedge against economic downturns.\nHere’s why thousands are favoring this approach:\n- Hedge Against Inflation and Dollar Weakness: Gold and silver often rise in value when fiat currencies lose ground, preserving your wealth’s purchasing power.\n- Portfolio Stability: These metals can reduce overall volatility, acting as a counterbalance to stock-heavy portfolios during market crashes.\n- Geopolitical Safeguard: In times of global instability, precious metals offer security that digital or paper assets can’t match.\n- Long-Term Growth Potential: Historical data shows gold’s value has appreciated over time, with increasing demand from investors and industries alike.\nUnlike other alternatives like real estate, which can involve management hassles, gold and silver are easy to store and liquidate. Plus, with IRS-approved depositories handling secure storage, you get peace of mind without the headaches.\nAugusta Precious Metals: Your Partner in Gold and Silver IRAs\nWhen it comes to setting up a gold or silver-backed self-directed IRA, not all providers are created equal. Augusta Precious Metals has emerged as a leader, earning top ratings for transparency, service, and customer satisfaction.

      "text": "Texas [US], August 24 (ANI): The Texas Senate on Saturday (local time) approved a new Republican-leaning congressional map, paving the way for Governor Greg Abbott to sign it into law, The Hill reported.\nThe new Texas map secures an additional five Republican-leaning congressional districts, shifting the balance of power ahead of competitive midterm elections expected in 2026.\nAlso Read | Beirut District Refuses to Succumb to Lebanon’s Divisions.\nThe legislation cleared the Senate by 18 votes to 11, with Democrats opposing what they described as a partisan attempt to force Republican control. The move followed a similar party-line passage in the Texas House, where Democratic lawmakers had earlier staged a two-week boycott before returning to the chamber.\nThe Senate had initially passed the proposal during a previous special legislative session, but fresh approval was required after that session ended. Abbott convened a second session this week, allowing the House-passed version to move forward.\nIn a post on X, Abbott welcomed the passage and said, \"The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate. Despite Democrats' petty stunts, we delivered on our promise. This map reflects Texans' actual voting preferences, and I look forward to signing it into law.\"\nAs reported by The Hill, Democrats have pledged to challenge the legislation in court. Representative Suzan DelBene, Chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, termed the plan an \"unprovoked, unwarranted Texas gerrymander.\"\n\"We are seeing Democrats around the country respond and fight back to make sure DC Republicans cannot steal the House majority,\" Suzan DelBene said. \"I applaud the Texas Democratic lawmakers who have been at the forefront of this fight and inspired people across the country to stand up and fight back against Republicans' shameful attempt to cling onto power,\" she added.\nThe developments in Texas come amid similar redistricting efforts across the country. In California, the legislature this week approved a ballot measure that will allow voters to decide on new district lines for the remainder of the decade. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the measure into law shortly after its passage. The revised map could provide Democrats with up to five additional seats in the House, The Hill reported.\nRepublican-led states, including Florida and Missouri, are also considering new congressional boundaries, signalling that the battle over redistricting is likely to intensify ahead of the midterm polls.

Chip Roy, state Sens. Joan Huffman and Mayes Middleton, and former deputy AG Aaron Reitz.\nChip Roy, a four-term congressman and former federal prosecutor, launched his campaign Thursday. Despite criticism from President Donald Trump in 2023 for opposing GOP spending plans, Roy says he remains committed to Trump’s agenda. He previously worked under Paxton, Sen. Ted Cruz, and former Gov. Rick Perry. Roy vows to fight “Soros-funded judges,” secure elections, and prevent taxpayer funds from supporting illegal immigration—though some pledges may conflict with constitutional limits.\nSen. Mayes Middleton of Galveston announced his campaign in April. A conservative businessman and rancher, he has no prosecutorial background but is known for leading legislation on school choice, women’s sports protections, and bans on taxpayer-funded lobbying and vaccine mandates. Middleton donates his entire state salary to charity and refuses state benefits.\nSen. Joan Huffman brings the strongest law enforcement credentials. A former Harris County prosecutor and criminal court judge, Huffman has authored key laws backing police, overhauling bail reform, and increasing penalties for violent crimes. She’s also passed legislation enabling the removal of rogue prosecutors and laws supporting victims, including those of human trafficking.\nAaron Reitz, a former Paxton deputy, is best known for his involvement during Paxton’s impeachment trial. His tenure drew scrutiny after allegations of harassment surfaced and controversial past statements were uncovered. Despite criticism, Reitz portrays himself as a staunch conservative ready to fight “woke ideology.”\nThe Republican primary is set for March 3, 2026."

US politics ‘It’s legal’: Texas redistricting map heads for governor’s final sign-off in win for Trump Lawsuits accuse state Republicans of illegally drawing congressional boundaries along racial lines that diminish Black and Latino voting power\nSenate passes new congressional maps\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email Texas Governor Greg Abbott is imminently expected to sign off on the state’s radically redrawn congressional map , igniting a national redistricting battle ahead of 2026 midterm elections with the balance of power in Congress at stake.\nThe Republican governor said he will “swiftly” sign the map into law after the GOP-dominated state legislature gave it a final, party-line vote in the early hours of Saturday.\nThe map, which sets the boundaries for each district that represents the state in the House of Representatives, was explicitly redrawn under President Donald Trump’s command to ensure Republican candidates will win up to five new seats — delivering a huge boost to preserve the GOP’s thin House majority.\nIn his closing statement in support of the map, Republican state Senator Phil King repeatedly warned that the GOP would lose the House majority without it, while insisting that the boundaries were not gerrymandered along racial lines.\nHours later, a lawsuit accused the state of pushing a racially discriminatory map that unconstitutionally diminished the voting strength of Black and Hispanic Texans and “dismantles” minority-led districts to keep Republicans in power.\nopen image in gallery\nThe GOP-dominated state legislature in Texas gave final approval to the state’s new congressional boundaries in the early morning hours on August 23 (REUTERS) “This map is legal in all respects,” King said.\n“I’m convinced that if Texas does not take this action, there is an extreme risk that [the] Republican majority will be lost,” he added. “If it does, the next two years after the midterm, there will be nothing but inquisitions and impeachments and humiliation for our country.”\nTexas Republicans advanced the map despite a group of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to break quorum in a long-shot bid to prevent the state legislature from doing any business during a 30-day special session requested by the governor.\nDozens of Texas Democrats declared victory last week after staying out of the state for more than two weeks, temporarily blocking Republicans’ Trump-led gerrymandering campaign while bringing national attention to the fight.\nBut a second special session was called, allowing Republican lawmakers to quickly take up another vote on the map.\nDemocrats’ return to the state allowed them to create the “legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court, take our message to communities across the state and country, and inspire legislators across the country how to fight these undemocratic redistricting schemes in their own statehouses,” Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement this week.\nopen image in

along racial lines that diminish Black and Latino voting power (AP) “Despite Democrats’ petty stunts, we delivered on our promise,” Abbott said Saturday. “This map reflects Texans’ actual voting preferences, and I look forward to signing it into law.”\nThe Texas fight quickly escalated across the country, with both GOP-led and Democratic states pursuing mid-decade changes to their congressional maps in a political arms race that could lead to explosive legal battles as voters prepare to cast their ballots next year.\nOn Thursday, Democratic lawmakers in California approved a new map that could swing five Republican-held seats to Democrats. Unlike the process for map changes in Texas, voters in California will have to approve the redistricting efforts in a referendum expected this November.\nRobert Weiner — director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which represents the Texas NAACP in the ongoing lawsuit against Texas for racial gerrymandering — said the Texas map is “illegal.”\n“The architects of this racially discriminatory plan clearly targeted minority voters,” he added. “The legislators bulldozed important majority minority districts. It eliminates opportunities of Black and Brown people to elect their preferred candidates in multiple Congressional districts.”\nA federal judge will hold a hearing on the challenge on August 27.\nThe League of Women Voters of the United States said the map is “designed to rig elections and silence voters.”\n“Governor Abbott and Texas Republicans are abusing the redistricting process to bow down to an unpopular president who has no shame in thwarting the Constitution for his own benefit,” the group said in a statement Saturday.\n\"Texans deserve fair maps drawn to reflect their communities — not partisan lines manipulated to entrench power,” the statement said.\nThank you for registering Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

The legislation cleared the Senate by 18 votes to 11, with Democrats opposing what they described as a partisan attempt to force Republican control. The move followed a similar party-line passage in the Texas House, where Democratic lawmakers had earlier staged a two-week boycott before returning to the chamber.The Senate had initially passed the proposal during a previous special legislative session, but fresh approval was required after that session ended. Abbott convened a second session this week, allowing the House-passed version to move forward.In a post on X, Abbott welcomed the passage and said, “The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate. Despite Democrats’ petty stunts, we delivered on our promise. This map reflects Texans’ actual voting preferences, and I look forward to signing it into law.\"As reported by The Hill, Democrats have pledged to challenge the legislation in court. Representative Suzan DelBene, Chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, termed the plan an “unprovoked, unwarranted Texas gerrymander.\"“We are seeing Democrats around the country respond and fight back to make sure DC Republicans cannot steal the House majority,\" Suzan DelBene said. “I applaud the Texas Democratic lawmakers who have been at the forefront of this fight and inspired people across the country to stand up and fight back against Republicans’ shameful attempt to cling onto power,\" she added.The developments in Texas come amid similar redistricting efforts across the country. In California, the legislature this week approved a ballot measure that will allow voters to decide on new district lines for the remainder of the decade. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the measure into law shortly after its passage. The revised map could provide Democrats with up to five additional seats in the House, The Hill reported.Republican-led states, including Florida and Missouri, are also considering new congressional boundaries, signalling that the battle over redistricting is likely to intensify ahead of the midterm polls.

      "text": "Fresh off Texas Senate’s approval, new congressional map is target of lawsuit\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nHours after the Texas Senate approved a new congressional map early Saturday morning that more heavily favors Republicans — legislation Gov. Greg Abbott plans to “swiftly” sign into law — a lawsuit against the governor was filed, alleging that the redrawn districts are racially discriminatory.\nThe 67-page complaint against Abbott and Secretary of State Jane Nelson supplements legal action filed by LULAC in 2021 challenging the state’s original maps and argues that redrawing districts mid-decade is unconstitutional.\nRedistricting usually happens at the start of the decade after U.S. census data comes out. The complaint argues that because the new map was drawn based on the same data used for the initial map passed by the Legislature in 2021, the measure was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.\n“Even if racial and partisan considerations are an unavoidable part of redistricting, there is no need for legislatures to take those considerations into account a second time in a single decade,” the complaint reads.\nThe complaint, which is expected to be followed by others targeting House Bill 4, was filed by two law firms on behalf of 13 Texas residents collectively called “the Gonzales plaintiffs.” The bulk of their argument is that the new congressional map “dismantles majority-minority districts” by prioritizing Republican representation in Congress.\nAbbott’s office has not responded to requests for comment.\nOn the Senate floor Friday, Sen. Phil King, R-Weatherford who carried HB 4 in the upper chamber, said the plan “meets the critically important goals of legality, of political performance for Republicans and of improved compactness,” and that he did not consider racial population data while crafting it.\nRepublicans pushed for the new map with their eyes set on gaining five more seats in Congress after pressure from President Donald Trump, who wants to preserve the GOP’s slim U.S. House majority in the 2026 midterms. But the complaint says that effort came at the cost of Latino and Black communities, which have largely supported Democratic candidates.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nThe new lines squeeze more Democratic voters in Houston and Dallas into districts the minority party already controls — a strategy known as “packing.” The Republican-backed map also “cracks” left-leaning communities by splitting voters who supported Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024 into Republican districts, according to an analysis by The Texas Tribune.\nThe complaint was filed by two law firms, The Law Office of Max Renea Hicks and the Elias Law Group, the firm of prominent Democratic attorney Marc Elias. They also allege that the new maps violate the Voting Rights Act for not creating enough Latino-majority districts to match the growth of Texas’ Latino population.\nFor example, the complaint points to Harris County, where the new map carves out only one district that’s majority Latino, although the county is nearly half Latino, according to the latest U.S. census.\nThe census also confirmed that Latinos make up the largest share of Texas’ population, and that Texans of color made up 95% of the state’s population growth in the last decade — but that’s not reflected in the new congressional map, the complaint alleges.\nWith the new district lines, the lawsuit charges, lawmakers are “intentionally destroying majority-minority districts and replacing them with majority-Anglo districts.”\nDemocratic lawmakers have waged a lively battle to fend off the GOP’s proposed map since Abbott announced that the first special session in July would include redistricting. House Democrats fled the state halfway through the first session, breaking the lower chamber’s quorum and halting all operations. But the members returned to Austin at the start of the second session.\nAnd on Friday, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, signaled her intention to filibuster the map well into Saturday. Republicans, however, ended the debate on HB 4, killing her effort. Lawmakers also listened to hours of hearings from Texans across the state who pleaded with them to leave their districts alone.\nThe complaint and others that are sure to follow are a sign that Democrats and civil rights groups will continue to fight the implementation of the maps ahead of the 2026 election.\nThe National Redistricting Foundation, which brought LULAC’s initial lawsuit, is also directing this new case.\n“Texas’s existing map already dilutes the voting power of communities of color,” Marina Jenkins, the foundation’s executive director, said in a news release.\n“In spite of that, the state has doubled down with an even more extreme racial gerrymander that goes even further to pack and crack communities of color and minimize the number of congressional districts where minority voters have the ability to elect candidates of their choice,” she later said. “The court has already agreed to consider expediting this case, and we are confident that justice will be delivered for Texans.”\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

      "text": "Texas legislators approved early on Saturday a new electoral map aimed at carving out five new Republican-leaning seats in the State to help the party retain control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.\nU.S. President Donald Trump had pressured the Republican-run Texas to create the new map to help prevent Democratic opponents from taking over the House of Representatives in 2026, halfway through his term.\nThe State Senate voted along party lines to pass the map 18-11 shortly after midnight, following more than eight hours of heated debate.\nDemocratic Senator Carol Alvarado's last-ditch plans to filibuster the map were thwarted when Republicans used a rare procedural motion to halt debate, end the filibuster, and proceed directly to the final vote.\nDemocratic Senator Sarah Eckhardt said on X that shutting down a filibuster was \"unprecedented.\" \"This is not democracy, this is disgraceful,\" she added.\nIt now heads to Governor Greg Abbott's office, where the Republican is expected to swiftly sign it into law.\nThe Bill had been adopted by the state legislature's lower chamber last week. \"On our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday (August 23, 2025) after the bill sailed through the House. \"Texas never lets us down.\"\nThe vote caps weeks of dramatic political theatre that saw Democratic lawmakers flee the state in July to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the redistricting plan, and drew nationwide attention to partisan redistricting, known as \"gerrymandering.\"\nThe exodus led to a tense standoff with Mr. Abbott threatening to have Democrats arrested upon their return.\n'Legal in all respects'\nThe Democrats claim the new electoral map dilutes the votes of African-American and Hispanic electorates who usually vote them.\nThe Texas Senate Democratic Caucus said on X on Friday (August 22, 2025) that the state \"has a shameful history of racial discrimination. These maps are just the latest entry in that history.\" That stance echoed in the floor debate.\nDemocratic Senator Borris Miles denounced the Republicans' complicity in \"racist actions,\" saying the new map \"does not reflect the truth of Texas, but instead manipulates and whitewashes it.\" But Republican Todd Hunter hit back at the arguments, saying, \"The created four out of five new seats are Hispanic majority.\"\n\"I'm convinced that if Texas does not take this action, there is an extreme risk that the Republican majority will be lost,\" Republican Phil King said on the floor. \"This map is legal in all respects,\" Mr. King said.\nCalifornia countermove\nThe cutthroat political gambit spurred California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, to launch a process for redrawing his state's map — this time creating five potentially new seats for Democrats.\n\"If Texas wants to play hardball, we'll play hardball right back,\" Mr. Newsom said in announcing the California initiative. Although Mr. Newsom hopes to cancel out the Republicans' advantages gained in Texas, his plan still requires voter approval in an election this November.\nBoth parties are now looking to other states where the rules might allow hasty redrawing of maps in ways that would create more seats. Beyond Texas, Mr. Trump encouraged Florida, Indiana, and Missouri's maps to be redrawn to Republican advantage.\nThe redistricting battle adds a volatile and high-stakes new element to next year's elections.\nRepublicans currently control both houses of Congress, and the party's legislators largely operate to carry out Mr. Trump's wishes.\nBeleaguered Democrats are hoping that the unpopularity of many of Mr. Trump's policies will help spark a takeover of the lower house. If Democrats did win, they would immediately gain power to investigate Mr. Trump and his controversial government members.\nPublished - August 23, 2025 09:04 pm IST"

      "text": "(The Center Square) – Four Republicans so far are running for Texas attorney general.\nU.S. Chip Roy is the latest to announce he’s running for AG, joining state Sens. Joan Huffman and Mayes Middleton, and Aaron Reitz, a former Texas deputy attorney general.\nThey are vying to replace Attorney General Ken Paxton who is challenging incumbent U.S. Sen. John Cornyn.\nMiddleton, a Republican from Galveston, first announced his bid in April. He’s the only candidate with no prosecutorial experience. President of Middleton Oil Company, he also runs ranching, cattle, and farming operations. Middleton has served in both the Texas House and Senate and consistently ranks as among the most conservative members. He has championed a partial ban on taxpayer-funded lobbying, advocated for parental rights and school choice, authored bills to protect women’s and girls’ sports, bathrooms and locker rooms, and a ban on COVID vaccine mandates, among other legislation. He’s rejected a state pension and taxpayer-funded healthcare and donates his entire state salary to local charities.\nHuffman is running to become the first female attorney general of Texas. A former Harris County prosecutor and Criminal District Court judge, Huffman is the only three-time recipient of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association’s Law and Order Award. In the Texas Senate, she’s authored numerous bills to strengthen the criminal justice system and bring transparency and accountability to the judiciary.\nHuffman led the charge against the defund the police movement by authoring a new law, “Back the Blue Act,” which penalizes cities and counties that defund law enforcement. She authored critical bail reform legislation, leading a bipartisan movement in response to judges releasing violent criminals onto the streets only to keep committing violent crime. She authored new laws to enable the removal of prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law, to increase penalties for violent crimes, including for fentanyl trafficking involving murder, and several measures to protect victims, including human trafficking victims.\nReitz served in the AG's office during the impeachment of Paxton, the only attorney general to be impeached in Texas history. Paxton was impeached by 60 House Republicans on 20 charges, including bribery. The Texas Senate acquitted him along party lines. During the impeachment trial, longtime Texas Ranger David Maxwell alleged female employes made sexual harassment complaints against Reitz. After the trial, additional lawsuits were filed by Paxton’s top deputies against each other alleging sexual harassment, falsifying documents and witness tampering, multiple news outlets reported.\nReitz next worked for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz while being called to testify in a federal bribery and extortion probe into Paxton. He then worked for the Trump Justice Department for three months.\nMore recently, Reitz came under fire for posting what appeared to be photo ops in Kerrville after the devastating Hill Country floods. Other criticism includes deleting more than 4,000 controversial tweets, including supporting arranged marriages, CBS News first reported.\nReitz, who ran for the Texas House District 47 seat in 2020 and lost, says he “embodies the Texas values of courage, perseverance, and a refusal to bend the knee” and will “defend law and order” and “fight woke ideology.”\nRoy announced his AG bid on Thursday, roughly eight months after President Donald Trump encouraged Republicans to primary him. As Roy opposed increasing the national debt and spending, Trump called him, “The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas,” saying he was “getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory – All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,” multiple news outlets reported.\nRoy says he delivered on Trump’s agenda and wanted to take his experience in Congress, as a federal prosecutor and a former First Assistant AG of Texas to “fight for Texas from Texas.”\nRoy previously worked under Paxton and for Cruz, was senior counsel to former Gov. Rick Perry, served as counsel on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and was the Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas. Serving four terms in Congress, Roy fought to reduce the size of government, reduce taxes, reduce government waste, fraud and abuse, strengthen border security, target foreign threats coming from cartels and the Chinese Communist Party, secure U.S. elections among other intiatives.\nAs attorney general, he says he’ll go after “Soros-funded judges and DA’s putting criminals on the streets,” as well as judicial mandates “that Texans pay for illegals in our public schools.”\nIt is unclear how Roy would do this in light of the Texas Constitution’s separation of powers. The Texas Constitution states that only the legislature and Texas Supreme Court can remove judges under specific circumstances. The Texas Constitution also requires that a free public education be provided to all children in Texas regardless of nationality.\nThe Republican primary election is March 3, 2026.\nPost a comment as Anonymous Commenter\nReport\nWatch this discussion.\n(0) comments\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nKeep it Clean.

Hypocritical Democrats, who are infamous for their years of gerrymandering, will no doubt scream hysterically at this news.\nThe Texas Senate reportedly voted 18-11 to pass the bill, which authorized in the state a new congressional mid-census redistricting map expected to favor Republicans. The state senators voted at 12:30 a.m. on Saturday, passing the legislation to the final stage of the process; namely, gubernatorial signature.\nAnd it will definitely receive the signature. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) celebrated the bill’s passage, “The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate. Despite Democrats’ petty stunts, we delivered on our promise. This map reflects Texans’ actual voting preferences, and I look forward to signing it into law.”\nDemocrats have been raising furor across the country about the legislation, alleging that it unfairly favors Republicans. Their accusations ring hollow in light of previous truly unfair Democrat redistricting in blue states such as California and New York. Some Republicans in turn accuse the Democrats of previously have rigged congressional districts in Texas, arguing this new map corrected the problem. Democrats in the Texas legislature also roused ire by fleeing the state in an attempt to block passage of the bill.\nThe Texas House passed the legislation earlier this week. Both houses in the Texas legislature are majority Republican.\nREDISTRICTING: Texas has finally eliminated racially gerrymandered congressional districts. Now the Democrats will sue to restore the discriminatory maps. pic.twitter.com/B5DFE0pGYy\n— @amuse (@amuse) August 23, 2025\nRead Also: DeSantis Undeterred by Woke Ruling on Alligator Alcatraz\nGov. Abbott commented Saturday on the redistricting while responding on X to polling showing a decrease in Democrat Party registration and an increase in Republican Party registration. “Drawing new congressional lines is just the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “The iceberg itself, which will change elections across America, is the fact that crazy leftist policies by Democrats are causing more Americans to flee Democrats and vote Republican.”\nSenator Carol Alvarado (D-Houston) had previously announced her intention of filibustering the bill to force a continuation of the debate over the legislation. But, Breitbart reported, the Senate Republican Caucus found out that Alvarado was aiming to use the filibuster “as a fund-raising gimmick,” and ended the ploy.\nThe Republican senators said Alvarado’s campaign email violated the “long-standing traditions, ethics, and decorum of the Texas Senate.” The senators seized the opportunity to exercise a parliamentary procedure by “calling the question,” forcing a vote on the measure.\nThe legislature therefore passed the redistricting bill just after Saturday began.\nPresident Donald Trump supported the Texas redistricting, previously celebrating the passage of the legislation for the new map in the Texas House. This could be excellent news for Republicans come the midterms, especially if other red states are inspired to follow Texas’s example.\nSupport our work at PJ Media so that we can continue to bring you the truth.

It moves Democrat Rep. Marc Veasey’s district from Tarrant to Dallas County, Democrat Rep. Julie Johnson’s district moves from Dallas and Collin County to more conservative sections of East Texas, and Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s Dallas seat becomes one of just two majority Black districts in the entire state.\nThe Democrats claim the redrawn maps will violate the federal Voting Rights Act, but that may be difficult for them to prove.\nIn Central Texas, Democrats Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett find their districts vastly different from the most recent map.\nThe district currently held by Casar would no longer include Travis County, while the district held by Doggett would no longer include a portion of Williamson County.\nIn Houston, the new map reshapes four currently Democrat-held districts.

      "text": "The Texas Legislature has approved a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts, a move that could help Republicans win five more US House seats, as requested last month by President Trump. The plan now heads to Gov. Greg Abbott for expected signing.\nThe Senate passed the plan after an 18-11 vote late Friday night. The redistricting is part of a growing nationwide contest, sparked by Trump, involving Texas, California, and possibly other states, over congressional maps ahead of the midterm elections.\nTexas State Sen. Phil King, who defended the plan in the Senate, acknowledged the political aim of the mid-decade redistricting. “For the map to be legal in all respects, that was the first goal,” King said. “And the second one was that it would perform better for Republican congressional candidates in Texas.”\nTrump praised the Texas plan, tweeting, “Texas never lets us down,” and stressed the stakes of controlling Congress. “More seats equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT,” he wrote.\nDemocrats have promised to challenge the map in court, saying it weakens the voting power of Black and Latino communities and creates sprawling districts that split urban areas and link them with suburban and rural regions.\nDemocratic State Sen. Judith Zaffirini said she opposed the plan “not only because it disregards the growth and diversity of our state but also because it further erodes the strength of minority districts, diminishing our ability to elect candidates of our choice and silencing voices that deserve to be heard.”\nImpact Shorts\nView AllThe Senate’s approval came after hours of debate on Friday. The redistricting effort in Texas, launched after a call from Abbott and Trump last month, prompted California Democrats to respond with their own new map.\nOn Thursday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a plan that could give Democrats five extra congressional seats. Lawmakers also approved a special election measure in November to allow the state to implement the map, bypassing the independent citizen redistricting commission.\nRedistricting usually happens after the national census at the start of each decade, and how voters are grouped can be crucial in deciding who wins congressional seats. Texas currently has 38 House seats, with Republicans holding 25 and Democrats 13.\nCalifornia Democrats argued their response is necessary. “This isn’t politics as usual,” said Democratic Assemblymember Anamarie Avila Farias. “This is an emergency for our state. This is an emergency for our country. This is an emergency for democracy.”\nRepublicans countered that only the state’s redistricting commission should redraw maps. “You move forward fighting fire with fire, what happens? You burn it all down. In this case, it affects our most fundamental American principle. Representation,” said Republican Minority Leader James Gallagher. He called the plan “Gavinmander,” and said it was pushed illegally.\nDemocrats said sending the final decision to voters makes the process more transparent. The White House has also encouraged Republicans in other states to consider redrawing maps in their favor."

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Democrats prepared for a final show of resistance against a Republican effort to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade, signaling plans to speak late into Friday night on the Senate floor in an attempt to delay final passage.\nIt's the latest chapter in a weekslong showdown that has roiled the Texas Legislature, marked by a Democratic walkout and threats of arrest from Republicans. While much of the drama has unfolded in the House - where the map ultimately passed on Wednesday - Democrats are mounting one last breath of resistance as the maps move toward likely approval.\n\"Republicans think they can walk all over us. Today I'm going to kick back,\" Democratic state Sen. Carol Alvarado wrote on social media Friday. \"I've submitted my intention to filibuster the new congressional maps. Going to be a long night.\"\nDemocrats had already delayed the bill's passage during hours of debate, pressing state Sen. Phil King, the measure's sponsor, on the proposal's legality, with many alleging that the redrawn districts violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting voters' influence based on race - an accusation King vehemently denied.\n\"I had two goals in mind: That all maps would be legal and would be better for Republican congressional candidates in Texas,\" said King, a Republican.\nAlvarado, chair of the Texas Senate Democratic Caucus, will not be able to take breaks to eat, drink or even go to the bathroom once she starts. She will be required to remain standing and cannot sit down or lean on her chair, desk or other lawmakers for support.\nHer filibuster is unlikely to do more than delay the inevitable. In 2021, Alvarado spoke for 15 hours to protest GOP voting restrictions that ultimately became law.\nThe showdown in Texas has inflamed a broader, state-by-state redistricting battle, with governors from both parties pledging to redraw their congressional maps. It was kicked off by President Donald Trump pushing Texas Republicans to redraw the state's U.S. House map to help the party gain more seats in 2026.\nRELATED: Texas House approves new congressional map that favors Republicans in 2026 midterms\nCalifornia Democrats have punched back.

      "text": "Rep. Todd Hunter had just started to lay out the new maps — the mid-decade redistricting blueprint that had sparked protests, a weeks-long walkout by Democrats and flurries of legal threats — when he paused to emphasize the reason for all of this.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: Improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, said Wednesday from the floor of the Texas House.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nNot improve the representation of Texans.\nNot improve the effectiveness of government.\nNot help voters, but help politicians.\nThe redistricting plan passed by the Texas House this week plainly aims to add five GOP seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, protecting one party from the political verdict that might otherwise be rendered next year by voters assessing the first half of President Donald Trump’s unpopular second term.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe goal is to prevent democracy from working as it should — an outcome that should alarm voters of all types.\nAs this board noted last month, both political parties play gerrymandering games when they hold power, distorting district lines to press their advantage. Communities are carved up, and some constituents are left without a voice.\nTexas’ latest gerrymandering gambit is particularly egregious, dismantling districts that had elected Latino and African American members of Congress, sweeping even more urban voters into far-flung rural districts where their priorities would rate as an afterthought.\nAs Houston Democratic Rep. Armando Walle put it: “It treats our voters as crash-test dummies.”\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nTexas’ redistricting ploy has triggered an arms race of sorts, with California moving to respond in kind, and other states considering crafting even more weaponized maps. We are hurtling toward a form of mutually-assured destruction: Democrats across Austin won’t have the full representation they deserve, so Republicans around San Diego won’t, either.\nThis unraveling of democracy is wrong. It cheats voters across the political spectrum. And with each turn, the damage becomes harder to undo.\nIn a nation founded on the idea that governments derive “their just powers from the consent of the governed,” Texas GOP lawmakers instead showed contempt for the voters. They held only a handful of public hearings on the redistricting ploy — before the maps were even available — and even then, Republicans acted like they were doing Texans a favor. “We were not required to hold those hearings,” Hunter said.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nNot that GOP lawmakers listened. Between those who spoke at the public hearings and those who submitted comments online, Texans who opposed redistricting outnumbered supporters by a 100-to-1 margin.\nStill, the Republicans pressed ahead. The Democratic lawmakers who opposed this unpopular plan with one of the few tools the minority party has — a quorum break — faced intrusive police monitoring, at taxpayer cost, upon their return.\nTexans can debate whether it helped or hurt Democrats’ cause to temporarily leave the state rather than fight the bill on the House floor. But it was an abuse of power for House Speaker Dustin Burrows to demand the returning Democrats sign a “permission slip” allowing state troopers to follow them through Capitol corridors, to their homes, even on their morning walks. If Burrows’ goal was to humble Democrats, he instead gave them a new platform for resistance, with Rep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, spending two nights in the House chamber because she refused to sign the form, rejecting the premise that dissenting lawmakers should be treated like prisoners.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nIt’s no surprise that a process steeped in such contempt would produce maps that disregard the interests of so many Texans. Tech workers in East Travis County are placed in the same congressional district as commercial fishermen 200 miles away in Rockport, while San Marcos families with kids at the same elementary school will have different members of Congress. District lines will slice through 444 voting precincts across the state, separating voters from the neighbors they see at church or the grocery store.\nThose lines were crafted with laser-like precision to engineer a certain electoral outcome, with no regard for the actual contours of communities and the interests that bind them. Texans already disillusioned with Congress will see even less of themselves in a supposedly representative government.\n“This is where division becomes dictatorship, the government against the people,” Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso, who did not join the quorum break, said during Wednesday’s House floor debate. “Some people here are doing so much winning, they can't see what we're all losing.”\nIn Austin, the political casualties include U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a stalwart champion for Central Texas during his three decades in Congress, who announced Thursday he won’t battle U.S. Rep. Greg Casar in the Democratic primary if the new maps stand and their two districts are largely merged. The diminishment of Austin’s clout in Washington, turning two representatives into one, is that stark.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nEven as Texas Democrats cheer on the gerrymandering of California, and Texas Republicans complain about Illinois’ skewed maps, we all continue to lose the same thing. An America where all voters have a voice, where government hinges on the consent of the governed.\nWe can only hope, in time, that the damage from this scorched-earth crusade will prompt members of Congress from both parties to adopt commonsense reforms like banning partisan gerrymandering and mid-decade redistricting efforts. Perhaps the U.S. Supreme Court, which has seen fit to reexamine long-standing precedents in other areas, will reconsider its own problematic rulings unwinding the Voting Rights Act and permitting fiercely partisan maps.\nBut for now, with these new congressional districts, Texas Republican lawmakers have further eroded public trust and accelerated an electoral race to the bottom. The lines on these maps serve politicians, not the people they are supposed to represent.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nElected officials should answer to voters, not hide behind rigged maps that strip voters of their power — and democracy of its meaning.\nWe want to hear from you.

      "text": "To beat Texas Republicans, California Dems want to load the dice\nGOP lawmakers in California angered by retaliatory redistricting\nRepublicans in the Texas Legislature want to help their party capture as many as five additional seats in Congress by remapping the state’s districts, but Democrats in California are making countermoves to try to keep the status quo. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Election Rigging Response Act on Thursday, teeing up a statewide referendum on the matter in November.\nAt least one Republican assemblyman hoped it wouldn’t come to this.\n“I would love to see all the states stop their efforts to redistrict midcycle,” Republican Assemblyman Josh Hoover told me, referring to the campaign to change congressional boundaries in between U.S. censuses. The process, known as gerrymandering, maps out districts based on voting patterns that favor one political party over the other. “I don’t think Texas should be doing it. I don’t think California should be doing it. I think it’s very inappropriate for any state to do that.”\nThe U.S. Constitution mandates that each state have representation in the House of Representatives proportional to its population as determined by a census taken every 10 years. Historically, states have adjusted their districts every 10 years, using data from Census Bureau.\nCalifornia has a constitutional provision against redistricting between censuses, which is why Democrats must pass a statewide referendum before redrawing their congressional districts in a way that makes them more likely to win elections. Republican legislators from California who spoke to WORLD condemned the redistricting effort as a blatant partisan power grab. Democrats say Republicans opened the door; they are just walking through it.\nPresident Donald Trump has cheered partisan gerrymandering efforts like the one in Texas. Last week, Newsom responded with a statement excoriating Trump and “his Republican lapdogs.”\n“This moment calls for urgency and action—that is what we are putting before voters this November: a chance to fight back against his anti-American ways,” Newsom said.\nCalifornia’s Election Rigging Response Act would allow the state to adopt new congressional maps if—and only if—Republican states actually go through with their plans. The maps are designed to help California Democrats win five more seats in Congress.\nCurrently, California puts the redistricting process in the hands of a commission composed of 14 members who can serve once every 10 years. Five member are from the largest political party based on state registration, five are from the second largest, and four are unregistered with any party. Commission members must have voted in two of the last three statewide general elections.\nCalifornia put that commission in place through a constitutional amendment approved in 2008.\nRepublicans are betting that voters will chafe at the idea of having to reimplement a practice they already did away with.\n“Among Republicans in the Capitol, the concern is the same: this is a dangerous precedent,” Republican Assemblywoman Heather Hadwick said. “If the independent commission can be bypassed here, it can be bypassed anywhere. That undermines the trust Californians placed in the system when they voted to remove politicians from the process in the first place.”\nShe declined to comment on the redistricting efforts in Texas.\nAssemblywoman Diane Dixon also declined to comment on whether Texas lawmakers should continue their plan, but she noted that California’s effort actively looks to suspend part of existing law. That’s different from Texas—where there is no law against gerrymandering.\n“Even ‘temporarily’ killing off a piece of democracy could be used by future politicians to undermine constitutional safeguards,” said Dixon, who is Republican. “We have a California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission, which was created by voters to take the power of drawing political districts out of the hands of politicians and put it where it belongs—with the people.”\nEarly polling in California suggests that voters have mixed feelings about the redistricting effort.\nFindings from TrueDot in partnership with Politico on Thursday found that as many as 70% of Democratic respondents believed gerrymandering is always unacceptable. The same findings showed that 63% of Democrats said they supported California’s effort in light of Texas’ plans.\n“That is a very low start,” Assemblyman Hoover said in reference to the poll results. “Once there’s a campaign that is explaining what this really does, I think this fails by quite a bit.”\nThis keeps me from having to slog through digital miles of other news sites. —Nick\nSign up to receive The Stew, WORLD’s free weekly email newsletter on politics and government.\nPlease wait while we load the latest comments...\nComments\nPlease register, subscribe, or log in to comment on this article."

And um the party, the Democratic Party definitely supports it,\" Leunes said.\nThe session is also addressing a recent federal court ruling that declared displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms unconstitutional. Dyson believes the matter will ultimately reach the Supreme Court.\n\"Here in Texas right now, it's just a partial preliminary injunction only affects certain school districts that were brought up in the lawsuit, but I think ultimately this is going to be a decision for the Supreme Court, and we will get some guidance from them, hopefully within the next term,\" State Rep. Dyson said.\nLeunes anticipates continued legal challenges over the issue.\n\"I know legally -- there have already been uh cases filed or filings and there will be more,\" Leunes said.\nIf not adjourned early, the second special legislative session will end no later than Sept. 13.\nHowever, some observers believe the ongoing debates could necessitate a third special session.\nThis story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

California Governor Gavin Newsom says he is fighting “fire with fire,” signing legislation to hold special elections for the public to approve a new gerrymandered map of their own. David Daley, a voting rights expert and the author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Far Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections, calls this a “gerrymandering Armageddon” that threatens to spread nationwide. “Donald Trump does not want to have an election fair and square,” says Texas state legislator Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat representing San Antonio. “He wants to be the 'commander-in-cheat.' He wants to cheat on America, cheat on democracy, steal these congressional seats.”\nTranscript\nAMY GOODMAN: California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation Thursday approving a special election in November that will ask voters to approve a new, partisan congressional map favoring Democrats. Lawmakers in Sacramento approved the measures a day after Texas’s Republican-controlled House passed a new congressional district map designed to flip five Democratic-held U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This rare instance of mid-decade redistricting came at the behest of President Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom spoke Thursday.\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM: We got here because the president of the United States is struggling. We got here because the president of the United States is one of the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history. We got here because he recognizes that he will lose the election. Congress will go back into the hands of the Democratic Party next November. We got here because of his failed policies. Those are being exposed hour by hour, reinforced today by Walmart announcing they’ll be raising prices because of the tax increases, because of the tariffs, reminded every day by a slowing economy, growing mistrust, distrust all across this nation. Across the board, he is failing. He recognized that, and that’s why he made a phone call to Greg Abbott asking for five seats — can’t win by playing by traditional sets of rules. He plays by no rules. I remind you all the time: It’s not the rule of law, it’s the rule of Don. And we’re standing up to that.\nAMY GOODMAN: We’re joined now by two guests. Trey Martinez Fischer is a Democratic Texas state representative from San Antonio. His piece for the San Antonio Express-News is headlined “To preserve democracy, Texas Democrats must fight fire with fire.” Earlier this month, he and other Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state in an attempt to block passage of the new, gerrymandered congressional maps. He’s joining us from Austin.\nAnd in Haydenville, Massachusetts, David Daley is with us, a senior fellow at FairVote, author of several books on voting, including Antidemocratic: Inside the Far Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections and Unrigged: How Americans Are Battling Back to Save Democracy.\nLet’s go first to Austin to speak with Trey Martinez Fischer. Explain what has taken place, what is taking place as we speak, in the Texas Legislature, why you fled the state to break quorum, but the fact that now the vote, one of the votes, has taken place to pass the GOP-favored gerrymandered map.\nREP. TREY MARTINEZ FISCHER: No, well, thank you for the question. Well, first, it was one of the — just historic bait and switch. As you know, in Texas, we had a horrific flood where many people lost their lives. Many lives were just upended. And the idea was, we were going to come to a special session to aid the flood relief victims, to try to make things whole. And in just really with a snap of a finger, the governor announces his intention to have a mid-decade redistricting to bring five new Republican seats in Congress, which really threw everybody off.\nWe knew from the start that we did not have the votes to stop that. And moreover, we didn’t think the country was paying attention to what was happening in Texas. So, my fellow Democrats and I, we decided to elevate this conversation, fight in the national arena, leave the state of Texas for over two weeks, you know, find refuge in Illinois under the leadership and watch Governor Pritzker. And we used our two weeks to rally the country, to wake people up and to let people know that Donald Trump does not want to have an election fair and square, that he wants to be the “commander-in-cheat.” He wants to cheat on America, cheat on democracy, steal these congressional seats.\nAnd I’m just thankful that other leaders woke up, saw what was going on, and said, “OK, if Trump is going to throw out the rule book, then we will fight fire with fire.” And I think that’s what you see in California.\nAMY GOODMAN: Did California have to do with you coming back to Texas, even though you knew that meant that they would pass the gerrymandered map?\nREP. TREY MARTINEZ FISCHER: I think what it meant is, again, you know, had we stayed in Austin and we fought this in the middle of the night, it might have made the local news. We know this is now international news. We know that people are starting to ask questions about mid-decade redistricting and gerrymandering and all of the stuff that is happening.\nAnd quite frankly, if you ask California leaders, they needed time to educate their voters, to educate their lawmakers. They needed a discussion to be on the national stage. And I think, as you saw very recently, that a poll in the state of California showed 57% of Californians agree with Governor Newsom’s plan to draw five new congressional seats in California. That doesn’t happen by osmosis. That happens by engagement and people coming together and this country rallying, because, look, I never underestimate the power of the American people when it comes to preserving and protecting our democracy.\nAMY GOODMAN: Representative Martinez Fischer, you’re serving your 12th term in the Texas House of Representatives. You’re the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus. Talk about how partisan gerrymandering relates to racial gerrymandering.\nREP. TREY MARTINEZ FISCHER: Thank you very much for the question, because that is the heart of the matter here. You know, Republicans and Donald Trump and Governor Abbott will tell you, “Well, this is nothing new here. This is just — we’re looking for partisan performance, and that is entirely legal.” Well, yes, you can draw maps for partisan performance, but you can’t do it on the backs of the minority community.\nHere’s what the maps in Texas do and how minority rights are taken away. Number one, you take districts in Texas, congressional districts like, you know, the one represented by Representative Al Green. That district is a performing district right now. It elects African Americans, even though it doesn’t have a majority of African Americans in that district. Under this plan, what has happened now, you see a concentration of voters, more than what is necessary for that map to perform, being placed in this Congressional District 18, and now, all of a sudden, you’ve just packed that district, and you’ve diluted the voice of the African American community.\nLet’s take another example. In San Antonio, where I’m from, you took a district that had a 60% Hispanic citizen voting age population, and you reduce that now to barely 50%, knowing full well, by looking at election data, that Hispanics will never, ever, ever have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. And I find that very confusing, because the narrative, at least in Texas, is that Hispanics are trending Republican. If they’re trending Republican, why do you shrink the numbers so low that you know Hispanics’ voice will never be heard? And to do this, the way it’s done in Texas is they cut precincts. And that’s a little bit into the weeds, but you look at this map, and over 400 precincts were cut. You can’t cut a precinct by accident. You are laser-focused, looking for people you want to keep, getting rid of those you don’t. And that’s how you rig an election, and that’s how you decide an outcome before the first vote is cast.\nAMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you something. Could this backfire on the Republicans? Because you take very safe Republican districts, and you have to absorb more Democrats to take away the power of the Democratic districts. But could this possibly backfire?\nREP. TREY MARTINEZ FISCHER: I think it could backfire. And I think that’s why you saw the Republican legislative leader in California say that he’s not a fan of mid-decade redistricting. I think he even said, “When you fight fire with fire, you end up burning the whole place down.” I do believe that Republicans are at risk, but I think that that is a risk worth taking for President Trump, because the other side of the coin is maybe a Democratic House of Representatives that gets to ask questions of the executive branch, that has subpoena power, that has investigative power, probably a lot of risk for the president, and he’d rather give up his own Republicans in Congress just to protect his backside. And that will show you, you know, what the stakes are and what he will do to win this election.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to bring David Daley into this conversation, David Daley, who wrote the book Undemocratic — Antidemocratic: Inside the Far Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections, senior fellow at FairVote. Talk about this redistricting war. We’re seeing what’s happening in Texas, what’s happened in now California, but this doesn’t stop with these two states.\nDAVID DALEY: That’s exactly right, Amy. We are in the midst of a gerrymandering Armageddon. And it’s going to start in Texas, spread to California, but it’s not going to stop there. And that’s really the challenge that Democrats face right now, because it’s entirely possible that the Texas and California gerrymanders will cancel each other out. Now, both of these two redistrictings in the middle of the decade would be the most extreme manipulation of electoral maps in modern American history. But it’s not going to stop there. This is about to spread to Republican-controlled maps in Ohio, in Indiana, in Missouri, in Florida, where Ron DeSantis has said he’s looking at as many as five additional districts. I don’t think he can get that many, but certainly two or three more in Florida. If Republicans want to keep going, they could go to Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire.\nThe problem for Democrats is that they have essentially maxed out the places where they can gain additional seats. In New York, Governor Hochul talking tough, talking about declaring war, but this is a war that she can’t enter until 2028 because of the state’s constitutional prohibitions on mid-decade redistricting. In Illinois, Governor Pritzker already signed a pretty gerrymandered 14-Democrat, three-Republican map back in 2021. It’d be very difficult to squeeze out another Democratic seat there. In Maryland, in Oregon, I don’t think there’s a lot left on this map for Democrats to claim.\nRepublicans have got a lot more targets out there. This isn’t going to stop. And it could get even worse next year, if the U.S. Supreme Court, as we imagine, eliminates protections on majority-minority seats, shreds the remaining pieces of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and allows Southern states, like South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, to go after majority-Black seats. This is the Callais case from Louisiana that the court will hear on October 15th. There’s lots and lots of danger ahead here. If Democrats think it’s going to be easy to take back the House in 2026, Republicans are doing everything they can to boost their chances before a vote is cast.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go back to this issue, David Daley, of political gerrymandering, which is allowed, partisan gerrymandering, and racial gerrymandering, which is not allowed. And if you can explain more fully the role of the Supreme Court, and particularly the chief justice, John Roberts?\nDAVID DALEY: Yes. And I think that that really is the particular bitterness of this situation, is that we don’t have to be here. We are here, in many ways, because John Roberts and the U.S. Supreme Court closed the federal courts to partisan gerrymandering claims back in 2019. This is a case from North Carolina called Rucho v. Common Cause.\nAnd what John Roberts said is that gerrymandering is just politics as usual, right? Now what we’re seeing in Texas, the most extreme manipulation of maps in modern American history, that’s just politics as usual, says the chief justice. And he said this at a time when federal courts, judges appointed by presidents of both parties, were looking at maps drawn by both parties, by Democrats in Maryland, by Republicans in Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina. And they said, “We have all the tools we need to go ahead and fix this.” Roberts not only said no, but he closed the federal courts forever to these claims.\nSo, what he did was he unleashed, he incentivized the kinds of gerrymanders we saw back in 2021. He allowed for what is happening right now. He left voters completely naked in the face of these partisan power grabs. The Supreme Court really failed the country here.\nAnd I think it’s worth pointing out that if Republicans had not stolen that seat, given — that the Democrats were able to appoint back in 2016, that this entire thing turns out much differently right now. That case comes out differently. What has happened at the U.S. Supreme Court has accelerated and incentivized this entire anti-voter summer that we are seeing right now.\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go to another issue, David. President Trump said Monday he’ll soon sign an executive order to ban voting by mail, calling the long-standing practice a “fraud.” Writing on social media, Trump also said he planned to target, quote, “Highly 'Inaccurate,' Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES,” unquote. Trump’s pledge came just days after he made these comments to Fox News, following his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, Vladimir Putin said something, one of the most interesting things. He said, “Your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting.”\nAMY GOODMAN: So, you have President Trump saying that Putin told him that his election is rigged because they have mail-in voting. Can you talk about the significance of banning mail-in ballots in this country?\nDAVID DALEY: Donald Trump cannot ban mail-in ballots. Our elections are regulated by the states. Donald Trump does not have this power. He cannot get that done. And I think the silence that you are seeing from Republican officials in states make that clear. Mail-in balloting is the way elections in many, many states, especially out West, are conducted. Donald Trump has voted by mail most of his life. Republicans have been very good over the years at generating mail-in ballots.\nThis is a distraction. This is an effort by the president to do what he does here, right? He likes to suggest that elections are not corrupt when he wins, and the ones he loses have all sorts of problems. This is an attempt ahead of the election to try to sow doubt among his followers that it will be free and fair. We do not have a problem with voter fraud in this country, with mail-in ballot fraud. Whenever they make these arguments, they are unable to find actually any examples at all that they can point to here.\nThe bigger challenge, I think, is that what we are seeing in Washington, D.C., right now could play out around the country in Democratic cities on Election Day in 2026, right? If what we are seeing in Washington is a dry run for what we could see in Philadelphia or Atlanta, Milwaukee, Detroit — National Guard and ICE troops, masked, on the streets, trying to intimidate voters — that, to me, is something very concerning and that we ought to be thinking about right now.\nAMY GOODMAN: Daley, about things we should be talking about, now the issue is gerrymandering. The issue is mail-in ballots. But issues that you focused on, like ranked-choice voting, that led to the Democratic candidate in the mayoral election this year, Zohran Mamdani, the popular electoral vote, where do these stand today?\nDAVID DALEY: There is, I think, a greater awareness than ever that what we need on redistricting, especially, is a national solution to a national problem, right? If we’re going to keep going state by state, what happens is, you know, Texas does something lousy like this, and it reverberates. It has consequences across the entire country, because Texas’s map does not stay in Texas. Republicans have a three-seat advantage in Congress, and so if you grab an additional five seats there, it has a ripple effect. What we need is a national solution.\nAnd I think the very best one would be a much more proportional House, along the lines of the Fair Representation Act that Jamie Raskin and Don Beyer have proposed. You can learn much more about this at FairVote.org. But really, the solution here would be to go to larger multimember districts that can’t be gerrymandered because the district lines no longer choose winners and losers, and to use ranked-choice voting within those districts. You would then see that every district in America becomes a swing district. Right now in this country, only 37 of 435 congressional seats were competitive in the 2024 election. That’s no way to run a democracy. When you look around the world, we would call nations where more than 90% of elections are noncompetitive something much different than a healthy, functioning democracy. So —\nAMY GOODMAN: And we’re going to do more on national popular vote, as well as ranked-choice voting —\nDAVID DALEY: Absolutely.\nAMY GOODMAN: — in the coming months. But I want to end with Texas Democratic state Representative Trey Martinez Fischer. House Democrats will sue to block the gerrymandered map once it’s signed. But won’t this process take too long to matter right now?\nREP. TREY MARTINEZ FISCHER: You know, I’m not so sure. Like, you know, again, filing for office in Texas begins in November. There’s lots of work to be done by the secretary of state, local election officials. And so, I think when this — when this map finds itself in court, I don’t think time is on the side of President Trump and Governor Abbott. And I think a federal panel, you know, might step in and tap the brakes on this. Now, understand, we are still fighting over maps that were passed in 2021, maps, I would argue, that Republicans said were perfectly fine and weren’t racially gerrymandered. So we have an ongoing fight under the current districts. Now we’re going to bring a new map and add an additional fight on top of that. I think that might be too much to bear for election officials. And so, if the brakes are tapped, maybe we’ll end up running in the current districts, which I think will be very competitive. And so, then, all of this work will be for naught. But I don’t think we sit on the sidelines. We do not have that luxury. We have to fight with every tool that we have, from quorum breaks to legislative floor fights to fighting at the courthouse, because I do believe, while we may lose the votes in the Capitol, we are all equal in federal court.\nAMY GOODMAN: And this latest news: The longtime Democratic Congressmember Lloyd Doggett says if the gerrymandered maps are approved, he will not run again. He would be running against the head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Greg Casar.\nTrey Martinez Fischer, Democratic Texas state representative for San Antonio, thank you so much for joining us from Texas’ capital of Austin, and David Daley, author of Antidemocratic: Inside the Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections, senior fellow at FairVote.\nComing up, a Democracy Now! broadcast exclusive.

      "text": "Texas nears final vote on new congressional maps as redistricting race escalates\nThe Texas Senate could vote Friday to approve new congressional maps drawn to help Republicans win as many as five more House seats in next year’s midterm elections.\nIt’s the final legislative hurdle for the redistricting plan sought by President Donald Trump and Gov. Greg Abbott — one that ignited an intensifying, nationwide redistricting arms race.\nCalifornia Democrats responded to the Texas effort on Thursday by approving their own new congressional maps, a Gov. Gavin Newsom-led bid to nullify the GOP’s gains in Texas by handing Democrats five more favorable House districts.\nNewsom’s plan will require another significant step: In California, where voters took the power to draw congressional maps away from lawmakers in 2010, implementing the Democrats’ new maps will require the state to hold an election on Nov. 4 in which voters will be asked to approve a constitutional amendment to override the lines drawn by the state’s independent redistricting commission.\nThe race to redistrict — a process that typically only takes place once a decade, after the completion of the U.S. Census — is likely to expand in the coming weeks. The White House is looking to Ohio, where a quirk of state law requires the legislature to approve new maps this year, as well as Missouri, Florida, Indiana and South Carolina, where the party is in full control of the state governments, as avenues to add more favorable districts. Democratic governors in Illinois, Maryland and New York have also floated redrawing their maps to add more Democratic-leaning districts.\n“Game on,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on X Wednesday after the Texas House passed its new maps.\nMid-decade redistricting is unusual, and state lawmakers aren’t being coy about why they are doing so now. Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, the Republican who sponsored the new congressional map in the House, said during a floor debate Wednesday that he did so “to give Republicans an opportunity where they haven’t in the past.”\nCalifornia state Sen. Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat, said during a floor debate Thursday that Republicans “started this madness.”\n“Republicans are trying to cheat to win congressional midterm elections under their unpopular president, and Democrats are fighting back. This is about trying to level the national playing field so we can have something close to fair elections for Congress in 2026,” Blakespear said.\nTexas awaits Senate vote\nIn Texas, the Republican-dominated state Senate still must approve the redistricting plan before it heads to Abbott’s desk to be signed into law. The Senate adjourned Thursday night without voting on the new maps, and is scheduled to reconvene at 10 a.m. CT Friday.\nHowever, the drama largely seemed to end Monday, when Democratic House members who had fled the state for 15 days to deny the House the two-thirds quorum it needs to do business returned to Austin.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows sought to prevent Democrats from leaving the state again on Monday by locking the chamber doors and requiring the Democrats who had boycotted to sign permission slips agreeing to be escorted by a Department of Public Safety officer who would return them when the House reconvened Wednesday. State Rep. Nicole Collier refused and remained on the House floor for two nights; more Democrats ripped up their permission slips and joined her for the second night.\nThose Democrats vowed Wednesday night, minutes after the House’s 88-52 party-line vote, to wage a legal battle against the new congressional maps.\n“This fight is far from over,” said state Rep. Gene Wu, the House Democratic leader. “Our best shot is in the courts.”\nBefore they’ve even been signed into law, the new maps are already reshaping the midterm landscape. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who represents what’s now the 37th District, said he would not seek reelection if the new maps are upheld by courts. His retirement would stave off a potentially bruising primary against another Democratic congressman, Rep. Greg Casar, whose current district would be retooled to favor Republicans under the new proposed maps.\nCalifornia voters have final say\nUnlike the Texas redistricting bill, which required no constitutional amendment, the California effort moved in three parts. One bill is the constitutional amendment; another funds the November 4 election; and another includes the maps themselves. All three passed both chambers of the legislature on Thursday on largely party-line votes.\nThe California redistricting plan will only take effect if voters approve the amendment of the state’s constitution in that November election to temporarily replace the state’s independent redistricting commission’s House maps with new Democratic maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\nCalifornia Republicans have long acknowledged that their best chance of blocking the redistricting effort is by defeating it at the ballot box. A coalition of gerrymandering opponents and Republican leaders has already started to form to defeat the initiative, known as Proposition 50. State and national Democrats are also preparing to defend the initiative.\nNewsom argued that California’s effort is “in stark contrast to what you’re seeing in Texas,” because voters must sign off before the new districts can take effect.\n“I signed the first bill ever signed by a governor of any state in U.S. history that will place in front of the voters maps for their determination. It’s the most democratic redistricting effort that has been advanced,” he said in a livestream with supporters Thursday.\nThe plan from California Democrats initially included a trigger to only take effect if another state engaged in mid-decade redistricting, but that provision was removed on Thursday, one day after the Texas House passed the GOP-drawn congressional maps.\n“Because Texas Republicans have voted,” the trigger language “is no longer necessary,” Nick Miller, communications director for Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, said in a statement."

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Republicans were aiming Friday to give final passage to an unprecedented mid-decade redraw of the state’s congressional map and send it to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk for final approval ahead of the 2026 elections.\nDebate in the GOP-controlled Senate stretched into Friday afternoon, as Democrats attempted to delay the bill’s passage. On Friday afternoon, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, announced that she would be filibustering the measure.\n\"Most people thought today would mark the end of the fight against Trump's power grab. But I'm here to tell you that we're just getting started,\" Alvarado said in a statement. \"I am standing up to Trump and standing for our democracy.\"\nThis isn't the first time Alvarado has filibustered against Republican-led election efforts. In 2021, she spoke for 15 hours and 7 minutes against a voting-restrictions bill, which passed after the marathon speech. Alvarado stood and spoke without food or water during that time.\n\"Now the stakes are even higher, and I'm prepared to give everything I have for my fellow Texans and for this country,\" Alvarado said.\nEarlier in the day, Democrats spent hours pressing state Sen. Phil King, the measure's sponsor, on the legality of the proposal, with many alleging that the redrawn districts violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting voters’ influence based on race — an accusation King vehemently denied.\n“I had two goals in mind: That all maps would be legal and would be better for Republican congressional candidates in Texas,” said King.\nCalifornia Democrats landed their counterpunch to Texas on Thursday, just a day after Texas Republicans advanced their redrawn map that had come at the urging of President Donald Trump with the aim of padding their House majority by five seats.\nLawmakers in California voted mostly along party lines to approve legislation calling for a special election in November to approve a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more U.S. House seats next year. California's map needs voter approval because, unlike in Texas, a nonpartisan commission normally draws the map to avoid the sort of political battle that is playing out.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who rallied Democrats in his state to counter Texas’ initial moves, quickly signed the special election bill. If Republicans in Texas finalize their map Friday, Abbott is expected to follow suit.\nThe back-and-forth between the two states marks the starkest escalation yet in an emerging redistricting war, with both parties openly redrawing congressional lines to lock in power ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nAbbott on Friday called California's redistricting “a joke” and said that while Texas' new map is constitutional, he claimed California's would be overturned.\nNewsom said Thursday that the measure “is a reaction to an assault on our democracy in Texas,” and pledged a campaign that would reach out to Democrats, Republicans and independent voters.\n“This is not something six weeks ago that I ever imagined that I’d be doing,” he said.\nCalifornia Republicans have sued and called for a federal investigation. They promise to fight the measure at the ballot box as well.\nCalifornia Assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, said Trump was “wrong” to push for new Republican seats elsewhere, contending the president was responding to Democratic gerrymandering in other states. But he warned that Newsom’s approach, which the governor has dubbed “fight fire with fire,” was dangerous.\n“You move forward fighting fire with fire and what happens?” Gallagher asked. “You burn it all down.”\nA battle for the U.S. House control waged via redistricting\nOn a national level, the partisan makeup of existing districts puts Democrats within three seats of a majority. The incumbent president’s party usually loses congressional seats in the midterms.\nThe Texas redraw is already reshaping the 2026 race, with Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the dean of Texas’ congressional delegation, announcing Thursday that he will not seek reelection to his Austin-based seat if the new Republican-drawn map takes effect. Under the proposed map, Doggett's district would overlap with another Democratic incumbent, Rep. Greg Casar.\nThe president has pushed other Republican-controlled states including Indiana and Missouri to also revise their maps to add more winnable GOP seats. Ohio Republicans were also already scheduled to revise their maps to make them more partisan.\n“Republicans are not finished in the United States,” Abbott said Friday.\nRedistricting typically occurs once a decade, immediately after a census. While some states have their own limitations, there is no national impediment to a state trying to redraw districts in the middle of the decade.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has said the Constitution does not outlaw partisan gerrymandering, only using race to redraw district lines.\n“What is allowed by the Supreme Court is drawing (districts) for political reasons,” Abbott said. \"These were drawn by Republicans for political reasons to assure that Republicans would have better representation in Congress.”\nDemocrats have sought a national commission for redistricting\nRepublicans and some Democrats championed the 2008 ballot measure that established California’s nonpartisan redistricting commission, along with the 2010 one that extended its role to drawing congressional maps.\nNewsom, who backed the initial redistricting commission ballot measures, contended his state was still setting a model.\n“We’ll be the first state in U.S. history, in the most democratic way, to submit to the people of our state the ability to determine their own maps,” Newsom said before signing the legislation.\nFormer President Barack Obama, who has also backed a nationwide nonpartisan approach, has also backed Newsom’s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was necessary to stave off the GOP’s Texas move.\nMore Democratic-run states have commission systems like California’s or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can’t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.\nEarlier this month, outnumbered Texas Democrats left the state for 15 days to block a vote. Once they returned, they were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring."

The redistricting plan then goes to Gov.

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas House on Wednesday approved redrawn congressional maps that would give Republicans a bigger edge in 2026, muscling through a partisan gerrymander that launched weeks of protests by Democrats and a widening national battle over redistricting.\nThe approval came at the urging of President Donald Trump, who pushed for the extraordinary mid-decade revision of congressional maps to give his party a better chance at holding onto the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. The maps, which would give Republicans five more winnable seats, need to be approved by the GOP-controlled state Senate and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott before they become official.\nBut the Texas House vote had presented the best chance for Democrats to derail the redraw.\nDemocratic legislators delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing Texas earlier this month in protest, and they were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday’s session.\nThe approval of the Texas maps on an 88-52 party-line vote is likely to prompt California’s Democratic-controlled state Legislature this week to approve of a new House map creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. But the California map would require voter approval in November.\nDemocrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.\nTexas maps openly made to help GOP\nTexas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party’s interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said on the floor. After nearly eight hours of debate, Hunter took the floor again to sum up the entire dispute as nothing more than a partisan fight. “What’s the difference, to the whole world listening? Republicans like it, and Democrats do not.”\nDemocrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship.\n“In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” State Rep. Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, D.C., choose their voters.”\nState Rep. John H. Bucy blamed the president. “This is Donald Trump’s map,” Bucy said. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\nRedistricting becomes tool nationwide in battle for US House\nThe Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state’s map to create five new Democratic seats.\n“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.”\nA new California map would need to be approved by voters in a special election in November because that state normally operates with a nonpartisan commission drawing the map to avoid the very sort of political brawl that is playing out. Newsom himself backed the 2008 ballot measure to create that process, as did former President Barack Obama. But in a sign of Democrats’ stiffening resolve, Obama Tuesday night backed Newsom’s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP’s Texas move.\n“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party’s main redistricting arm.\nThe incumbent president’s party usually loses seats in the midterm election, and the GOP currently controls the House of Representatives by a mere three votes. Trump is going beyond Texas in his push to remake the map. He’s pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to create new Republican seats. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland’s and New York’s maps as well.\nHowever, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California’s or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can’t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.\nTexas Democrats decry the new maps\nIn Texas, there was little that outnumbered Democrats could do other than fume and threaten a lawsuit to block the map. Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.\nDemocrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas’ legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up.\nRepublicans contend the new map creates more new majority-minority seats than the previous one. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state’s House seats that will be represented by a Black representative.\nState Rep. Ron Reynolds noted the country just marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act’s passage and warned GOP members about how they’d be remembered if they voted for what he called “this racial gerrymander.”\n“Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in the body this day,” Reynolds, a Democrat, said.\nRepublicans hit back at criticism\nRepublicans spent far less time talking on Wednesday, content to let their numbers do the talking in the lopsided vote. As the day dragged on, a handful hit back against Democratic complaints.\n“You call my voters racist, you call my party racist and yet we’re expected to follow the rules,” said State Rep. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson. “There are Black and Hispanic and Asian Republicans in this chamber who were elected just like you.”\nHouse Republicans’ frustration at the Democrats’ flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable. The GOP used a parliamentary maneuver to take a second and final vote on the map so it wouldn’t have to reconvene for one more vote after Senate approval.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip. The doors were only unlocked after final passage more than eight hours later. One Democrat who refused the 24-hour police monitoring, State Rep. Nicole Collier, had been confined to the House floor since Monday night.\nSome Democratic state lawmakers joined Collier Tuesday night for what Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez dubbed “a sleepover for democracy.”\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust several Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent."

      "text": "Trump backed a scramble to redraw congressional seats in Texas. Michigan ‘not engaging’\n- Redistricting usually happens every ten years, but a mid-decade fight over congressional maps before the 2026 election is underway.\n- Michigan has an independent redistricting process, and it would require a constitutional amendment to change it.\n- In Michigan's divided state government, it's highly unlikely lawmakers would come together to try to take back control of the redistricting process.\nMichigan is a political battleground, but the state will likely stay out of the redistricting war threatening to upend the congressional map ahead of the 2026 midterm election.\nIn fact, Michigan's swing state status has yielded divided state government, essentially taking it out of a fight in which one-party rule is a kind of precondition for participation.\nThe process of drawing new voting districts typically happens once every 10 years following the decennial census. But a mid-decade redistricting shake-up began when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, called a special legislative session to redraw congressional districts in his state. President Donald Trump has expressed his hope that new lines will allow Republicans to pick up five more seats for Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has moved ahead with a plan to suspend the map drawn by his state's independent redistricting commission to ask voters to adopt lines that favor Democrats.\nMichigan has a redistricting commission similar to the one in California. Independent redistricting advocates have railed against politically skewed voting districts designed to benefit one political party, describing such gerrymandering as a way to distort election outcomes by letting politicians choose their voters instead of the other way around. In Michigan, voters passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 that wrested control of the redistricting process from lawmakers and put the pen in the hands of a group of randomly selected voters charged with drawing fair maps.\nSeveral factors mean Michigan is all but guaranteed to stay on the sidelines of the battle to control Congress by changing the map: legal safeguards protecting Michigan's citizen-led redistricting process, the partisan makeup of the state's Legislature, election timelines and a general disinterest among politicians to interfere.\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said she has no interest in redrawing the lines. \"We're not changing any maps in Michigan,\" she told reporters Aug. 20. \"What's going on in Texas I think is an affront to democracy, and so it's understandable that you've got other states starting to have similar conversations about what's possible. We're not engaging in that here in Michigan.\"\nWhile the leaders of both major political parties in the state may not agree on much, they have one thing in common: neither is clamoring to see a new congressional map put in place before the 2030 census triggers the next redistricting cycle.\nMichigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel condemned Texas Republicans' redistricting push as a power grab and applauded Democratic governors for trying to fight the map with their own efforts to change their state's congressional districts. But Hertel said he's not calling on Michigan Democrats to try to follow in their footsteps, and he expressed pride in the redistricting process approved by Michigan voters to create fair maps. \"I don't want to go back,\" he said.\nIt also wasn't top of mind for Michigan GOP Chair state Sen. Jim Runestad, R-White Lake, who said he wanted to do more research on the redistricting fight playing out in Texas before commenting. In a follow-up call, Runestad characterized Newsom's redistricting push as a partisan endeavor in contrast to Texas, where he said lawmakers seemed to be focused on addressing concerns the U.S. Department of Justice raised about how their congressional map divided voters of color into different voting districts. Critics have characterized the department's allegations as a kind of pretext for partisan gerrymandering in Texas.\nEven if Michigan politicians wanted to try to take back control of the redistricting process now, they would have a steep hill to climb. Changing the process in Michigan would require an amendment to the state's constitution.\nWith the support of two-thirds of members in both chambers of the Michigan Legislature, lawmakers could put forward a constitutional amendment asking voters to change the redistricting process again. But Michigan Democrats control the Michigan Senate while Republicans control the Michigan House, a composition that makes it highly unlikely lawmakers would come together across party lines to agree to such an amendment.\nMichigan voters could also propose a constitutional amendment, but no campaign has emerged to put redistricting back on the ballot to ask voters to essentially dismantle the redistricting process that they put in place. Even if it did, voters wouldn't have a chance to take it up until the November 2026 election.\nChristy McGillivray, who serves as executive director of Voters Not Politicians, which spearheaded the anti-gerrymandering campaign in Michigan, said she has faith that Michigan voters want to stick with a citizen-led, independent redistricting process, saying fairness is a principle that brings them together despite their political differences. \"They're even-keeled and the current hyper-partisanship coming from the federal government doesn't reflect the majority of Michiganders. It really doesn't,\" she said.\nLike California and Texas, many of the other states that could become entangled in the mid-decade redistricting war are solidly Republican or solidly Democratic states. Michigan, meanwhile, has a competitive political geography.\nThe state's congressional map features some of the most highly contested districts in the U.S.\nPolitical operatives see a path to gerrymander Michigan voting districts to favor one political party. \"It would be easy to do,\" said Jeff Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director who helped draw voting districts to favor Republicans before voters put an independent redistricting process in place.\nBut Timmer also said that the state's map creates some obstacles to such an attempt. Someone could draw a map that makes the state's competitive congressional districts slightly more Republican- or Democratic-leaning, but he likened that to stepping on a balloon. For instance, a mapper couldn't make a competitive seat in Oakland County and still have one in Macomb County, Timmer said.\nAn attempt to gerrymander wouldn't provide the \"clear, decisive, slam dunk\" for partisans in Michigan like it does in California or Texas, he said.\nContact Clara Hendrickson at chendrickson@freepress.com or 313-296-5743."

      "text": "Democratic state Representative Nicole Collier refused to come to the Texas state Capitol for two weeks. After returning on August 18 she refused to leave, and fellow Democrats joined her protest.\nCollier was among dozens of Democrats who left the state for the Democratic havens of California, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York to delay the Republican-controlled Legislature’s approval of redrawn congressional districts demanded by Donald Trump.\nWhen they returned on August 18, Republicans insisted that Democrats have around-the-clock police surveillance and escorts to ensure they wouldn’t leave again and scuttle the August 20 House vote on a new political map.\nBut Collier wouldn’t sign what Democrats called the “permission slip” needed to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them.\nShe spent August 18 and 19 on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.\n“I refuse to sign. I will not agree to be in custody. I’m not a criminal. I am exercising my right to resist and oppose the decisions of our government. So this is my form of protest,” said Collier. “My constituents sent me to Austin to protect their voices and rights. I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police escorts.”\nShe noted that police officers following Democratic lawmakers were not on the beat, and suggested that the loss made the public less safe.\nCollier also filed a writ of habeas corpus to force the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Texas House of Representatives to end her “illegal confinement” immediately.\nTexas Democrats noted that being held hostage is defined as being kept somewhere against your will, under threat or coercion, to force a specific outcome. In this case, Democratic lawmakers were physically monitored, denied free movement, and subjected to police surveillance not because of any crime, but to guarantee their presence for a high-stakes redistricting vote.\nThe use of law enforcement to restrict the mobility of elected officials — not for safety, but for political leverage — matches the definition of a hostage situation: confinement used as leverage to extract compliance.\nDallas-area Representative Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.\n“It’s a weird feeling,” she said. “The only way to explain the entire process is: It’s like I’m in a movie.”\nThe trooper assignments, ordered by Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows, was another escalation of a redistricting battle that has widened across the country. Trump is pushing GOP state officials to rig the map for the 2026 midterms more in his favor to preserve the GOP’s slim House majority, and Democrats nationally have rallied around efforts to retaliate.\nThe first domino in that escalating national redistricting battle fell on August 20, as the Republican-controlled Texas legislature passed a new congressional map creating five new winnable seats for the GOP.\nUnder pressure from a deeply unpopular president to rig the 2026 elections to keep MAGA Republicans in power, the Texas governor called the Texas legislature into a special session to essentially hijack congressional district maps to create five new Republican-dominated districts.\nFurious national Democrats have vowed payback for the Texas map, with California’s legislature poised to approve new maps adding more Democratic-friendly seats later this week. The map would still need to be approved by that state’s voters in November.\nNormally, states redraw maps once a decade with new census figures. But Trump is lobbying other conservative-controlled states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to squeeze new GOP-friendly seats out of their maps as his party prepares for a difficult midterm election next year.\nOTHER DEMOCRATS JOIN THE PROTEST\nTexas state senator Roland Gutierrez posted a video of people outside the chamber chanting “Let Her Go!” to social media with the heading: “This is full-on authoritarianism.”\n“This is the kind of bullsh*t that’s happening right now in the Texas legislature. Dustin Burrows has locked up Nicole Collier because she won’t sign some bullsh*t permission slip to be followed around by a DPS escort—that’s a cop following around for the next three weeks to make sure that she comes in and votes for this bullsh*t Donald Trump redistricting bill,” he said in the video. “What’s going on in Texas is absolutely 100% wrong and locking up members of the legislature because they won’t sign your bullsh*t document: it’s just wrong. It’s wrong. We need more people up here fighting. We need more people up here fighting alongside state representative Nicole Collier who’s doing this protest because she must. And we all must. We must fight against Donald Trump and all of this madness that’s happening in this country and fight against his constant grab for power in the United States.”\nHouse Minority Leader Gene Wu, from Houston, and state Representative Vincel Perez, of El Paso, stayed with Collier on August 18, who represents a minority-majority district in Fort Worth.\nOn August 19, more Democrats returned to the Capitol to tear up the slips they had signed and stay on the House floor, which has a lounge and restrooms for members.\nDallas-area Representative Cassandra Garcia Hernandez, called their protest a “slumber party for democracy” and said Democrats were holding strategy sessions on the floor.\n“We are not criminals,” Houston Representative Penny Morales Shaw said.\nCollier said having officers shadow her was an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her movements.\nTHE GOP WANTS 5 MORE SEATS IN TEXAS\nThe GOP gerrymandering plan is designed to send five additional Republicans from Texas to the U.S. House. Republicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state on August 3, and Republican Governor Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust Wu and several other Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.\nHOW OFFICERS SHADOWED DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS\nDemocrats reported different levels of monitoring. Houston Rep. Armando Walle said he wasn’t sure where his police escort was, but there was still a heightened police presence in the Capitol, so he felt he was being monitored closely.\nSome Democrats said the officers watching them were friendly. But Austin Rep. Sheryl Cole said in a social media post that when she went on her morning walk Tuesday, the officer following her lost her on the trail, got angry and threatened to arrest her.\nGarcia said her 9-year-old son was with her as she drove home, and each time she looked in the rearview mirror, she could see the officer close behind. He came inside a grocery store where she shopped with her son.\n“I would imagine that this is the way it feels when you’re potentially shoplifting and someone is assessing whether you’re going to steal,” she said."

The measure was approved along party lines, 88-52, the Texas Tribune reports. The Republican-controlled Senate can now take up the plan with days, approve it, and to Gov. Greg Abbott for his signature. Trump told Texas Republicans in a social media post on Tuesday to approve the map \"ASAP,\" per the Washington Post.\nApproval could set off similar redistricting battles in other states, per the New York Times. Democrats pointed out Wednesday that the congressional map was the first piece of legislation the House was deciding on—not any of the bills responding to the fatal floods last month in the state's Hill Country. Several Democrats wore dark green in honor of the flood victims. The sponsor of the new map, Rep. Todd Hunter, told the House that it's legal for Republicans to redistrict in the middle of a decade for partisan gain. \"The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,\" Hunter said.\nDemocrats proposed 12 amendments to the legislation, all of which Republicans voted down. They included blocking enactment of the new map until the Trump administration releases the Jeffrey Epstein files, an independent redistricting commission is established, and a federal court rules the plan did not suppress the vote of people of color. Given the GOP's slim majority in the US House, similar redistricting in other states could mean the midterms will effectively be decided before any votes are cast, per the Times."

      "text": "The controversial tactic both sides are using ahead of pivotal midterms for Trump presidency\nTexas and California are looking to redraw their congressional maps before the 2026 midterm elections, as Republicans and Democrats seek to shore up support. The controversial move is known as redistricting - here's everything you need to know.\nFriday 22 August 2025 05:34, UK\nLegislators in Texas have approved new congressional maps designed to boost Donald Trump's Republicans at next year's midterm elections.\nKnown as redistricting, the state's re-drawn map would shift conservative voters into districts currently held by Democrats, and combine other districts with a Democratic majority into one.\nThe process is not new, and is completely legal - unless it is ruled to be racially motivated - but typically occurs every 10 years after the US Census to account for population changes.\nThe push to redistrict early came from Mr Trump himself, who wants to bolster his chances of preserving the slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives at next year's crucial midterms.\nBut by trying to re-draw the maps in the red state of Texas, Democrats have lined up their own counter redistricting effort in the blue state of California.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom - who has led opposition against Mr Trump - has legislation teeing up a special election on a new congressional map which, if approved by voters later this year, stands to give Democrats five more seats.\nIf more states decide to re-consider their maps, it has the potential to largely determine the outcome of the 2026 midterms, before a single vote is cast.\nWhat's happening in Texas?\nMr Trump first said he wanted politicians in Texas to redraw the state's congressional district in July. The governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, followed up on the president's demands, calling for a special session to vote on new maps.\n\"Please pass this map ASAP,\" Mr Trump urged on his Truth Social platform on Monday. \"Thank you, Texas!\"\nIn an effort to try to make passing the vote as difficult as possible, Democrats fled the state for two weeks. Per parliamentary rules, if enough Democrats refuse to take part in the special session, the Texas House can't meet.\nOn their return, each Democratic politician was assigned a police escort to ensure they attended the session.\nNicole Collier, who refused the police escort, stayed in the House for two nights, and was pictured with an eye mask and blanket trying to sleep at her desk.\nOnce the debate started, the doors to the chamber were locked and all members wanting to leave had to get a permission slip to do so.\nAfter nearly eight hours, the legislation to formally change the map was passed 88-52 on Wednesday.\nIt now needs to be approved by the Texas Senate, where Republicans hold a majority, and then signed off by Mr Abbott, who has already committed to doing just that.\nWhy re-draw maps?\nRepublicans in Texas have openly said the rally to re-draw congressional maps is in the party's interest.\nTodd Hunter, the Republican who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, told the House: \"The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance.\"\nHe said the dispute is nothing more than a partisan fight, and made reference to the US Supreme Court having previously allowed politicians to redraw districts for partisan purposes.\nRead more from Sky News:\nTrump sets red line on Ukraine\nTrump risks 'very big mistake' with Putin\nDemocrats hit back, arguing the disagreement was about more than partisanship.\n\"In a democracy, people choose their representatives,\" representative Chris Turner said. \"This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, DC, choose their voters.\"\nAnother Democrat, John H Bucy, blamed the president, saying: \"This is Donald Trump's map.\n\"It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.\"\nHow have Democrats responded?\nThe move by Republicans triggered a tit-for-tat move by the Democrats in California. On Thursday, a day after the Texas plans were signed off, the state's legislature approved its own redistricting package.\nUnlike in Texas, though, the change - to give the Democrats five more seats - does need voter approval in a special election later this year, to be held on 4 November.\nMr Newsom has said it's time to \"fight fire with fire\" to take on the Republicans. His plan has gained support from former president Barack Obama, who said it was necessary to \"stave off\" the Republicans' move in Texas.\nUnder Mr Newsom's emergency legislation, the proposed California map would last only through 2030, after which the state's commission would draw up a new map for the normal, once-a-decade redistricting.\nAs the bill was signed by the governor, the state's Republican minority leader, assemblyman James Gallagher, cautioned against Mr Newsom's approach.\nWhile he said Trump was \"wrong\" to push for new Republican seats elsewhere, he added: \"You move forward fighting fire with fire and what happens? You burn it all down.\"\nCould this affect the midterms?\nThe midterms in November next year will likely be on a knife edge.\nWhatever the outcome, it could shape the remainder of Mr Trump's second term in office. A Democrat majority would make it tougher for him to pass laws.\nCurrently, Republicans control the House of Representatives in Washington, 219-212 (excluding four open vacancies). A party needs 218 seats for a majority.\nIn the Senate, the Republicans hold a similarly slim majority of 53 to 45.\nHowever, the incumbent president's party typically loses seats in the midterms.\nIn the 2018 midterms, during Mr Trump's first tenure as president, the Democrats took control of the House. Likewise, in 2022, when Joe Biden was president, the House swung back to the Republicans.\nIt's important to note that 27 House seats will remain in states that are unlikely to redraw their maps, according to The New York Times.\nIn a bid to avoid a repeat of history, Mr Trump is pushing for redistricting in states beyond Texas. Top Republicans in states like Indiana, Missouri, and Florida continue to talk about tweaking their maps to create more Republican-controlled congressional seats.\nWhile Ohio has to legally redraw, the timing of which could benefit the Republicans, and, by extension, Mr Trump."

The move was made ahead of the 2026 primary election, at the direction of President Donald Trump's Justice Department.\nThey were able to pass the maps after Texas Democrats returned from Illinois, a move that had prevented the state's special session from having a quorum.\nThe New York Times reported that the debate about the bill took more than eight hours. The final vote fell along party lines, 88-52. The Texas Senate is expected to vote on the maps on Thursday evening, and Gov. Greg Abbott could sign them into law as early as Friday, according to the NYT.\nDemocrats from across the country responded to the news on social media.\n\"It’s on, Texas,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a post on X.\n\"Game on,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul posted on X.\n\"See you in court, @GregAbbott_TX,\" Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX) posted on X.\n\"Disgraceful,\" Ray Reed, a state Democratic lawmaker in Missouri, posted on X.\n\"The Texas GOP knows it can’t win unless they cheat,\" the Texas Aggie Democrats posted on X. \"Until Republicans are ready to enact a national partisan gerrymandering ban, we’re calling on Democratic leaders across the country to fight fire with fire.\"\n\"This is unlawful, blatant racist systemic voter suppression in real time,\" Rep.

      "text": "The Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives passed a redrawn congressional map on Wednesday that creates up to five new winnable Grand Old Party (GOP) seats in Congress, and further deepens a national redistricting battle between states, news agency AP reported.\nThe approval came after President Donald Trump directed Texas and other states to submit rare mid-decade redistricting plans, as Republicans anticipate a difficult midterm election in 2026.\nWith the move, which is basically the delimitation of congressional districts, the Republicans want to make it easier for them to hold on to their slim US House majority in the 2026 midterm elections so that Democrats have little ability to thwart President Donald Trump’s agenda.\nThe maps, which would give Republicans five more winnable seats, need to be approved by the GOP-controlled state Senate and signed by Republican Governor Greg Abbott before they become official.\nBut the Texas House vote had presented the best chance for Democrats to derail the redraw.\nGovernor Abbott was quoted by the news agency AP as saying that he signed the law. Abbot had put escalating pressure on Democrats to come home during their two-week walkout, which delayed the vote.\n“While Democrats shirked their duty, in futility, and ran away to other states, Republicans stayed the course, stayed at work and stayed true to Texas,” he said.\nDemocratic legislators delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing Texas earlier this month in protest. The protesting lawmakers were kept under round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday's session.\nThe approval of the Texas maps on an 88-52 party-line vote is likely to prompt California's Democratic-controlled state Legislature this week to approve of a new House map creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. But the California map would require voter approval in November.\nDemocrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.\nTexas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party's interest. State Representative Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, was quoted as saying by news agency AP that the US Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said on the floor. After nearly eight hours of debate, Hunter took the floor again to sum up the entire dispute as nothing more than a partisan fight. “What's the difference, to the whole world listening? Republicans like it, and Democrats do not.”\nDemocrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship. “In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” State Representative Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, DC, choose their voters.”\nThe Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state's map to create five new Democratic seats.\n“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we're going to fight fire with fire.”\nFormer US President Barack Obama supported Newsom’s proposed congressional redistricting plan, calling it a “responsible approach” as Democrats responded to Republican-led efforts in Texas promoted by President Donald Trump.\n“I believe that Governor Newsom’s approach is a responsible approach. He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximize it,” Obama said during a fundraiser on Martha’s Vineyard event on Tuesday, as per reports by Associated Press.\nWhile Obama acknowledged that “political gerrymandering” is not his “preference,” he warned that failing to counter Republican moves could have serious consequences.\n“If Democrats don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy,” the former US President said.\n(With AP inputs)"

Former RNC chair gives Dems ominous warning after Texas rams through new maps\nFormer Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele delivered a firm warning to Democrats after Republicans in Texas passed a new redistricting map that heavily favors Republicans.\nDuring the Wednesday broadcast of his MSNBC show \"The Weeknight,\" Steele said the only way Democrats could undo what their Republican counterparts just did was to \"find themselves 37 more seats in the state of Texas.\" The former career Republican said Democrats should be \"severely focused on state legislatures, because that's where you get your a-- whipped.\"\n\"That's the new reality. And and this is just this is the tip of a very, very long spear politically that will play out across the country,\" he said. \"And I think folks need to understand that the Republicans don't plan to fight fair. They're not planning to stand up candidates who will make a give you a message about the future of the country, or the future of the state, or the future of the district. They're just going to grab the power.\"\nREAD MORE: 'Baby out with the bathwater': Red state Trump voters speaking out against this key policy\n\"The Weeknight\" co-host Alicia Melendez asked Steele if he thought the new congressional map in Texas — which was passed through the Texas House of Representatives on party lines — were made possible because Republicans had nothing to fear. Steele replied affirmatively, acknowledging \"there was no incentive\" for his former party to do the right thing.\n\"Politics is about incentives and disincentives. And all the incentives worked with the Republicans here,\" he said. \"And that's why I started the conversation with, you got to whittle at that legislature. You got to make them pay politically.\"\n\"This is from Donald Trump on down,\" he continued. \"When you're not held accountable for the crap you're doing, when you get to throw out the Emoluments Clause or lock a member of the legislature in the House and tell her she can't she can't go to the bathroom without your permission and nothing happens, what do you think comes next?

      "text": "In a vote on Wednesday, Texas House Republicans approved new congressional maps before the next Census to help them keep control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections. The political move fulfills President Trump’s wish to possibly gain five more GOP seats in the U.S. House.\nHouse lawmakers voted 88-52 in favor of the new maps. The Senate could vote on the measure as early as Thursday.\nDuring the debate, Republicans argued they believe these maps comply with legal requirements, and some even said the new maps would “undo” gerrymandering.\n“We are not the first state to do mid-decade redistricting, and we didn’t invent the playbook. But who led the way? Blue states, the ones that you all fled to,” Republican Rep. Katrina Pierson said. “They say we’re diluting the minority districts. They call us racist. But the facts don’t match your rhetoric. Texas currently has zero Black CVAP districts, and under the new map, there are two. Now I haven’t been in the third grade in a really long time. But when you go from zero to two, that’s an increase.”\nDownload the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Facts™.\nPoint phone camera here\nDemocrats call maps discriminatory, cite voting rights concerns\nDemocrats strongly opposed the maps, calling them discriminatory and arguing that they violate the Voting Rights Act, which protects against racial discrimination in voting.\n“The question I want to ask as we prepare for a final vote on this bill is that, ‘Is it worth it?’” Democratic State Rep. Venton Jones asked the chamber. “Is it once again worth it to ignore the will of countless Texans saying ‘No, we don’t want this. Let’s focus on flood relief, let’s increase access to healthcare, let’s provide funding for our public schools.’ There are still bodies being recovered from the flooding, but we are here focusing on maps. Not flood relief, not returning the bodies to loved ones, but racist maps, not Texans.”\nDemocratic protest ends as California pushes back\nDemocrats returned to the Lone Star State earlier this week, after a standoff with Republicans, in a coordinated effort to prevent Republicans from having enough members present to pass the new congressional map. Their departure halted the redistricting process. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said his state is set to approve new maps favoring Democrats, a move praised by former President Barack Obama."

This mid-decade do-over was pushed by President Donald Trump, who hoped to mitigate the risk of a midterm blue wave that might stymie the final years of his second term in office. Trump leaned on the Republican-controlled state to create new GOP House districts, leading to a weeks-long standoff between state-level Democrats and Republicans.\nWhen it became clear that they could not stop the maps through other means, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum to a special legislative session called by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor and Attorney General Ken Paxton pushed for the arrest of the absent lawmakers and weighed ways to strip the legislators of their seats. The Democrats only returned when Gov. Gavin Newsom put forward a plan to neutralize Texas’s action via redrawn maps in California.\nFollowing their return, Democrats were placed under police surveillance and only allowed to leave the state’s Capitol with written permission. Democrats protested the requirements by tearing up their slips and spending the night on the floor of the House.\nThe newly approved maps will head to the state Senate, where they are expected to pass quickly. In response to the news of maps passing the House, Newsom shared a post to X that read, “It’s on.”\nIn a statement, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Kendall Scudder criticized Republicans for taking up Trump’s project before passing relief packages for victims of the state’s recent floods. He called the map “disgraceful” and a “violation of the Voting Rights Act.”\n“This fight is far from over. We, and the American people, will see this map in court,” he wrote."

      "text": "Texas’ Republican-led House of Representatives voted along party lines to pass a controversial new electoral map Wednesday, a redistricting move designed to give the GOP an additional five seats in the U.S. House. Democrats and voting rights advocates have denounced the effort, saying it will disenfranchise minorities and other voters.\nThe Texas Senate is expected to take up the bill in committee tomorrow, and the bill could head to Gov. Greg Abbott's desk as soon as Friday.\nRedistricting typically happens at the start of every decade after a new census, but Texas Republicans pushed ahead with redrawing the map much earlier at the urging of President Donald Trump, as the GOP hopes to mitigate the risk of losses in next year’s midterm elections.\nTexas Democrats took drastic action against the gerrymandering plan earlier this month, abandoning a legislative special session in the state House and fleeing to blue states, such as Illinois, to block the vote. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott promptly issued civil arrest warrants against the lawmakers, attempting to compel their return.\nThe lawmakers’ action sparked a wider conversation on gerrymandering, and Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom called for a Nov. 4 special election aimed at redrawing his state’s congressional map to offset GOP gains in Texas.\nMost of the Texas Democrats returned this week, restoring quorum and allowing the vote to proceed in a second session. They have vowed to continue the fight in the courts.\n“Texas will have to go to the courts,” Democratic state Rep. Gene Wu said while addressing his colleagues Wednesday afternoon. “But California, New York, Illinois, Michigan and many other states — look at what’s happening here. Look carefully. This is the future, right here, if you do not act now.\n“What Texas looks like — this process, this division, this partisanship and, most importantly, leaders who simply do not give a damn what you need or want anymore. If you do not stand up today and push back, the American dream will be dead and our democracy will fall.”"

      "text": "Texas House finally passes contentious redistricting map stalled by AWOL Democrats\nThe Texas House on Wednesday passed a highly contentious, mid-decade redistricting bill – just days after dozens of Democratic lawmakers returned to Austin, ending a two-week-long effort to block the legislation backed by President Trump.\nIn a 88-52 party-line vote, Republican state lawmakers approved the newly drawn congressional map, which could net the GOP up to five additional seats in Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm election.\nIn the partisan showdown over House Bill 4, Democrats fumed over the timing of the redistricting push and also claimed the legislation undermined minority representation, violated voting rights protections and lacked public input.\nState Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins (D), one of several Democrats who fled to Chicago prevent the House from establishing a quorum, accused Republicans of drawing up the new map “in the cloak of darkness” and not giving the Texas Legislative Black Caucus – which she said, “potentially will lose two seats” – a “role in this process.”\nState Rep. Todd Hunter (R), the author of the bill, shot back: “You absolutely did … but you left 17 to 18 days.”\n“Now you’re getting on the microphone saying, why didn’t I involve you? Well, I wasn’t going across state lines to find you. I was here,” Hunter continued.\n“Don’t come into this body and say we didn’t include you – You left us for 18 days, and that’s wrong,” he later added.\nIn defense of the legality of the effort, Hunter argued that “redistricting can be done at any point in time.”\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” he added, noting that he believes Supreme Court precedent is on his side.\nCountering claims that minority Texas residents are being harmed by redistricting, Hunter noted that “four of the five new seats are hispanic majority … that’s a pretty strong message, and it’s good.”\nOf the more than 50 state Democratic lawmakers that fled the state capital earlier this month in opposition to House Bill 4, 20 were listed as absent for Wednesday’s session, however several appeared to show up before the final vote.\nThe Rotunda at the Texas Capitol filled up with protesters opposed to redistricting on the morning of the final vote. The gallery also had to be warned on several occasion to not applaud Democrats debating against the measure.\nThe Republican-controlled House shot down all 12 Democrat-proposed amendments ahead of the vote, including a bid to block the implementation of the new map until the federal government releases files related to notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\nDemocrats, in an attempt to stretch out the debate, also sought to add amendments delaying the new map from taking effect until 2028 and linking implementation to the establishment of an independent redistricting commission and a federal court ruling that the map does not suppress minority voters.\nThe majority of the missing Dems returned Monday – amid threats of arrest, removal from office and after paychecks began being withheld – and were only allowed to leave the chamber after they agreed to be released into the custody of a Department of Public Safety officer, who would ensure they return for the redistricting vote.\nTexas state Rep. Nicole Collier (D) refused to sign the permission slip imposed by Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows and slept in the chamber for the two nights leading up to the vote.\nThe runaway lawmakers decided to make their return after an initial special session was adjourned Friday and after California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced plans to redraw district lines in the Golden State in a bid to cancel out the Texas GOP’s new map..\nThe Texas House Democratic Caucus said in a statement that they would “launch the next phase in their fight against the racist gerrymander that provoked a weeks-long standoff with Governor [Greg] Abbott and President Trump.”\n“Don’t delete your emails, don’t delete your text messages,” state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer (D) – one of several Democrats promising a legal challenge to the new map – warned Republican lawmakers just before the vote."

      "text": "By Jackson Richman and Joseph Lord\nContributing Writers\nThe Texas House on Wednesday advanced a newly drawn congressional map that would give Republicans five extra seats in the U.S. House.\nA procedural motion related to the bill advanced in an 88-52 vote, which followed several hours of debate. It set the stage for a second House vote later Wednesday evening to give the bill final approval.\nIf it passes, it will head to the state Senate before it can make it to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk.\nThe Texas Senate passed an earlier version of the map on Aug. 13.\nTexas House Democrats returned to the state after a two-week standoff as they denied a quorum during the first special session, which was called to pass the redrawn map and to respond to flooding in central Texas.\nThey returned after two conditions were met: the end of the first special session, and California’s introduction of a redrawn congressional map that would respond to Texas’ redistricting by seeking to add five Democratic seats in California.\n“Under the advice of legal counsel, Democrats must return to Texas to build a strong public legislative record for the upcoming legal battle against a map that violates both the current Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,” the Texas House Democratic Caucus said in an Aug. 14 statement.\n“(President Donald) Trump thought he could easily get his way in Texas with compliant Republicans, but Democrats fought back ferociously and took the fight to Trump across America. We will return to the House floor and to the courthouse with a clear message: the fight to protect voting rights has only just begun.”\nAbbott announced a second special session on Aug. 15.\n“Delinquent House Democrats ran away from their responsibility to pass crucial legislation to benefit the lives of Texans,” he said in a statement.\n“We will not back down from this fight. That’s why I am calling them back today to finish the job. I will continue to use all necessary tools to ensure Texas delivers results for Texans.”\nTexas House Speaker Dustin Burrows on Monday announced that the chamber had a quorum after Democrats returned to the state.\n“Now is the time for action,” he said. “We will move quickly.”\nThe map redraw would eliminate a Democratic district in the Austin area and cause a possible race between Democratic Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Casar.\n“Our best opportunity of holding (Congressional District) 35 is for [Casar] to stay in it and fight Trump, though I know that is a difficult challenge for him,” Doggett, who represents the 37th Congressional District, told The Texas Tribune, adding that Casar’s “coming over into a district that he represents very little of now“ will lead to “intra-party division.”\nIn response to Texas’ redistricting, California has announced it will also redraw its congressional map.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an Aug. 14 statement that “California will not sit idle.”\n“This moment calls for urgency and action,” he said, adding that “that is what we are putting before voters this November, a chance to fight back.”\nSee related story on Newsom’s plan here."

      "text": "Texas House passes Trump-backed map that could give Republicans five more seats in midterms\nVote comes after Democratic lawmakers temporarily fled state to stall passage of new map, which Trump wants to use to lock in Republican control in midterms next year\nThe Texas House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a new Trump-backed congressional map plan that would net the Republican party as many as five additional seats in next year’s midterms, potentially solidifying GOP control of the U.S. Congress.\nThe 88-to-52 vote occurred along party lines. It came after Democratic lawmakers in Texas temporarily fled to deny the statehouse quorum to move forward with the redistricting effort.\nThe state Senate passed a similar map on Sunday, and the new map is expected to head to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk later this week.\nIn July, President Trump said he was pushing the Texas GOP to redraw state congressional maps to pick up more Republican seats, with the president later claiming the GOP was “entitled” to more seats in the state after his successful 2024 campaign there.\n“Texas will be the biggest one,” Trump said at the time. “And that’ll be five.”\nIn a late-night Truth Social post on Wednesday, President Trump lauded the efforts in Texas, saying, “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself. Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing.\n“More seats equals less Crime, a great Economy, and a STRONG SECOND AMENDMENT. It means Happiness and Peace. But Republicans, there is one thing even better - STOP MAIL-IN VOTING, a total fraud that has no bounds. Also, go to PAPER BALLOTS before it is too late - At one tenth the cost, faster, and more reliable. If we do these TWO things, we will pick up 100 more seats, and the CROOKED game of politics is over. God Bless America!!!”\nThe redistricting battle in the Lone Star State produced a number of unusual scenes, with more than 50 Democrats temporarily fleeing the state, then facing arrest warrants upon their return.\nAs Democrats began to trickle back into the state in recent days, Rep. Nicole Collier of Fort Worth remained on the House floor for days rather than sign a permission slip allowing members to leave only if they agreed to be shadowed by state law enforcement.\nProtesters chanted outside the House chambers during Wednesday’s vote, where doors were locked to further prevent representatives from leaving the floor until the map plan got a vote.\nDuring the debate, Texas Republicans openly described the maps as a way to increase GOP fortunes, but denied accusations that the plan was racist and aimed at disenfranchising minority voters.\n\"The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,\" State Representative Todd Hunter, who authored the bill creating the new map, said on Wednesday.\nRedrawing congressional district lines typically only takes place at the beginning of the decade, after the U.S. Census.\nRepublicans in Texas believe that five districts currently held by Democrats can be redrawn to make the districts more favorable to conservative candidates.\nDemocrats argue that the new proposed maps are racist and unlawfully divide Black and Latino communities to dilute minority representation. The GOP on Wednesday said the claim was unfair, noting that President Trump won a majority of Texas Latinos in the 2024 election.\nAcross the country, Democrats have threatened to respond to Texas’s efforts with reciprocal redistricting in California and other blue states.\nFormer President Barack Obama said he supports California Democrats' efforts to redraw congressional districts aiming to offset the move passed by Texas Republicans.\n“I wanted just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas, and take it to the voters and see what happens,” Obama said on Tuesday in a rare political intervention and his first public comments expressing support for the push by California Governor Gavin Newsom.\n“But I want to be very clear: Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House that is effectively saying, ‘Gerrymander for partisan purposes so we can maintain the House despite our unpopular policies, redistrict right in the middle of a decade between censuses’ — which is not how the system was designed — I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this.”\nNewsom is backing a plan in California to redraw congressional maps via ballot measure in November; his party plans to shift five Republican-held districts to put more Democratic voters in them.\n“We’re not going to act as if anything is normal any longer. Yes, we’ll fight fire with fire. Yes, we will push back. It’s not about whether we play hardball anymore,” Newsom said at a virtual news conference with other Democratic leaders on Wednesday. “It’s about how we play hardball. And California has your back.”\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives, Republicans hold a single-digit majority and are facing an unfavorable midterm dynamic next year.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "The Texas House passed its proposed congressional redistricting map Wednesday evening on a final vote of 88-52, after holding a preliminary vote, adjourning, and starting a new legislative day.\nThe map was then passed Thursday morning by a committee in the Republican-dominated Senate. The full Senate could vote on it as early as Thursday night.\nWednesday’s House vote followed a fierce debate that stretched over more than eight hours, coming just two days after the chamber reestablished a quorum with the return of Democratic representatives.\nState Rep. Todd Hunter (R-Corpus Christi) authored the House bill, but he claimed not to know who drew the map – only that it came from the same law firm, Butler Snow, that advised him as to the map's legality. He repeatedly pointed to a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Rucho v. Common Cause, which held that partisan gerrymandering in redistricting is beyond the reach of federal courts.\n\"Redistricting can be at any point in time, and I want everybody to know this,\" Hunter said. \"You want transparency? Here’s the U.S. Supreme Court legal transparency. The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance.\"\nHunter's transparency didn't go over well as several Democrats lined up to question him on exactly why the districts were drawn in a manner they say dilutes the votes of minorities.\nOutside of the chamber, in the Capitol building rotunda, a protest was taking place. Activists, congressmen and everyday Texans filled the rotunda, at times chanting, giving speeches and constantly holding up a large black and white sign reading, \"END GERRYMANDERING SAVE DEMOCRACY.\"\nBack in the House chamber, Hunter made an argument for the need for a new congressional map. He said that some of the current congressional districts had been drawn as minority coalition-opportunity districts – that is, districts drawn to elect representatives of a coalition of different non-white racial or ethnic groups.\nHe cited a recent ruling of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, Petteway v. Galveston County, to argue that minority coalition districts are not allowed under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That case remains under dispute.\nHunter argued that four out of the five new congressional districts are majority Hispanic. State Rep. Armando Walle (D-Houston) countered that, in splitting up Houston's Congressional District 29, that district – originally drawn as an Hispanic-opportunity district – would no longer have an Hispanic majority.\n\"The political performance in 29 stays Democrat,\" Hunter said.\nHunter identified five specific congressional districts now held by Democrats as targeted for Republican pickup: Congressional Districts 9 (U.S. Rep. Al Green, Houston), 28 (U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, Laredo), 32 (U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, Farmers Branch), 34 (U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, McAllen), and 35 (U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, Austin).\nHunter said he had chosen to update the map following the Democratic quorum break, on his own initiative and in consultation with legal counsel, in order to increase Republican performance.\nState Rep. Gina Hinojosa (D-Austin) was one of several Democratic lawmakers who sought to point out that there had not been a single opportunity for the public to weigh in on the map lawmakers were preparing to vote on.\nHunter responded to each such argument by saying the majority Republicans were under no obligation to hold such hearings, although they had held three lengthy public hearings to take testimony during the first special session.\n\"You're not going to like this, but for 18 days, things could have happened. You all chose to walk out. To me, you damaged the process. You kept people away. You kept work from being done,\" Hunter told House Democrats. \"Don't use that as an excuse to belabor this bill.\"\nDemocrats argue the map is racial gerrymandering, not just partisan\nDemocrats largely focused their opposition to the map on charges that it is racially discriminatory and that it allows lawmakers to pick their voters rather than the other way around.\nState Rep. Chris Turner (D-Grand Prairie) attempted unsuccessfully to attach an amendment that would have struck the bill's enacting clause, killing it. He argued that Hunter's claim the bill's goal was purely partisan gain was disingenuous.\n\"This bill intentionally discriminates against Black and Hispanic Texans and other Texans of color by cracking and packing minority communities across the state of Texas,\" Turner said. \"We are in a turning point for our democracy if we allow cheating – and that’s what this is, it’s cheating – elections will no longer reflect the will of the people in a democracy.\"\nState Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer (D-San Antonio) unsuccessfully sought to attach an amendment requiring the bill to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which forbids racial discrimination in redistricting.\n\"This seems to be just a debate about red shirts versus blue shirts, and that is not how this process works,\" Martinez Fischer said.\nMartinez Fischer also unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill so that – if, as expected, the proposed map faces a court challenge – that Texas' 2021 congressional redistricting map would apply until that court challenge is resolved.\nSimilarly, state Rep. Harold Dutton (D-Houston) unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill to require an explicit federal court ruling that the redistricting map does not discriminate against Black and Latino voters. Hunter argued against the amendment on the grounds that the Supreme Court had struck down the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act.\nState Rep. Donna Howard (D-Austin) unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill by barring the map from taking effect until after the state had established an independent redistricting commission.\n\"Members, what is happening on the floor today is a blatantly obvious attempt to determine the outcome of the upcoming midterm election before a single vote is cast,\" Howard said. \"HB 4 is a blatant attempt by a handful of elected officials to choose their voters because they are afraid their voters won't choose them.\"\nHouse Minority Leader Gene Wu (D-Houston) unsuccessfully attempted to box Republicans in by proposing an amendment that would attach a trigger to the redistricting plan, allowing it to go forward only with the complete release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSpeaker of the House Dustin Burrows ruled Wu's amendment not germane to the bill, following a motion by Rep. Briscoe Cain (R-Deer Park).\n\"[President Donald] Trump is in those files, and that’s why he’s fighting to keep them hidden,\" Wu said in a statement issued ahead of the House debate. \"This amendment forces Republicans to choose between their loyalty to Trump and their obligation to expose sexual predators.\"\nUltimately, Democrats proposed 12 amendments, with all of them either being tabled, withdrawn, or ruled not germane to the bill.\nThe Democratic walkout and its role in the map's construction\nHouse Democrats had managed to stall passage of the map for more than two weeks by scattering out of state. They drew national attention to the issue, prompting several Democratic-led states – most notably California – to pursue their own redistricting efforts to neutralize the effect of Texas' move as far as the balance of power in Congress goes.\nHowever, in the Texas House itself, the immediate effect was to push at least one redesigned seat further into the Republican column.\nOn Monday, following the meeting of the full House, the chamber's select committee on congressional redistricting rapidly approved a new map designed to flip five congressional seats from Democratic to Republican control in the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe House map differed from the version it had considered in the first special session – and from the version still being weighed by the Texas Senate – primarily in that it would redraw the Houston-centered Congressional District 9 to include largely rural and conservative Liberty County. That would likely complete the task of shifting TX-9 from a solidly Democratic district to a solidly Republican one.\n\"At the end of the day one chamber will have to approve the other's map or they will need to iron it out in conference committee,\" said Michael O. Adams, a political science professor at Texas Southern University."

      "text": "Texas legislators on Wednesday passed a new state congressional map drawn at the behest of President Donald Trump to flip five Democratic-held US House seats in next year’s midterm elections, after dozens of Democratic lawmakers ended a two-week walkout that had temporarily blocked passage.\nRepublican legislators, who have dominated Texas politics for over two decades, have undertaken a rare mid-decade redistricting to help Trump improve their party’s odds of preserving its narrow US House of Representatives majority amid political headwinds. The map, which will have to be reconciled with the state Senate’s version, has triggered a national redistricting war, with governors of both parties threatening to initiate similar efforts in other states. Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom is advancing an effort to redraw his state’s map to flip five Republican seats. Democratic-controlled California is the nation’s most populous state while Republican-led Texas is the second most populous. The Texas map would shift conservative voters into districts currently held by Democrats and combine some districts that Democrats hold.\nOther Republican states — including Ohio, Florida, Indiana and Missouri — are moving forward with or considering their own redistricting efforts, as are Democratic states such as Maryland and Illinois.\nRedistricting typically occurs every 10 years after the US Census to account for population changes, and mid-decade redistricting has historically been unusual. Whenever the maps are drawn, in many states, lawmakers manipulate the lines to favor their party over the opposition, a practice known as gerrymandering.\nTexas Democrats on Wednesday raised multiple objections to and questions about the measure.\nRepresentative John Bucy, a Democrat, said from the House floor before passage of the bill that the new maps were clearly intended to dilute the voting power of Black, Latino and Asian voters, and that his Republican colleagues bending to the will of Trump was deeply worrying.\n“This is not democracy, this is authoritarianism in real time,” Bucy said. “This is Donald Trump’s map. It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\nRepublicans argued the map was created to improve political performance and would increase majority Hispanic districts.\nBucy was among the Democrats who fled the state earlier this month to deny the Texas House a quorum. In response, Republicans undertook extraordinary measures to try to force the Democrats home, including filing lawsuits to remove them from office and issuing arrest warrants. The walkout ended when Democrats voluntarily returned on Monday, saying they had accomplished their goals of blocking a vote during a first special legislative session and persuading Democrats in other states to take retaliatory steps. Republican House leadership assigned state law enforcement officers to monitor Democrats to ensure they would not leave the state again. One Democratic representative, Nicole Collier, slept in the Capitol building on Monday night rather than accept a police escort.\nRepublicans, including Trump, have openly acknowledged that the new map is aimed at increasing their political power. The party currently controls 25 of the state’s 38 districts under a Republican-drawn map that was passed four years ago.\nDemocrats and civil rights groups have said the new map dilutes the voting power of racial minorities in violation of federal law and have vowed to sue.\nNationally, Republicans captured the 435-seat US House in 2024 by only three seats. The party of the president historically loses House seats in the first midterm election, and Trump’s approval ratings have sagged since he took office in January.\nTexas Republicans approve Trump-backed congressional map to protect party’s majority\nhttps://arab.news/jrzj4\nTexas Republicans approve Trump-backed congressional map to protect party’s majority\n- The map, which will have to be reconciled with the state Senate’s version, has triggered a national redistricting war, with governors of both parties threatening to initiate similar efforts in other states"

The Senate is expected to pass the measure and send it to Governor Abbot for his signature.\nORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS:\nThe Texas House, by a party-line vote of 88-52, passed the initial reading of a measure to realign the state’s congressional seats. The measure is designed to add five additional Republican seats to the Texas delegation.\n“Today, the Texas House passed one big, beautiful map — and I was proud to cast my vote to advance President Trump’s America First agenda,” State Representative Jared Patterson (R-Frisco) wrote in a post on social media. “Radical progressives like Gavin Newsom, Beto O’Rourke, and their allies tried to tell Texans what’s best for us. Today, we showed them that WE will always defend our citizens and protect their voices.”\nThe initial passage of the measure followed a five-hour debate, during which leaders of both parties expressed their support and opposition to the bill.

State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said on the floor. After nearly eight hours of debate, Hunter took the floor again to sum up the entire dispute as nothing more than a partisan fight. “What’s the difference, to the whole world listening? Republicans like it, and Democrats do not.”\nDemocrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship.\n“In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” State Rep. Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, D.C., choose their voters.”\nState Rep. John H. Bucy blamed the president. “This is Donald Trump’s map,” Bucy said. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\nRedistricting becomes tool nationwide in battle for US House\nThe Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state’s map to create five new Democratic seats.\n“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.”\nA new California map would need to be approved by voters in a special election in November because that state normally operates with a nonpartisan commission drawing the map to avoid the very sort of political brawl that is playing out. Newsom himself backed the 2008 ballot measure to create that process, as did former President Barack Obama. But in a sign of Democrats’ stiffening resolve, Obama Tuesday night backed Newsom’s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP’s Texas move.\n“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party’s main redistricting arm.\nThe incumbent president’s party usually loses seats in the midterm election, and the GOP currently controls the House of Representatives by a mere three votes. Trump is going beyond Texas in his push to remake the map. He’s pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to create new Republican seats. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland’s and New York’s maps as well.\nHowever, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California’s or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can’t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.\nTexas Democrats decry the new maps\nIn Texas, there was little that outnumbered Democrats could do other than fume and threaten a lawsuit to block the map. Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.\nDemocrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas’ legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up.\nRepublicans contend the new map creates more new majority-minority seats than the previous one. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state’s House seats that will be represented by a Black representative.\nState Rep. Ron Reynolds noted the country just marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act’s passage and warned GOP members about how they’d be remembered if they voted for what he called “this racial gerrymander.”\n“Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in the body this day,” Reynolds, a Democrat, said.\nRepublicans hit back at criticism\nRepublicans spent far less time talking on Wednesday, content to let their numbers do the talking in the lopsided vote. As the day dragged on, a handful hit back against Democratic complaints.\n“You call my voters racist, you call my party racist and yet we’re expected to follow the rules,” said State Rep. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson. “There are Black and Hispanic and Asian Republicans in this chamber who were elected just like you.”\nHouse Republicans’ frustration at the Democrats’ flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable. The GOP used a parliamentary maneuver to take a second and final vote on the map so it wouldn’t have to reconvene for one more vote after Senate approval.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip. The doors were only unlocked after final passage more than eight hours later. One Democrat who refused the 24-hour police monitoring, State Rep. Nicole Collier, had been confined to the House floor since Monday night.\nSome Democratic state lawmakers joined Collier Tuesday night for what Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez dubbed “a sleepover for democracy.”\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust several Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent."

Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.\nDemocrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas’ legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up.\nRepublicans contend the new map creates more new majority-minority seats than the previous one. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state’s House seats that will be represented by a Black representative.\nState Rep. Ron Reynolds noted the country just marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act’s passage and warned GOP members about how they’d be remembered if they voted for what he called “this racial gerrymander.”\n“Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in the body this day,” Reynolds, a Democrat, said.\nRepublicans hit back at criticism\nRepublicans spent far less time talking on Wednesday, content to let their numbers do the talking in the lopsided vote. As the day dragged on, a handful hit back against Democratic complaints.\n“You call my voters racist, you call my party racist and yet we’re expected to follow the rules,” said State Rep. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson. “There are Black and Hispanic and Asian Republicans in this chamber who were elected just like you.”\nHouse Republicans’ frustration at the Democrats’ flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable. The GOP used a parliamentary maneuver to take a second and final vote on the map so it wouldn’t have to reconvene for one more vote after Senate approval.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip. The doors were only unlocked after final passage more than eight hours later. One Democrat who refused the 24-hour police monitoring, State Rep. Nicole Collier, had been confined to the House floor since Monday night.\nSome Democratic state lawmakers joined Collier Tuesday night for what Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez dubbed “a sleepover for democracy.”\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust several Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.\n___\nRiccardi reported from Denver.

      "text": "The Republican-controlled state House in Texas has passed new congressional maps that aim to pad the party’s majority in Washington by as much as five seats in the midterm elections, a move that comes as battles over redistricting spread across the country.\nWith Texas set to fully enact its new plan as soon as this week, urged on by President Donald Trump, California Democrats are moving quickly to implement a plan carving up their state's maps in retaliation. Meanwhile, top Republicans in states like Indiana, Missouri and Florida continue to talk about tweaking their maps to create more Republican-controlled congressional seats in the 2026 elections. Ohio’sredraw, which it must do under state law, could benefit the GOP, too.\nGovernors in Democratic-controlled states are weighing a response too, but in many cases, they’re restrained by procedural hurdles or by other practical limitations — some have already stretched their own gerrymandered maps as far as they could go — that could make a tit-for-tat more difficult.\nWatch NBC 4 free wherever you are\nIt’s all expected to come to a head in a matter of weeks, against the backdrop of a race for the congressional majority in Washington that sits on a knife’s edge.\nThe final outcome in Texas\nLawmakers in the GOP-controlled Texas House passed their map Wednesday, days after Democrats returned from a two-week \"quorum break\" in which they fled the state to hold up the bill. But they could only delay, not derail, the new Republican maps, which convert three deep-blue districts into deep-red ones and tilt two Democratic-held South Texas districts slightly further toward the GOP, too.\nState Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who represents Corpus Christi and co-sponsored the new map, kicked off the day with some straight talk.\n“The underlying goal is this plan is straightforward: Improve Republican political performance,” he told his colleagues, adding that the crux of the changes to the maps center on five districts that “now trend Republican in political performance.”\n“While there’s no guarantee of an electorate success, Republicans will now have an opportunity to potentially win those districts,” he added.\nAfter a handful of lawmakers remained in the chamber overnight to protest House leadership for requiring Democrats agree to police escorts to ensure they don't attempt to skip town again, Democrats took to the floor to criticize their Republican colleagues over the maps. They questioned whether their Republican colleagues were truly not factoring in the racial compositions of districts, as they claimed, warning Democrats will have \"their day in federal court.\" They also hit out at their scheduling in the special legislative session, which put redistricting on the calendar ahead of voting on relief for the victims of the July floods in the Hill Country.\n“This is Donald Trump’s map. It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows the voters are rejecting his agenda and instead of respecting that rejection, he’s changing the rules,\" said state Rep. John Bucy III of Austin, a Democrat. \"Instead of listening to the people he’s trying to silence them, and Texas Republicans have been more than willing to help.”\nCalifornia Democrats move to retaliate\nCalifornia's legislature saw an hours-long hearing Tuesday as Democrats there speed toward passing legislation that will call for a fall special election putting redistricting on the ballot. Voters will decide whether to override the state's independent redistricting commission and approve temporary, Democratic-drawn maps for the rest of the decade.\nThose maps are the political inverse of the ones in Texas — endangering a handful of incumbent Republicans and putting Democrats in position to net up to five seats from California’s new map, according to estimates from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.\nThe hearing turned contentious amid interruptions and partisan clashes between lawmakers. Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats of wasting state resources — a statewide special election would cost significant funds — and for bucking the agreement that empowered the state’s independent redistricting panel in the first place.\n“California should lead the way — when other states decide to do something else, we shouldn’t react to them, we should prove by example that we can do this better. That we create the foundations for the rest of the nation,” said state Assemblyman David Tangipa, a Republican from the Fresno area, said.\nSteve Bennett, a Democratic state legislator from Ventura, lashed out at Texas Republicans’ mid-decade redistricting by comparing it to power grabs by “autocrats” like Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"We prefer the agreement we all had to play by the old rules,\" he said. \"But when autocrats change the rules and the norms that we are using to decide who has power, we can either fight back or we can potentially permanently lose the ability ever to fight back again.\"\nDemocrats need to get the maps passed through the legislature soon in order to bring the question to the voters this fall, if they want to enact the maps in time for the 2026 midterms.\nRepublicans are seeking to delay that, with a group of lawmakers suing this week, arguing that Democrats haven’t given the public the required time to review legislation before voting.\nOther states weigh jumping into the fray\nWhile the spotlight remains on California and Texas, redistricting remains a live ball in other states.\nOhio must redraw its lines by law, since the state legislature approved its 2021 map without Democratic support. The timing could work out well for Republicans, who control the legislature there and could stand to gain depending on how the maps are drawn.\nTwo of Ohio's three Democratic House members won re-election last cycle by less than 3 percentage points.\nIn Indiana, the state’s Republican members of Congress have in recent days announced their support for a redraw there, where the party already controls seven of the nine congressional seats.\nIndiana Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, hasn’t said whether he plans to call for a special session of the legislature. But Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana earlier this month to meet with the governor as the redistricting debate swirled.\nIn Missouri, Republicans have been cajoling Gov. Mike Kehoe to call a special legislative session for redistricting there, where the GOP controls six of the eight congressional seats.\nIn Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said this week that people can “anticipate” a mid-decade redraw because there has been a “sea change in demography” since the 2020 census.\nOutside of California, where their efforts are subject to approval from voters, Democrats face a smattering of other challenges if they want to redraw maps in other states.\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been vocally supportive of the Texas House Democrats' attempts to delay the redistricting process in their home state, hasn't ruled out a redistricting push in his backyard. But Democrats already hold 14 of the state's 17 congressional districts there.\nNew York Democrats are also interested in redrawing the lines there, but they face logistical hurdles to change the state constitution, which would likely mean no changes until 2028 at the earliest.\nNatasha Korecki, Bridget Bowman and Ryan Chandler contributed."

Greg Abbott before they can be enacted ahead of next year’s midterm elections. But that will only mark the first chapter in a redistricting battle that has spread across the country.\nDemocratic lawmakers in California are advancing a plan this week that seeks to offset Texas’s effort with a map of their own that would add as many as five seats to their party’s ranks in the House. They will need voters to approve the new lines in a special election this fall to circumvent California’s independent redistricting commission.\nThe spotlight has been on Texas and California, given the swings in power that could result from their newly drawn lines. But a handful of other GOP-led states are considering their own redistricting pushes that could have major implications in the 2026 battle for the House, where Republicans currently hold a slim three-seat majority.\nOhio: The Buckeye State is required to redraw its congressional lines by law because state lawmakers approved a 2021 map without Democratic support. The timing could work out well for Republicans, who control the Legislature. Two of Ohio’s five Democratic House members won re-election last cycle by less than 3 points.\nIndiana: The state’s entire Republican congressional delegation has in recent days lined up behind a redistricting effort that’s been encouraged by the White House. The GOP already controls seven of the nine congressional seats in the Hoosier State.\nGov. Mike Braun, a Republican, hasn’t said whether he plans to call for a special session of the Legislature to take up a new map. But Vice President JD Vance traveled to Indiana earlier this month to meet with Braun.\nMissouri: Republicans have been pushing Gov. Mike Kehoe to call a special legislative session for redistricting in the Show Me State, where Republicans control six of eight House seats.\nFlorida: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said this week that people can “anticipate” a mid-decade redraw because there has been a “sea change in demography” since the 2020 census. The GOP represents 20 of the Sunshine State’s 28 congressional districts.\nIsrael moves forward with plan to take over Gaza City\nBy Andrea Mitchell\nAlmost two years into the war in Gaza, Israel is calling up thousands of army reservists to gain control of the last major civilian area: Gaza City.\nTroops are already beginning to clear people from their tents on the outskirts of the city, home to as many as a million residents, and force them south. Sixty-thousand reservists will be involved in the offensive, and the service of 20,000 troops already deployed will be extended. This comes despite a rare public clash between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his hand-picked army chief of staff, who had said that the military is exhausted and that the offensive would endanger surviving hostages.\nThat point was emphasized to NBC News by Orna Neutra, whose son Omer is believed to have been killed during the Oct. 7 massacre. She told me if Israeli forces gets close to where Hamas is holding the remaining hostages, the militants won’t hesitate to execute them. She and her husband have been pressing for a peace deal to get their son’s remains returned.\nHer view reflects broad opposition by the Israeli public to expanding the war. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of Israelis marched in a nationwide strike against Netanyahu’s plans, the largest protest in Israel in years.\nAs the world focuses on Gaza, Israel’s government announced final approval of thousands of new homes for Jewish settlers in the West Bank, where settlers have been escalating their attacks against Palestinian residents. Rapidly becoming a tinderbox, the new settlements had been on hold for years because of opposition from the Arab world, European leaders and previous U.S. administrations. An estimated 700,000 Israeli settlers now live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The location of the new settlement is controversial because it would separate two major Palestinian cities, Ramallah and Bethlehem.\nAll this is taking place as some of America’s closest allies, including France, the United Kingdom and Canada, have said they may join the more than 145 countries that recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire. Israel has become increasingly isolated because of a monthslong blockade of food, water and fuel, followed by a trickle of aid delivered at only four sites in southern Gaza guarded by the IDF. The United Nations has said resulting clashes have led to 1,400 Palestinian deaths of people seeking food and 4,000 injuries.\nPresident Donald Trump, who recently told Netanyahu to “finish the job” in Gaza, spoke admiringly of the prime minister Tuesday night in an interview with conservative radio host Mark Levin, calling him a “war hero” for his strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Trump added, “I guess I am, too. Nobody cares, but I am, too. I mean I sent those planes,” referring to the U.S. strikes in Iran.\n🗞️ Today's other top stories\n- 🇺🇦 Ukraine talks: U.S. and NATO military officials met to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine as the White House worked to arrange a summit between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin.

Each vote passed 88-52.\nBefore the final vote, lawmakers debated a series of amendments offered by Democrats, all of which were rejected by the Republican majority. The bill was the sole item on the agenda for the day's floor session, which began at 10 a.m.\n\"Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!!\" President Trump said in a Truth Social post late Wednesday night. \"Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself. Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing.\"\nSenate to consider House-passed bill\nThe Texas Senate, which approved a similar version of the redistricting legislation earlier this week, is scheduled to take up the House-passed bill when it convenes this Thursday at 7 p.m.\nIf the Senate approves the House version without changes, the legislation could be sent to Gov. Greg Abbott by the end of the week. If not, the two chambers will need to reconcile differences in a conference committee.\nBill passed after Democrats broke quorum\nThe vote came after a dramatic standoff earlier this month, when Democratic lawmakers fled the state to break quorum and block action on the redistricting bill. Their absence stalled the Legislature and effectively ended the first special session, delaying the measure for two weeks.\nDemocrats return under tight restrictions\nGov. Greg Abbott called a second special session hours after the first adjourned, and Democrats returned to the House chamber on Monday, allowing the legislation to move forward.\nThat evening, HB 4 passed out of the House redistricting committee on a 12-8 party-line vote.\nTo prevent another walkout, House Speaker Dustin Burrows imposed a rule requiring Democratic members to be escorted by Department of Public Safety officers if they wished to leave the Capitol.\nWhile most Democrats complied, Rep. Nicole Collier of Fort Worth refused. She was temporarily locked in the House chamber and was later allowed to go to her Capitol office. On Monday, Collier filed a petition in state court alleging she was under \"illegal restraint by the government.\"\nThe court has not yet ruled on the matter.\nDemocrats protest escort rule overnight\nOn Tuesday, several other Democrats joined Collier in protest, tearing up their signed escort agreements and spending the night in the Capitol. With the passage of HB 4, Republican leaders dropped the escort requirement.\nThe redistricting plan is expected to give Republicans a significant advantage in the 2026 midterm elections, potentially flipping up to five congressional seats.\nAbbott vows to sign redistricting bill\nIn a statement, the governor praised House Republicans for passing a congressional redistricting bill he says better reflects the will of Texas voters. He criticized Democrats for leaving the state to block the measure, calling their efforts futile.\nAbbott said he will sign the bill once it passes the Senate.\n\"Republicans stayed the course, stayed at work and stayed true to Texas,\" Abbott said.\nLawmakers react sharply to House passage\nLawmakers from both parties offered passionate and sharply divided responses after the Texas House passed new redistricting maps. Democrats condemned the maps as racially discriminatory and vowed legal action, while Republicans defended them as fair and reflective of recent voting trends.\n\"They have racist implications, yes,\" said Rep. Nicole Collier (D-Fort Worth), who spent two nights sleeping in the House chamber to avoid being taken into custody by DPS before the vote. \"You need to be able to trust the voters to elect the candidate they want and keep them together in their same communities. That didn't happen today. Today, they just split that up. So, it's very disappointing to see this is the trajectory they're going.\"\nRep. Katrina Pierson (R-Rockwall) pushed back on the criticism.\n\"It's victimization all day, every day,\" Pierson said. \"There's no account for values, and that's what's most important. People of Texas have spoken in the last several cycles. Minority voters are turning Republican, and that is how this map is drawn. It's perfectly legal. Of course, they are going to take us to court, but we will win.\"\nRep. Venton Jones (D-Dallas) expressed deep frustration.\n\"My most sincere reaction is disappointment,\" Jones said. \"Once again, Republicans continue to make power grabs on the back of Black and Brown communities. We fought for one of the most important issues we have as Texans, and that's our right to vote. We're going to still continue to fight. We're going to take this to the courts.\"\nRep. Mitch Little (R-Lewisville) celebrated the outcome.\n\"Thrilled,\" Little said. \"For the first time, Republicans have united. They've been courageous in bringing this to the floor. It was necessary. Democrats are only concerned about those things when they're not in charge. In California, in Illinois, in Massachusetts, they absolutely redistrict and gerrymander to their benefit.\"\nCBS News Texas will continue to provide updates as the redistricting debate unfolds."

Texas Democrats later posted a video of the call online.\n“You really are inspiring so many people, and I just want you to know that you are among those who history will reveal to have been heroes of this moment,” Harris said. “So, you just stay strong and do what you are doing.”\nRepublican Rep. Brian Harrison criticized Democratic theatrics around the passage of the new map on Wednesday morning.\n“These crocodile tears and bad, bad kabuki theater coming from the Democrats right now is just pathetic,” said Harrison in an interview on Fox News. “Quite frankly, my fourth grader’s production of ‘Shrek’ last year had better acting.”\n“These Democrats are pretending they don’t like redrawing maps for partisan political purposes, but the reality is Democrat state after Democrat state has been doing this for decades,” he added. “The dirty little secret is they’re only objecting now because it’s Republican states that are finally doing it.”"

A quorum was not present after most Democratic state representatives lef\nThe latest:\nDemocrats delayed the inevitable, but the clock ran out. The new map passed the House 88-52 on Wednesday.\nNow that the congressional map has passed the lower chamber, the new map will be taken up by the Senate Thursday.\nA new congressional map that could give Republicans five new seats in Congress cleared a big hurdle Wednesday.\nAfter being stalled in the House by Democrats who broke quorum by leaving the state in protest.\nBefore the vote, Democrats criticized Republicans for not holding any hearings on the map in the second Special Session.\nThere are no major overhauls of the version from special session one, but a few subtle changes to some district boundaries.\n‘Cowardice and cheats’\nWhat they're saying:\n\"So let's talk about cowardice and cheats, because if you knew you could win this next election, you wouldn't be taking this effort to try to steal five seats from elected officials that members of color elected to represent them in Washington, D.C.,\" said Rep. Ann Johnson (D-Houston).\n\"You want transparency? Here's the U.S. Supreme Court's legal transparency. The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: Improve Republican political performance,\" said Rep. Todd Hunter (R-Corpus Christie).\n\"Would you believe it would be a great process to include the public in a way that they could see what's going on, or do we want to do the things in the cloak of darkness here?\" asked Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins (D-San Antonio).\n\"Well, you've been gone in the cloak of darkness for 18 days,\" Hunter responded.\n\"I could have public input while you were gone,\" Hunter continued. \"You prevented this. You were gone from acting.\"\n\"You removed key economic engines from CD 30, like Love Field in Downtown Dallas. Hell, you even took her home out of her district. She told you that, but you ignored her on that, too. Just like you ignored the thousands of Texans who voiced their strong opposition to this corrupt process,\" said Re. Chris Turner (D-Grand Prairie).\nIs mid-decade redistricting allowed?\nDig deeper:\nWhile it's not common, mid-census redistricting is not illegal.\nCongressional districts are typically redrawn at the beginning of each decade to compensate for new census data, but the U.S. Constitution allows for the measure to be taken at other times as well.\nRedistricting effects in North Texas\nNorth Texas redistricting\nLocal perspective:\nIn North Texas, the new map would turn Rep. Julie Johnson's District 32 seat from a Dallas County-based district to possibly stretching past Tyler in East Texas.\nThe District 33 seat held by Rep. Marc Veasey moves out of Tarrant County exclusively into Dallas County.\nAnd Jasmine Crockett will no longer live in the district she represents.\nWhat's next:\nThe senate has a committee hearing Thursday morning.\nWhen the Texas Senate takes up the map on Thursday, there will be Democrat opposition, but not enough to sink the bill.\nA floor vote will be Thursday night, and if it passes, then it will be sent to Gov.

The proposed changes could create new competitive congressional districts within Texas.\nThe vote follows a period of heightened debate over the legislative process.

The map’s architects argue that it aims to create fairer, more balanced representation.\nOpponents of the new map have raised concerns about the timing and potential impact of the changes. Critics argue that the mid-decade redistricting is an attempt to create a political advantage for the party in power. They contend that such changes should be made only after a new census to ensure they are based on the most up-to-date population data.\nThe Texas vote is part of a broader national trend.

      "text": "Princeton University professor Eddie Glaude Jr. claimed during a rant on MSNBC Wednesday that Texas Republicans were engaged in a “racist agenda” pushed by President Donald Trump.\nThe Texas House of Representatives will vote on a new congressional map after Democrats returned to the state after fleeing to states like New York and Illinois, attempting to thwart a special session of the body to consider redistricting that could net Republicans up to five seats in the United States House of Representatives. Glaude told MSNBC host Chris Jansing the redistricting was similar to Trump’s efforts to contest the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. (RELATED: Greg Abbott Fact-Checks Jasmine Crockett’s ‘Racist’ Redistricting Claims)\n“It’s an echo of the past, but it’s also a kind of reflection of the crisis that we find ourselves in. We cannot disentangle what’s happening in Texas from Trump’s demand that Texas find him five new seats. That’s similar to the call to the secretary of state in Georgia, right?” Glaude claimed. “So it’s part of this process of undermining democratic norms that we feel in this moment. But we also need to see it as well as part of a broader strategy, I think, of really disenfranchising black and brown voters, of dismantling, I think, the infrastructure of the civil rights movement and its legal infrastructure, I would say.”\nWATCH:\n“And so — because think about it, Chris, 4.3 million black people live in Texas, the largest number of black folk in any state, in any country, and in the union. And look at that districting map,” Glaude continued. “How are their voices going to be represented? So I want us to understand what we’re seeing not only in Texas, but around the country as a part of racial gerrymandering, as part of the racialist and racist agenda of the Trump Administration. I know we want to talk about it simply in terms of politics, but there’s something insidious underneath it all.”\nTrump carried 46% of the Hispanic vote, 40% of the Asian vote and 13% of the black vote in 2024, according to CNN’s exit poll. In 2020, Trump carried 32% of Hispanic voters, 34% of Asian voters and 12% of black voters, according to CNN’s exit poll.\nBy comparison, in CNN’s 2016 exit poll, Trump only received 28% of the Hispanic vote, 27% of the Asian vote and 8% of the black vote. In Texas, Trump made substantial gains in southern Texas, carrying districts represented by moderate Hispanic Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vincente Gonzales.\n“I want to give people, Eddie, a visual example of how maps like the ones in Texas dilute the strength of some voters, boost the strength of others,” Jansing said. “Just an example, 2024. President Trump beat Harris in Texas by 56-42 percent. 71 percent of voters in that district that backed Trump, under these new maps, it would be an even greater advantage, 79 percent. Is that what a representative democracy should look like?”\n“No, absolutely not. And part of what we’re witnessing over and over again, right, is the dismantling of the basic foundations of our democratic process,” Glaude claimed. “And so I think we have to ring the alarm. We can’t get caught up in the spectacle of it all. We have to understand the deliberate, the targeted, with precision, ways in which these folk are acting. And what we’re seeing in Texas, from, you know, the kidnapping of state representatives to having to sign permission slips, to having highway patrol, you know, accompany, you know, legislators, all of this doesn’t bode well for the state of our democracy.” (RELATED: ‘Have They Been Rigged?’: Scott Jennings Lists Blue States Where Dems Dominate Congressional Maps)\nFormer Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York claimed the “stress” of dealing with racism caused black people to develop a myriad of diseases, including cancer and diabetes during a June CNN appearance discussing the Texas redistricting effort.\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder and former Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas both claimed that Trump would use the Texas redistricting to secure a third presidential term in office. Under the 22nd Amendment, Trump is ineligible to run for a third term due to his victorious 2016 and 2024 campaigns for the White House.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Republicans in the Texas House were poised Wednesday to approve an aggressively partisan redistricting, overcoming Democratic protests and delivering to President Donald Trump the congressional map he called for, designed for Republicans to pick up five U.S. House seats.\nThe redrawing of Texas' maps was only the first battle in what is likely to be a bruising and protracted coast-to-coast clash over redistricting between states led by Republican and those led Democrats over the coming months. The California Legislature is expected to vote Thursday on a newly drawn congressional map designed to flip as many as five Republican-held seats to the Democrats, an exact counterweight to Wednesday's vote in Texas.\nIf the fight broadens significantly, the outcome of the redistricting war could help determine control in the U.S. House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority, even before a single vote is cast in what were expected to be very close midterms elections in 2026.\nAlready, Trump and his allies have been looking beyond Texas to other Republican states, including Indiana, Missouri and Florida. Beyond California, Democratic state leaders are looking at Illinois and Maryland before the 2026 midterms, and New York before the 2028 presidential election, vowing to embark on their own mid-decade redistricting efforts.\nFor Democrats, however, the fight is proving harder. The California effort will require working around the state rules that give an independent commission responsibility for redistricting. A temporary map up for passage in the state Legislature on Thursday would have to be approved by voters in a special election in November.\nThe path to passage in Texas has been far simpler, despite sustained Democratic opposition.\nWednesday's vote on the map had been delayed more than two weeks by dozens of Democratic state representatives, who left the state to halt its passage by denying the House enough members to meet.\nBut as soon as they returned Monday, Republican lawmakers moved swiftly to ensure its passage, passing an updated version out of two committees in rapid succession, and ensuring Democrats could not leave again by assigning each of them a state police chaperone.\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers convened at 10 a.m. local time to discuss the map, consider amendments and finally take a series of votes, with final passage expected late in the day.\n\"The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,\" state Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, said Wednesday in his introduction of the map legislation, known as House Bill 4.\n\"According to the U.S. Supreme Court, we can use political performance\" in drawing congressional districts, he said. \"And that is what we've done.\"\nAs debate began, chants and cheers could be heard through the closed doors from dozens protesting in the Capitol rotunda against the redistricting.\n\"House Bill 4 is an illegal and racially discriminatory congressional map that this body has no business passing,\" said state Rep. Chris Turner, a Dallas-area Democrat. \"This illegal and rigged mid-decade redistricting scheme is dividing our state and our country.\"\nThe map under consideration was revised by Republicans since it was originally introduced last month. It would still aim to flip the five seats Trump has publicly called for, but it had been reworked slightly in several areas to place additional Republican voters in the districts where Republicans already hold House seats.\n\"Please pass this map ASAP,\" Trump urged on social media Monday. \"Thank you, Texas!\"\nEx // Top Stories\nThe theater is easy to miss, but the laughs aren’t\nBusiness, industry groups have lined up against legislation requiring tests for bias, notices of use\nA monthslong pressure campaign directed at the mayor’s office seems to have his attention. But it remains unclear how much The City can do for tenants\nIf approved in the state House, the map would go to the state Senate, where Republican leaders have an even stronger hand. A vote there was scheduled for Thursday.\nGov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who has been forceful in his support for the map, was expected to sign it soon after passage.\nThe actions by Texas and California this week will likely narrow the battlefield for control of the U.S. House next year, a critical fight that will shape the remainder of Trump's term. Even so, with the House so narrowly divided, the expanding fight over redistricting is not likely to determine control of the chamber.\nSome of the districts being redrawn in the two states could remain competitive in a nonpresidential election, and even without the states most likely to redistrict -- Texas, California and Ohio -- 27 House seats remain that were decided in 2024 by fewer than 5 percentage points in states unlikely to redraw their maps. Of those 27, 14 are held by Republicans, 13 by Democrats. Narrow as the battlefield may be, it is still likely to be big enough to determine control.\nStill, Texas is the biggest prize available for Republicans, Trump has said.\nAnd tensions have been rising at the state Capitol this week.\nWhen the House chamber officially opened for Wednesday's proceedings, arriving lawmakers were greeted by the unusual presence of several of their Democratic lawmakers already inside after spending the night there in protest.\nThe lawmakers objected to being forced to sign a permission slip and have a state police officer assigned to follow them, as a condition set by the Republican speaker for allowing them to leave the Capitol, after they returned from their walkout.\nThe protest grew from the actions of state Rep. Nicole Collier of Fort Worth, who refused to sign a permission slip. She slept in the brown leather chair at her legislative desk Monday, along with two others who joined her. On Tuesday, the group had grown to about a half dozen, as several members tore up the slips they had signed and went into the chamber.\nThe protest drew national attention, as had Democrats' two-week walkout this month. But neither action could undo the political reality that Republicans in the Texas House far outnumber Democrats, 88-62, and passage of the map there could be passed on a party-line vote.\nThe strict attendance rules imposed by the House would expire after the passage of the map, House Speaker Dustin Burrows said Wednesday. No member was permitted to leave the House chamber without a permission slip, he said.\nThe vote Wednesday was taking place during a 30-day special legislative session, the second such session called by Abbott to address redistricting and also measures related to the deadly July 4 floods in the Texas Hill Country. (The first session expired without any action because of the Democratic walkout.)\nNo votes have taken place on the House floor related to flood recovery. That was set to be handled later, after redistricting.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\nRepublicans argued the map was created to improve political performance and would increase majority Hispanic districts.\nMr Bucy was among the Democrats who fled the state to deny the Texas House a quorum.\nIn ending their walkout and voluntarily returning on Aug 18, Democrats said they had accomplished their goals of blocking a vote during a first special legislative session and persuading Democrats in other states to take retaliatory steps.\nNationally, Republicans captured control of the 435-seat US House in 2024 by only three seats.\nThe party of the president historically loses House seats in the first midterm election, and Mr Trump’s approval ratings have sagged since he took office in January.

      "text": "(The Texas Tribune) The Republican-led Texas House on Wednesday approved a new congressional map crafted to hand five additional U.S. House seats to the GOP over fierce opposition from Democrats, who cast the plan as a racially discriminatory attempt by President Donald Trump to stack the deck in next year’s midterm election.\nThe House adopted the map, 88 to 52, along party lines. A Senate panel advanced a similar map Sunday, and the full chamber was expected to send the new lines to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk later this week.\nRepublican lawmakers are pursuing the unusual mid-decade redistricting plan, which has set off a national map-drawing war, amid pressure from Trump to protect the GOP’s slim majority in Congress. The effort comes just four years after the Legislature last overhauled the state’s congressional map following the 2020 Census.\nDemocrats in the Texas House staged a two-week walkout over the plan in a bid to stall the map’s passage and rally a national response among blue states, where lawmakers could launch their own retaliatory redistricting efforts. The roughly two dozen Texas Democrats who returned to Austin on Monday said they were starting the next phase of their fight: putting the screws on their Republican colleagues and establishing a record that could be used in a legal challenge to the map.\nRepublicans have said the new districts were drawn purely to maximize their partisan advantage, arguing that the GOP’s margins of victory in 2024 supported new lines that entrenched their hold on power. They have also framed the effort as a response to Democratic gerrymandering elsewhere.\nRep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi and the map’s sponsor, emphasized in laying out House Bill 4 that Republicans were legally permitted to pursue redistricting in the middle of the decade and to maximize partisan gain.\n“Redistricting can be done at any point in time,” he said. “The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance.”\nTo create up to five Republican pickup opportunities, the map dismantles Democratic strongholds around Austin, Dallas and Houston and makes Democrat-held seats in South Texas redder — all without seriously jeopardizing any of the 25 districts Republicans already control. The proposed map also would push a handful of Democratic members of Congress into seats already represented by other Democrats, setting up possible primary battles between long-serving members of the Texas delegation and younger newcomers.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that states can draw electoral maps on partisan grounds. But under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the map cannot diminish the voting power of people of color.\nDemocrats condemned the plan, arguing it widens Republicans’ partisan edge by unconstitutionally packing people of color — who are driving almost all of Texas’ population growth — into some districts while spreading them throughout others to reduce their ability to elect their preferred candidates.\n“This bill represents one of the most blatant assaults on fair representation we have seen in Texas,” Rep. Ana Hernandez, D-Houston, said. “Diversity is our greatest strength. It is what makes our neighborhoods vibrant, our workforce dynamic and our communities resilient. HB 4 silences that diversity instead of celebrating it.”\nAmong the first points Democrats sought to make Wednesday was that the congressional map was the first piece of legislation the House was voting on, rather than flood-related bills responding to the devastating Hill Country floods. Several Democrats wore dark green in honor of the flood victims.\n“Why was House Bill 1, the flood relief bill that is the House's answer to the deadly July 4 flooding that killed over 135 people, not the first order of business of this special session for the Texas House?” Rep. Gina Hinajosa, D-Austin, asked on the floor.\nRepublicans shot down all 12 amendments Democrats proposed to the bill, including measures to block the map’s implementation until the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and until a federal court found that the plan would not suppress the vote of people of color.\nRepublicans shot down 12 Democrat-proposed amendments Wednesday, including measures to block the map’s implementation until the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, until the establishment of an independent redistricting commission and until a federal court found that the plan would not suppress the vote of people of color.\nThe GOP-led House also rejected amendments to use the state’s current congressional map if the new lines are held up in court, and to only implement the new map within two years of the decennial census.\nIn proposing each amendment, Democrats sought to stretch out the debate and press their Republican colleagues on how race was considered in drawing the lines, in an effort to establish a record that they could bring to court in challenging the map on constitutional grounds.\nDemocrats tried to highlight the plan’s possible impact on people of color — who they argued will see their vote diluted under the new lines — and the fact that Republicans were redrawing the map in the middle of the decade, using five-year-old census data.\nThe map is “a clear violation of the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,” said Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, after raising an amendment to sink the map. “This body has no business passing this bill. We need to kill it and get on with the real business of the people of this state.”\nAn amendment from Democratic Rep. Gene Wu of Houston that sought to tie the implementation of the new congressional map to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files was found to be not germane to the redistricting bill after another representative contested it, effectively killing the attempt to put Republicans in a political bind.\nWu said Wednesday morning he planned to introduce the amendment to force Republicans \"to choose between their loyalty to Trump and their obligation to expose sexual predators.\" But members ultimately did not debate the amendment or vote on it following the procedural challenge from Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, that was sustained by the House parliamentarian.\n“The bill changes the composition of districts for the election of members to the United States House of Representatives,\" Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said, reading the parliamentarian's ruling. \"The Wu amendment makes the effective date of the bill contingent on a matter that is not even remotely related to the congressional redistricting.”\nRepublicans have successfully quashed all 11 amendments Democrats have so far tried to tack onto the bill.\nThe House voted down an amendment offered by Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, to add a section to the bill saying that the map complies with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination against voters on the basis of race.\nThe vote to reject the amendment was 87 to 51, along party lines.\nRep. Todd Hunter, the map’s Republican sponsor, opposed the amendment, saying that the bill already complies with the Voting Rights Act.\n“It’s unnecessary, and guess what? It’s incorporated in this bill,” he said.\nThe debate over the amendment grew heated at times, as Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, D-San Antonio, pressed Hunter on the lack of public input allowed on the map and its impact on Black and Latino voters.\n“You own the walkout,” Hunter said to applause from Republicans, referring to Democrats’ two-week departure from the state to block action on the map. “But don’t come into this body and say we didn’t involve you. You left for 18 days, and that’s wrong.”\nMartinez Fischer argued that if the map’s proponents were certain it complied with the Voting Rights Act, they should have no problem voting in favor of the amendment.\n“It just says that we are going to follow Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,” he said. “That’s it. There are no tricks. There are no hidden words. That’s all it does. It shouldn’t be controversial.”\nAs the Texas House began its anticipated and delayed debate on congressional redistricting, dozens of protesters gathered in the Capitol rotunda and their chants at times seeped into the chamber, albeit faintly.\nThe demonstrators rallied support for Rep. Nicole Collier, a Fort Worth Democrat who has been on the floor of the Texas House since Monday afternoon after she refused to sign a permission slip allowing members to leave the chamber only if they agreed to be shadowed by state law enforcement officers.\nCollier is among the Democrats who participated in a two-week walkout to delay passage of a new congressional map that aims to give the GOP five additional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n\"Let her out,\" the protesters chanted, some holding a giant banner that read \"Put Texans First.\"\nRep. Gene Wu of Houston, chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, intends to try blocking the new congressional map from going into effect until President Donald Trump releases the files of disgraced billionaire and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe lower chamber is expected to vote later Wednesday on the proposed map pushed by Trump, which redraws districts with the aim of getting the GOP five more seats in the U.S. House. In a statement, Wu said he plans to introduce an amendment that would make the maps conditional on Trump releasing all \"investigations, prosecutions, or custodial matters\" related to Epstein. The goal, Wu said, is to force Republicans \"to choose between their loyalty to Trump and their obligation to expose sexual predators.”\nThe files related to Epstein, who died in federal prison while awaiting trial, have long been the source of conspiracy theories. The Trump administration was expected to release them, but reversed course this summer. Trump's name was reportedly mentioned in them, though it is not clear exactly in what context.\n“Trump is in those files, and that's why he's fighting to keep them hidden,” Wu said.\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune.

      "text": "UPDATE - Governor Greg Abbott has released a statement on the passage, congradulating his fellow republicans and condemning Democrats in the wake of the quorum break in the special session.\nI congratulate Speaker Burrows and the Republican members of the Texas House of Representatives for passing congressional districts that better reflect the actual votes of Texans,\" said Abbott. \"While Democrats shirked their duty, in futility, and ran away to other states, Republicans stayed the course, stayed at work and stayed true to Texas. I will sign this bill once it passes the Senate and gets to my desk.\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives on Wednesday kicked off a heated debate over a new congressional map creating five new potential GOP seats that is expected to pass the chamber later in the day as part of a growing national redistricting battle.\nThe plan is the result of prodding by President Donald Trump, eager to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives. Texas Democratic lawmakers delayed a vote for 15 days by leaving the state in protest, depriving the House of enough members to do business.\nState Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes. “The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said as debate began.\nDemocrats responded that that was counter to the country’s values. “In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” said State Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington DC choose their voters.”\nThe Texas State Senate, also controlled by Republicans, needs to also pass the map and GOP Gov. Greg Abbott must sign them before they become official. The House debate was expected to be the lengthiest and greatest obstacle to the Republican push, but both parties expected the legislation to ultimately pass given the GOP’s significant majority in the chamber.\nDemocrats said they’re preparing to challenge the new map in court.\nSome House Democrats returned from their flight on Monday, only to be assigned round-the-clock police escorts to ensure their attendance at Wednesday’s session. Seven who refused were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream Tuesday night, led by Rep. Nicole Collier, who represents a minority-majority district in Fort Worth. Her staff removed a pillow, blanket and bag of personal effects early Wednesday.\nAs lawmakers trickled into the chamber, several Democrats gave Collier a hug, said “Thank you,” and took photos with her. In a social media post Tuesday night, Collier put a call from 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris on her cellphone’s speaker. Harris told Collier that, “We are all in that room with you.”\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip before exiting.\nFurious national Democrats have vowed payback for the Texas map, with California’s Legislature poised to approve new maps adding more Democratic-friendly seats later this week. The map would still need to be approved by that state’s voters in November.\nNormally, states redraw maps once a decade with new census figures. But Trump is lobbying other conservative-controlled states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to squeeze new GOP-friendly seats out of their maps as his party prepares for a difficult midterm election next year.\nDemocrats are energized by the fight in Texas\nAs House session was about to begin, about two dozen demonstrators supporting Democrats sang “Fighting for Democracy, we shall not be moved” outside the chamber. GOP House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that the public gallery will be cleared if there are disruptions. The public gallery was mostly empty as the session was gaveled in.\nBut the 100 members required to do business were present. About 200 people have gathered in the Capitol’s rotunda for a rally supporting Democrats, holding signs saying “End Gerrymandering — Save Democracy,” “Defend the Constitution” and “Fascism is here.”\nTexas Democrats spent the day before the vote continuing to draw attention to the extraordinary lengths the Republicans who run the Legislature were going to ensure it takes place.\nCollier started it when she refused to sign what Democrats called the “permission slip” required by Burrows to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them. Collier spent Monday night and Tuesday on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.\nDallas-area Rep. Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.\n“It’s a weird feeling,” she said. “The only way to explain the entire process is: It’s like I’m in a movie.”\nDallas-area Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez joined the protest inside the House chamber and called it a “slumber party for democracy,” and she said Democrats were holding strategy sessions on the floor.\n“We are not criminals,” Houston Rep. Penny Morales Shaw said before joining Collier, too.\nCollier said having officers shadow her was an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her movements.\nRepublican leader says Collier ‘is well within her rights’\nBurrows brushed off Collier’s protest, saying he was focused on important issues, such as providing property tax relief and responding to last month’s deadly floods. His statement Tuesday morning did not mention redistricting, and his office did not immediately respond to other Democrats joining Collier.\n“Rep. Collier’s choice to stay and not sign the permission slip is well within her rights under the House Rules,” Burrows said.\nUnder those rules, until Wednesday’s vote, the chamber’s doors were locked, and no member could leave “without the written permission of the speaker.”\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust Wu and several other Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.\nDemocrats outside the Capitol reported different levels of monitoring and some said the officers watching them were friendly. But Austin Rep. Sheryl Cole said in a social media post that when she went on her morning walk Tuesday, the officer following her lost her on the trail, got angry and threatened to arrest her.\nGarcia said the officer who tailed her home also came in the grocery store when she went shopping with her 9-year-old son.\n“I would imagine that this is the way it feels when you’re potentially shoplifting and someone is assessing whether you’re going to steal,” she said."

      "text": "After 7 hours of debate Aug. 20, the Texas House signed off on a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts. The party-line vote came two days after approximately two dozen House Democrats ended a two-week walkout in protest of the redistricting effort.\nIn a statement following the House vote, Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated lawmakers for approving a congressional map that he said would \"better reflect the actual votes of Texans.\" Abbott said he would sign the redistricting bill \"once it passes the Senate and gets to my desk.\"\nTexas House Democratic Caucus leader Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston, told reporters that Democrats and their lawyers were \"looking forward to taking this to the courts as fast as possible.\" Democrats have said the map is unconstitutional and \"racially discriminatory,\" while Republicans have asserted that the map \"complies with the law\" and was designed to help more Republicans get elected to the U.S. House.\nWhat you need to know\nRep. Todd Hunter, a Corpus Christi Republican who filed the proposed map, said 37 of Texas’ 38 congressional districts would be redrawn, with “the primary changes focused [on] five districts for partisan purposes.”\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: to improve Republican political performance,” Hunter told House members Aug. 20. “Each of these newly-drawn districts now trend Republican. While there's no guarantee of electoral success, Republicans will now have an opportunity to potentially win these... five new districts we have.”\nRepublicans have a narrow majority in the U.S. House, and President Donald Trump requested that Texas and other GOP-led states redraw their congressional maps to help maintain that majority during the 2026 midterm elections. On Aug. 14, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said his Democratic-led state would hold a Nov. 4 special election on a new congressional map drafted in response to Texas’ redistricting plan. No other states had passed a redistricting plan as of press time.\nAll states are constitutionally required to redistrict every 10 years, after a census, although mid-decade redistricting is not unprecedented. In 2003, Texas lawmakers also redrew the state's congressional map, leading Democrats to travel to Oklahoma in protest.\nHouse Democrats decried Texas’ proposed map as “illegal and racially discriminatory,” arguing that it would “dilute” minorities’ voting power by dividing historically Black and Hispanic communities into multiple congressional districts.\n“Texans and Americans all across the country are watching,” Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, said on the House floor Aug. 20. “They know this map before us is a calculated maneuver to diminish the voices of the very communities that power Texas. ... Communities of color make up 95% of our growth in the last decade.”Hunter and Sen. Phil King, a Weatherford Republican carrying the map in the Texas Senate, have asserted that race was not considered when the proposed lines were drawn. State lawmakers did not draft the map themselves—Hunter said it was provided by the Butler Snow law firm, which has branches in Austin, Dallas and other states; King said Aug. 7 that the map was created by the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which was also involved in drawing Texas’ current congressional lines.\nHouse lawmakers passed the congressional map with an 88-52 vote along party lines, sending it to the Senate. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Aug. 19 that the Senate will take up the House’s version of the map. The Senate redistricting committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. Aug. 21 to consider legislation referred to the committee.\nHow we got here\nDemocrats traveled to Illinois, New York and Massachusetts on Aug. 3 to stall a vote on the proposed congressional map. In their absence, the House did not have enough members present to pass any bills, and the first special legislative session of the year was cut short as a result.\nThe House redistricting committee swiftly sent the map to the House floor after Democrats returned to Austin on Aug. 18. Democrats said they returned to “build the legal record necessary to defeat this racist map in court.”\nDemocrats who left the state and returned Aug. 18 were each assigned state troopers to accompany them “around the clock” anytime they left the Capitol building. The order requiring the police escorts was set to expire after House lawmakers approved the congressional map.\nRep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, slept in the House chamber for two nights after refusing to sign the agreement allowing her to leave the Capitol under the supervision of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Several other House Democrats, including Wu; Reps. Penny Morales Shaw, D-Houston; Rhetta Andrews Bowers, D-Rowlett; Mihaela Plesa, D-Dallas; Salman Bhojani, D-Euless; and Cassandra Garcia Hernandez, D-Farmers Branch, shredded their agreements and joined Collier on the House floor Aug. 19.\nDuring the Aug. 20 House session, Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, directed the House sergeant-at-arms to lock the chamber doors. Lawmakers from either party who wanted to leave the chamber while the House was in session were required to get permission from the sergeant-at-arms. That order and the requirement for DPS escorts ended when the House adjourned around 6:20 p.m. Aug. 20.\nAfter the House vote, Collier told reporters she was tired and \"wanted to cry.\"\n\"It was hard to sit through hypocrisy, the lies, the way that they tried to silence our voices,\" Collier said. \"The fact that I am angry and furious means that I still want to fight. ... This is the start of a new beginning [and] the new Democratic Party.\"Zooming in\nDuring debate on the proposed map Aug. 20, Hunter and Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, D-Dallas, raised their voices as they discussed how the map would impact Black Texans.\n“I'm talking about the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, who potentially will lose two seats,” Gervin-Hawkins said, asking Hunter if “these maps do eliminate two African American-leaning districts?”\nHunter said he did not think the redistricting plan would “eliminate them, because I think anybody can win any election.” He acknowledged that “the demographics” of some districts would change under the proposal.\n“So there is your racism, right?” Gervin-Hawkins asked. Hunter said he disagreed.Hunter pushed back against Gervin-Hawkins’ concerns that Black Democrats were not involved in the redistricting process, noting that dozens of Democrats left the state to fight the legislation.\n“For 17-18 days, you left,” Hunter said. “Now you're getting behind the microphone [asking] why didn't I involve you? Well, I wasn't going across state lines to find you—I was here. You left us for 18 days, and that’s wrong.”\nHunter previously said that the “primary changes” in the proposed map were focused on five districts:\n- TX-09, served by U.S. Rep. Al Green, D-Houston\n- TX-28, served by U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo\n- TX-32, served by U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Farmers Branch\n- TX-34, served by U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen\n- TX-35, served by U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Austin\nMore details\nDuring the Aug. 20 House session, dozens of Texans met in the Capitol rotunda to protest the redistricting effort. Green urged protesters to register to vote and spread awareness about the proposed map.\n“Regardless of how today ends, the fight is not over,” Green said. “One vote matters.”Casar, who also spoke at the rally, told House lawmakers Aug. 1 that he was concerned the map was drawn with out-of-state interests in mind.\n“It's clear to me that these maps aren't drawn by anybody from Texas,” Casar said Aug. 1. “The southern suburbs of Austin and Hays County that I currently proudly represent, they have been drawn out to Port Aransas. There's northern parts of Austin drawn to northeast Texas; western parts of Austin drawn out to Midland-Odessa.”\nDuring a hearing in the first special session, Rep. Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, said she thought the map would help Black voters receive more “appropriate representation.”\n“I just wanted to make it clear that... there are minority Republicans,” Rep. Katrina Pierson, R-Rockwall, said during the Aug. 1 hearing. “I mean, there [are] Black and Hispanic Republicans on the dais, so I just don't think it's fair to just assume that the Anglo districts are going to lead to more Anglo representation.”\nHouse Democrats proposed 7 amendments that, if approved, would have stopped or delayed the proposed map from taking effect by requiring studies on the proposed congressional districts and requiring a court ruling about the map’s impacts on minority voters. Rep. Yvonne Davis, D-Dallas, also proposed adopting a different map that she said was created by her legislative staff.\nAll amendments proposed by Democrats were voted down on party lines.\nOne more thing\nBefore House lawmakers began discussing the proposed map Aug. 20, some Democrats questioned why the chamber was taking up redistricting before passing bills aimed at helping communities recover from the deadly July 4-5 floods.\n“Why was House Bill 1, the flood relief bill that is the House's answer to the deadly July 4 flooding that killed over 135 people, not the first order of business of this special session for the Texas House?” Rep. Gina Hinojosa, D-Austin, asked.\nRep. Ellen Troxclair, R-Lakeway, countered that “had the members of this House shown up and done their jobs in this first special session, we would have already passed critical flood relief legislation and provided financial relief and support for all of the impacted communities.”\nThe House is scheduled to convene at 10 a.m. Aug. 21 to consider six flood-related bills, including proposals to increase safety and evacuation requirements for youth summer camps; streamline first responder communications; and provide up to $324 million in flood relief grants."

      "text": "Texas Republicans advance map targeting Democratic House seats\nState’s House approves plan as leaders in Democratic states ponder response\nThe Republican-led Texas Legislature moved forward Wednesday on a congressional redistricting plan intended to target Democrat-held seats, a mid-decade partisan gerrymandering push ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe Texas House of Representatives voted 88-52 to advance the plan, sending it to the Texas state Senate, where it is expected to pass as soon as Thursday evening.\nPresident Donald Trump spurred the changes to buoy his party’s prospects of maintaining control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections. California is among Democrat-controlled states where leaders have considered whether to retaliate with their own redistricting push.\nControl of the U.S. House hinges on fewer than a half-dozen seats. The Lone Star State’s House delegation currently comprises 25 Republicans and 12 Democrats, with one vacancy after the March death of Democrat Sylvester Turner. Republicans have said the new Texas plan could net them an additional five seats in the state delegation.\nMost redistricting processes occur directly after the decennial census, including Texas’ original Legislature-approved map. Usually when a state draws a second map mid-decade it is as a result of a legal challenge rather than the partisan tit-for-tat that has emerged over the summer.\nDuring debate Wednesday, Republican state Rep. Todd Hunter argued that Republicans could redistrict at any time. “The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter said.\nWednesday’s vote happened weeks after state House Democrats staged a walkout to deny a quorum in the Legislature during the first session called by Gov. Greg Abbott. House Democrats returned last week for a second session that began this week.\nIn the first special session earlier this month, the Texas Senate approved a different version of a redrawn map on a 19-2 party-line vote after most Democrats refused to participate. The new plan makes major changes to the Democrat-held seats in Austin, Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where most of the state’s Democratic delegation is concentrated. Under the current map, only the seats held by Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz and Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez are rated as competitive by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales.\nDuring floor debate Wednesday in the House, Democrats argued that the plans were adopted at the behest of Trump and that it would discriminate against the state’s minority population communities.\nThere’s already an existing court challenge to the state’s first congressional map under the Voting Rights Act. It went to trial earlier this year before a three-judge panel that hasn’t yet issued a decision. Those challengers filed a motion Monday asking for the panel to consider the new map as part of their ongoing case.\nThat motion asked for a hearing next month on whether to block the new map from taking effect because the new map would discriminate against Hispanic and Latino voters.\nDemocrats have said they intend to redistrict in response. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he has started the process for the state to redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterms. The process for the state would involve passing legislation as well as a ballot initiative this fall.\nNewsom told reporters on a call Wednesday that the state would move forward with a redistricting plan as early as Thursday.\n“It’s not about whether we play hardball anymore, it’s about how we play hardball,” Newsom said.\nRepresentatives from both sides of the political aisle have pushed for more states to jump into the redistricting process. Vice President JD Vance met with Indiana leaders about redrawing the state’s map earlier this month, the Florida Legislature has formed a special committee on redistricting, and Ohio is also due to redraw its congressional districts.\nOn the Democratic side of the aisle, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has said she is exploring options for the state to redraw its lines, as has Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\nBoth California and New York have redistricting commission processes and could require a change in law to allow mid-decade redistricting."

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Texas Republicans on Wednesday took the first step toward approving new congressional maps that would give their party as many as five new seats in the House of Representatives, spurring what’s likely to be a national battle over redistricting.\nThe approval by the Texas House of Representatives came at the urging of President Donald Trump, who pushed for the extraordinary mid-decade revision of congressional maps to give his party a better chance at holding onto the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. The maps need to be approved by the GOP-controlled state Senate and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott before they become official.\nBut the Texas House presented the best chance for Democrats to derail the redraw.\nDemocratic legislators delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing Texas earlier this month in protest, and they were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday’s session.\nThe approval of the Texas maps on an 88-52 party-line vote is likely to prompt California’s Democratic-controlled state Legislature this week to approve of a new House map creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. But the California map would require voter approval in November.\nDemocrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.\nTexas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party’s interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said on the floor. After nearly eight hours of debate, Hunter took the floor again to sum up the entire dispute as nothing more than a partisan fight. “What’s the difference, to the whole world listening? Republicans like it, and Democrats do not.”\nDemocrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship.\n“In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” State Rep. Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, D.C., choose their voters.”\nState Rep. John H. Bucy blamed the president. “This is Donald Trump’s map,” Bucy said. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\nThe Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state’s map to create five new Democratic seats.\n“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.”\nA new California map would need to be approved by voters in a special election in November because that state normally operates with a nonpartisan commission drawing the map to avoid the very sort of political brawl that is playing out. Newsom himself backed the 2008 ballot measure to create that process, as did former President Barack Obama. But in a sign of Democrats’ stiffening resolve, Obama Tuesday night backed Newsom’s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP’s Texas move.\n“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party’s main redistricting arm.\nThe incumbent president’s party usually loses seats in the midterm election, and the GOP currently controls the House of Representatives by a mere three votes. Trump is going beyond Texas in his push to remake the map. He’s pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to create new Republican seats. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland’s and New York’s maps as well.\nHowever, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California's or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can’t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.\nIn Texas, there was little that outnumbered Democrats could do other than fume and threaten a lawsuit to block the map. Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.\nDemocrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas’ legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up.\nRepublicans contend the new map creates more new majority-minority seats than the previous one. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state’s House seats that will be represented by a Black representative.\nState Rep. Ron Reynolds noted the country just marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act’s passage and warned GOP members about how they’d be remembered if they voted for what he called “this racial gerrymander.”\n“Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in the body this day,” Reynolds, a Democrat, said.\nRepublicans spent far less time talking on Wednesday, content to let their numbers do the talking in the lopsided vote. As the day dragged on, a handful hit back against Democratic complaints.\n“You call my voters racist, you call my party racist and yet we’re expected to follow the rules,” said State Rep. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson. “There are Black and Hispanic and Asian Republicans in this chamber who were elected just like you.”\nHouse Republicans’ frustration at the Democrats’ flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable.

      "bias": "Lean Left",
      "text": "I represent the people of El Paso, Texas in the state legislature, a west Texas district that is a 14-hour drive away from the Louisiana border. Yet, data from the Texas Legislative Council indicates that the congressional lines Republicans are rushing through Austin manages to somehow knit 90% of the state’s white voting power across that entire expanse—while slicing Latino and Black communities into pieces so small they have little power to choose their own representatives.\nFueled by rapid Latino population growth, Texas has amassed new congressional seats. But these gains have not strengthened the political voice of the communities driving that growth. Instead, Texas Republicans have, in my view, used racial engineering to make sure Texans of color cannot meaningfully influence elections for Congress or the state legislature.\nLatinos now make up a larger share of Texas’s 31 million population than in California, the state often considered the Latino capital of America. Texas also has more Black residents than Georgia, despite Georgia’s reputation as a center of Black political power. Nearly 60% of Texans are people of color, and 95% of the state’s population growth in the past decade has come from those communities.\nDespite this reality, Texas’s new congressional lines position white voters to decide at least 26 of the state’s 38 congressional seats—putting power in the hands of white voters by design, not accident. In another three districts, a “Latino majority” exists only on paper: map-drawers split cohesive barrios, added high-turnout Anglo precincts, and minimized the share of voting-age Latino citizens, handing the keys to white voters in these districts as well. Together, the racially-engineered 26 white-majority seats—plus the three manufactured “Latino” seats—is how the federal and state government openly conspired to gain additional Republican congressional seats. But the Trump Administration’s ambitions come at the expense of Latino and Black Texans.\nHere’s the blunt math on the Texas Republican proposal: under this map, my team and I estimate it would take roughly 445,000 white residents to secure one member of Congress, but about 1.4 million Latino residents and 2 million Black residents to secure the same. In effect, the political “worth” of a Latino Texan is cut to one‑third of a white Texan’s, and for Black Texans, to one‑fifth. On paper the districts are equal in population; in practice the map assigns unequal electoral weight across racial lines. This means that the value of one Latino resident’s vote is worth just one-third the value of one white resident, and a black resident is one-fifth; it would take three Latino Texans, or five Black Texans, to equal the voting power of a single white Texan.\nRepublicans insist this is just politics. But Texas has a long, well‑documented history of crossing the line from hardball politics to what I would define as unlawful racial engineering. In 2006, the Supreme Court threw out a South Texas district for unlawfully diluting Latino voting strength after a mid‑decade redraw. Federal courts found problems with parts of the state’s 2011 maps, too. Texas operated under federal “preclearance” for decades because of past discrimination. When Shelby County v. Holder in 2013 removed that guardrail, it invited states like Texas to test the limits—passing racially engineered maps that can stand for years while litigation drags on, yielding short-term gains of up to five additional U.S. House seats.\nCourts have recently required more Black opportunity districts in Alabama and allowed a second Black district to stand for now in Louisiana, underscoring that the Voting Rights Act still means something when states overreach. Texas, meanwhile, is moving in the opposite direction.\nSome Republicans argue that growing GOP support among a subset of Latino voters in Texas justifies these lines. But even if you accept their premise, the Voting Rights Act is about opportunity, not partisan outcomes—ensuring communities of color can form districts where they have a realistic chance to elect their preferred candidates, regardless of party. Here, the state is doing the opposite: cracking and packing Latino and Black neighborhoods to reduce the number of such districts. This potential racial engineering sidelines communities of color and ensures they cannot meaningfully influence elections for Congress or the state legislature.\nIf this plan passes, Texas Latinos could become the most underrepresented racial or ethnic group in all 50 states. The level of under-representation in Texas’s proposal far exceeds the disparities that courts already forced Alabama and Louisiana to correct.\nMaps like this do not merely entrench a party; they entrench a racial hierarchy. By cracking Latino barrios and Black neighborhoods, dismantling multi-racial districts, and fine-tuning the citizen-voting-age share to keep those communities just below the thresholds where they can elect their candidates of choice, the lines ensure white voting blocs remain decisive—even inside districts labeled “Latino.” That is racial vote dilution: it denies Latino and Black Texans an equal opportunity to translate population into seats, and it teaches a generation that their ballots carry less electoral weight because of race, not ideas.\nA government that is not accountable to Latino and Black Texans teaches children early that their voices don’t count. Their families, who pay taxes, work hard, and build this state, are told their votes will be discounted by design and that representation can be rationed by color. When districts are drawn to dilute their votes, the message is that citizenship is conditional and equal protection negotiable. That is the very struggle the civil rights movement sought to end: government may not target voters based on race and then claim neutrality at the ballot box.\nWe have seen this before, from literacy tests to poll taxes—different tools, same result, keeping power just out of reach. A true democracy demands maps that make our government accountable to all of its people, not just the ones it prefers."

Watch the Texas House floor in our video player above.

Democratic legislators delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing Texas earlier this month in protest, and they were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday’s session. The approval of the Texas maps on an 88-52 party-line vote is likely to prompt California’s Democratic-controlled state Legislature this week to approve of a new House map creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. But the California map would require voter approval in November. Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month. Texas maps openly made to help GOP Texas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party’s interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes. WATCH: How partisan redistricting battles could decide the next Congress “The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said on the floor. After nearly eight hours of debate, Hunter took the floor again to sum up the entire dispute as nothing more than a partisan fight. “What’s the difference, to the whole world listening? Republicans like it, and Democrats do not.” Democrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship. “In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” State Rep. Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington, D.C., choose their voters.” State Rep. John H. Bucy blamed the president. “This is Donald Trump’s map,” Bucy said. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.” Republican Texas State Rep. David Lowe wears a button with the words “Big Beautiful Map” during a session as Democratic lawmakers, who left the state to deny Republicans the opportunity to redraw the state’s 38 congressional districts, begin returning to the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas, Aug. 20, 2025. Photo by Sergio Flores/Reuters Redistricting becomes tool nationwide in battle for US House The Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state’s map to create five new Democratic seats. “This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.” WATCH: Tamara Keith and Amy Walter on whether Democrats can overcome GOP redistricting advantages A new California map would need to be approved by voters in a special election in November because that state normally operates with a nonpartisan commission drawing the map to avoid the very sort of political brawl that is playing out. Newsom himself backed the 2008 ballot measure to create that process, as did former President Barack Obama. But in a sign of Democrats’ stiffening resolve, Obama Tuesday night backed Newsom’s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP’s Texas move. “I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party’s main redistricting arm. The incumbent president’s party usually loses seats in the midterm election, and the GOP currently controls the House of Representatives by a mere three votes. Trump is going beyond Texas in his push to remake the map. He’s pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to create new Republican seats. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland’s and New York’s maps as well. READ MORE: The other states threatening action as Texas and California’s redistricting feud intensifies However, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California’s or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can’t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval. Texas Democrats decry the new maps In Texas, there was little that outnumbered Democrats could do other than fume and threaten a lawsuit to block the map. Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice. Democrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas’ legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up. Republicans contend the new map creates more new majority-minority seats than the previous one. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state’s House seats that will be represented by a Black representative. State Rep. Ron Reynolds noted the country just marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act’s passage and warned GOP members about how they’d be remembered if they voted for what he called “this racial gerrymander.” “Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in the body this day,” Reynolds, a Democrat, said. Republicans hit back at criticism Republicans spent far less time talking on Wednesday, content to let their numbers do the talking in the lopsided vote. As the day dragged on, a handful hit back against Democratic complaints. “You call my voters racist, you call my party racist and yet we’re expected to follow the rules,” said State Rep. Katrina Pierson, a former Trump spokesperson. “There are Black and Hispanic and Asian Republicans in this chamber who were elected just like you.” House Republicans’ frustration at the Democrats’ flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable. The GOP used a parliamentary maneuver to take a second and final vote on the map so it wouldn’t have to reconvene for one more vote after Senate approval.

Debate over the legislation finished around 6:15 p.m. Wednesday.\nNow that the bill has been approved by the House, a Senate committee will discuss the legislation Thursday morning.\nThe Republican-led House was looking to create five additional GOP House seats ahead of next year's midterm election.\nRedistricting is usually only done after the U.S. census every 10 years.\nRepublicans say the new districts were drawn to maximize partisan advantage.\nDemocrats opposed the new maps, saying they're based on racial discrimination.\nThe Senate has already passed the new Congressional map.\nDig deeper:\n\"We are allowed to draw congressional districts on the basis of political performance, as recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Rucho versus Common Cause,\" said State Representative Todd Hunter, the author of the bill.\n'Racial gerrymandering' is the phrase that is repeatedly underscored by the left, claiming minority voter voices are being silenced under the redraw.\nDemocratic State Representative Ramon Romero was among several lawmakers who fired off questions on Wednesday.\nState Representative Ramon Romero asked, \"Mr. Chairman, did you do any analysis or review whether voting is racially polarized in Texas before, during, or after the drawing of this map?\"\nHowever, Rep. Hunter broke down the numbers in detail and said the new maps make four out of the five districts majority-minority Hispanic.\n\"In 2021, there were nine Hispanic majority districts,\" said Representative Hunter. \"In this plan, there are 10 Hispanic majority age districts. In the 2021 plan, there were seven Hispanic citizen voting age districts, and under this plan, there are eight.\"\n‘A new chapter of Republican unity’\nAUSTIN, TX - AUGUST 5: Speaker of the House Dustin Burrows gavels in the session in the House Chamber at the Capitol in Austin, Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025. A quorum was not present after most Democrat state representatives left Texas to break quorum and b\nSpeaker of the House Dustin Burrows (R-Lubbock) released the following statement Wednesday evening.\nWhat they're saying:\n\"The Texas House today delivered legislation to redistrict certain congressional districts to address concerns raised by the Department of Justice and ensure fairness and accuracy in Texans’ representation in Congress.\n\"I want to thank Representative Todd Hunter for carrying this bill and for his tireless efforts ensuring the new map is not only constitutional, but secures Republican representation in Congress. Led by Chairman Cody Vasut, members of the House Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting traveled across the state to hold hearings and gather input from Texans.\n\"This work has helped us deliver the legal, remedied maps Texas voters deserve. These past few weeks have not been easy, but the House members who showed up for work every day have shown a dedication to their constituents that will not be forgotten.\n\"Today’s passage of the congressional map has ushered in a new chapter of Republican unity, and I am proud to have led my colleagues in this important achievement. The other items on the special session call require the House to move past our differences, and I expect us to work together to deliver relief to Texans and implement critical safeguards to keep our children and communities safe from future disasters.\"\n‘This isn’t your grandfather’s Democratic Party’\nThe Democratic National Committee released their own statement after the passage as well.\nThe other side:\n\"This is a shame — a craven, power-hungry, unconstitutional shame. But we won’t back down, and we won’t let the old rules stop us. Republicans tore up that rule book, destroying voting rights to try to cling to power, so we refuse to play fair anymore.\n\"Texas Democrats fought every step of the way against these unlawful, rigged congressional maps and sparked a national movement. Democrats, like California’s Gavin Newsom and likely others, will carry that movement forward on behalf of Texas and the entire country.\n\"Texas Democrats forged the path and showed what it means to fight. In less than a year, the American people have become fed up with Donald Trump and his Republican circus. Costs are going up, the economy is fizzling out, and his only accomplishment is one of the worst and most unpopular pieces of legislation in modern history.\n\"No wonder he’s trying to rig the game — he knows his team can’t win next year without cheating. Make no mistake: this isn’t your grandfather’s Democratic Party. We don’t give up, we get even.\"\nRep. Salman Bhojani reacts\nDemocratic State Representative Salman Bhojani spoke with FOX 7's Katie Pratt seconds after the House adjourned on Wednesday.\n\"What's happening in Texas affects everybody,\" said State Representative Salman Bhojani. \"Five congressional seats are huge.\"\n\"I think we're passing the baton on to other states for them to continue this fight while we take this fight to the Texas House and see where we can take it to the courts,\" said Representative Bhojani. \"I'm really optimistic and I feel really good.\"\nTheir primary strategy on Wednesday was clearly about laying the groundwork, as they prepared to take their case to court.\n\"We were just trying to get the Republicans to specify how they came up with it because they have to try really hard to silence minority voices when the growth of 95% of Texas population has been in minority communities,\" said Representative Bhojani. \"We wanted to get that on the record so that we can go to the courts.\"\nTexas redistricting effort\nAUSTIN, TEXAS - AUGUST 06: A newly proposed U.S. Congressional District map is seen as the Senate Special Committee on Congressional Redistricting meets to hear invited testimony on Congressional plan C2308 at the Texas State Capitol on August 6, 202\nDig deeper:\nThe new map increases the number of congressional districts that would have voted for Trump by at least 10 percentage points by five.\nRepublicans currently control 25 of the state's 38 Congressional districts.\nThe new map makes some big changes in North Texas. It moves Democrat Rep. Marc Veasey’s district from Tarrant to Dallas County, Democrat Rep. Julie Johnson’s district moves from Dallas and Collin County to more conservative sections of East Texas, and Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett’s Dallas seat becomes one of just two majority Black districts in the entire state.\nThe Democrats claim the redrawn maps will violate the federal Voting Rights Act, but that may be difficult for them to prove.\nIn Central Texas, Democrats Greg Casar and Lloyd Doggett find their districts vastly different from the most recent map.\nThe district currently held by Casar would no longer include Travis County, while the district held by Doggett would no longer include a portion of Williamson County.\nIn Houston, the new map reshapes four currently Democrat-held districts. The biggest change to the districts would be in the seat currently held by Rep. Al Green. The new map would shift the district from covering southern Harris County and instead move it to the eastern part of the county.\nDemocratic quorum break\nThe backstory:\nDemocrats claimed victory in blocking legislation in the first special session, but that will be short-lived. Republicans plan to fast track their priorities, including redistricting and flood response legislation.\nFor two weeks, Texas Democrats blocked any legislation from reaching Gov. Abbott's desk.\nThey left the state in protest of a vote on a new congressional redistricting map that would give republicans five new seats in congress.\nNationwide impact\nWhat they're saying:\nDallas state Rep. Toni Rose said the quorum break had an impact nationwide.\n\"Gaining five seats will also impact the entire country, and we wanted to slow it down. The process was very disrespectful,\" she said.\nBut the Texas map is moving forward with a Senate committee advancing it on Sunday.\n\"We are done waiting, we have a quorum.

      "text": "Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Texas state House Republicans passed their redistricting bill Wednesday, despite staunch opposition from Democrats who describe the new maps as a power grab by President Donald ahead of next year's midterm elections that whittles away the voting power of minorities.\nTexas Republicans passed the bill 88 to 55 along party lines. The new maps are expected to give the state an extra five Republican seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\"Congrats to the Texas House on passing the One Big Beautiful Map,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement, while using language often employed by his Republican ally, Trump.\n\"It will make Texas, and Congress, a brighter shade of Red.\"\nRelated\nCongressional maps are generally redrawn once a decade based on new Census Bureau data, with the next census scheduled for 2030. Democrats are accusing the Texas Republicans of redrawing their maps now under pressure from Trump to help ensure the GOP maintains its control of the U.S. House of Representatives, where it currently holds a narrow majority, following next year's midterm elections. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats in the federal chamber.\nBecause of their minority in the state House, Democrats had no way to block passage of the redistricting bills, but they attempted to delay the vote for as long as possible and make it as politically uncomfortable for the Republicans to pass.\nRep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader, proposed an amendment to condition redistricting on Attorney General Pam Bondi releasing all unclassified records and documents in the possession of federal authorities related to the investigation of former long-time Trump friend and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died by apparent suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\nThe amendment was turned aside.\n\"Texas Republicans just protected Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein's secrets. Instead of demanding answers about Trump's decades with Epstein -- they engineered a coverup,\" Texas House Democrats said in a statement.\n\"Remember this when they talk about protecting the innocent. When given the chance, they protected predators instead.\"\nThe move is expected to set off something of a redistricting arms race, with California at the forefront, as Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has already initiated the redistricting process in order to neutralize the new five GOP Texas seats.\n\"It's on, Texas,\" Newsom said in a statement following the vote.\nOther strong blue states, including New York, may follow.\n\"Game on,\" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul replied online to news of the Texas maps passing.\nAbbott called a special session earlier this summer to specifically pass the redistricting maps, prompting Democrats two weeks ago to flee the state, denying the GOP quorum, meaning the minimum number of legislators needed to pass bills. Once the session timed out, and Abbott called a new special session, Democrats returned to the state and a new battle ensued.\nOnce Democrats came back to the capitol in Austin, they were not allowed to leave the chamber without a \"permission slip,\" a police escort and 24-hour surveillance to ensure they don't leave the state again.\nOne lawmaker, Rep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, spent Monday night in the capitol building, refusing to sign the paper. She said she planned to stay until Wednesday's session. Since then, several other Democrats tore up their waivers and joined her.\n\"This is a civil discussion and disagreement, and in order to win, the other side is willing to use force -- to use the arms of a state to get what they want. Good guys don't do that,\" Texas House Democratic Caucus leader Rep. Gene Wu, told CNN.\nWu and Rep. Vince Perez, D-El Paso, who signed the waivers, stayed with Collier through Monday night.\nThe new state map introduced last month has been revised. It would still add the five seats but also strengthen already-Republican districts by adding Republican voters to those districts. The state's current districts, passed four years ago, are already being challenged in court, and a ruling is expected this fall.\n\"Please pass this map ASAP,\" Trump posted on social media Monday. \"Thank you, Texas!\"\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, which has been railing against the maps, chastised the state's Republicans for being concerned with redistricting when they haven't passed any bills to help those affected by last month's flooding, which killed more than 135 people.\n\"Before passing any disaster relief, Gov. Abbott and his legislative allies redrew voting maps behind closed doors to further disenfranchise Black, Brown and Asian American voters,\" ACLU of Texas Executive Director Oni Blair said in a statement.\n\"It's disgraceful that Texas lawmakers chose to advance President Trump's extreme agenda while turning their backs on the thousands of families still reeling from one of the deadliest floods in state history. Every Texan deserves fair representation -- because in a democracy voters pick their leaders, not the other way around.\"\nFollowing the vote, Abbott said he is expanding the special session to pass legislation that would impose penalties on absent legislators.\n\"We will not allow the Texas Legislature to be hijacked by rogue Democrats,\" he said in a statement."

      "text": "The Texas House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a redistricting bill, paving the way for Republican-drawn maps that could net the GOP as many as five US House seats to be finalized in the coming days.\nThe 88-52 vote occurred on the heels of a more than two-week standoff with state Democrats, who blocked the bill from advancing in the first special session before returning to the state on Monday with the second special session underway.\nRepublicans are pushing forward with maps in an effort backed by President Donald Trump, who called the passage of the bill a “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!”\n“Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself. Texas never lets us down,” Trump posted on Truth Social, adding, “Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing.”\nThe bill will now move to the Senate. Once approved by the Senate, the bill will head to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who will sign the measure into law.\nThe vote came after a long line of Democrats railed against the bill, describing it as a partisan power grab that will dilute non-White voters’ influence.\nState Rep. Gene Wu, the House Democratic leader, said that voters’ “problems start right here.”\n“You may not understand gerrymandering. You may not understand redistricting,” Wu said. “But I hope you understand lying, cheating and stealing. Because this is what people do — people like Donald Trump. People like the Republican Party of Texas. When they can’t win, they cheat.”\nThe only Republican to speak during Wednesday’s heated House debate was state Rep. Todd Hunter, the sponsor of the new congressional maps. He chided Democrats for leaving the state and said that he supported the new maps in part for partisan reasons — “to give Republicans an opportunity where they haven’t in the past.”\n“This fight is far from over,” Wu said at a news conference after the House passed the congressional maps. “Our best shot is in the courts.”\nHis statement was echoed by State Rep. Nicole Collier, who had spent the night on the Texas House floor to protest a Republican demand to be placed under surveillance after a Democratic walkout.\n“Today is not the end,” Collier said at the news conference. “It is the start of a new beginning of a new Democratic party where we won’t back down, we won’t put up with their shit and we will push and push and push until we take over this country.”\nRelegated to the minority, Democrats had no viable way to stop passage of the maps, but protested GOP tactics to prevent them from leaving the state again.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows required that the quorum-breaking Democrats be placed under the around-the-clock supervision of the Department of Public Safety to be allowed to leave the House floor. However, Collier refused to do so and had been confined to the House chamber. Other Democrats on Tuesday evening ripped up the written agreements that allowed them to leave the chamber and spent the night on the House floor.\nOn Wednesday, Collier — while on a press call from a women’s restroom off the House floor ahead of the expected vote — abruptly told listeners she had to leave because “they said it’s a felony for me to do this.”\nDemocrats had hoped to put Republicans in a politically tough spot with a vote on an amendment that would block the proposed Texas congressional maps from going into effect until all files related to Jeffrey Epstein are released.\nBut Burrows announced Wednesday afternoon that the amendment requiring Epstein files to be released is not germane to the bill and thus is out of order.\nBurrows praised the passage of the new congressional map, saying in a statement it “has ushered in a new chapter of Republican unity.”\nHow were Democrats protesting?\nBurrows imposed an unusual requirement on the Democrats who ended their 15-day boycott and returned to the Capitol on Monday: They’d be released from the House floor into the custody of a Department of Public Safety officer who would ensure their return Wednesday.\nThe move came after the civil arrest warrants Burrows signed shortly after Democrats fled the state proved unenforceable outside of Texas.\nMost Democrats complied with the law enforcement escort, showing reporters what they called “permission slips” they received to leave the House floor and pointing to the officers escorting them around the Capitol.\nBut some Democrats protested. Collier refused to leave the House floor, sleeping there Monday night and planning to do so again Tuesday. Wu and Rep. Vince Perez, who signed the “permission slips” to leave with a police escort, stayed with Collier through Monday night.\nOther Democrats joined Collier and Wu on Tuesday night.\nState Rep. Penny Morales Shaw said after returning to the Houston area under police escort, she realized it was a mistake to enter into the agreement, arguing she is now “correcting course.”\n“Yesterday, I left in custody and I came back in custody, because I stand with Nicole Collier and Gene Wu,” she said. “This is illegitimate, this is a wrongful use of power, and I will not condone it, and I don’t want to be a part of setting a very bad and low precedent for future legislators.”\nObama weighs in on redistricting fight\nThe outcome of the redistricting efforts are already having major implications across the country, with several other Republican-dominated states considering following Texas’ lead with their own mid-decade redistricting efforts.\nMeanwhile, Democrats have threatened to redraw maps in states they control, such as New York and California.\nFormer President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he supported a proposal by California Democrats to redraw congressional lines, but expressed unease with the broader effects of political gerrymandering.\n“On this California issue, I want to see as a long-term goal that we do not have political gerrymandering in America. That would be my preference,” Obama said at an event Tuesday evening for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a liberal organization focused on the fight over congressional district lines, according to excerpts of his remarks shared with CNN.\nHe continued, “But I want to be very clear. Given that Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House that is effectively saying: gerrymander for partisan purposes so we can maintain the House despite our unpopular policies, redistrict right in the middle of a decade between censuses – which is not how the system was designed; I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this.”\nWhen will California Democrats vote?\nThe California Senate Appropriations committee voted 5-2 on Wednesday to advance new maps designed to give Democrats five additional seats in next year’s midterm elections.\nThe measure, known as AB604, now moves to the full Legislature for a vote, where it needs support from two-thirds of each chamber to immediately take effect. Final passage is expected Thursday and Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to sign the bill later in the day.\nMany California Republicans have acknowledged that their best chance to block the new maps are by defeating them in November. But that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers from attempting to stop the proposed constitutional amendment from making it onto the ballot.\nCalifornia Republicans filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court Tuesday requesting an emergency injunction to stop the redistricting effort on the grounds that the legislature didn’t give voters enough notice.\nState Rep. Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, also filed a proposed citizens’ initiative that would retroactively ban lawmakers who approve the constitutional amendment from running in one of the new districts.\nThe proposal mirrors a rule that bans members of the independent redistricting commission from running on maps they drew. It’s also a dig at DeMaio’s Democratic colleagues, including Mike McGuire, the senate president pro tempore. McGuire, who is term-limited, is seen as a likely candidate to run in a redrawn Northern California district under the new maps. If DeMaio and his allies gathered enough signatures, the measure would not appear before voters until 2026.\nRepublicans have also grilled Democrats over the origin of the maps, leading to tense exchanges during the Assembly’s elections committee meeting Tuesday.\n“Who drew the maps? It’s a very simple question,” state Assemblymember Alexandra Macedo, the committee’s Republican vice chair, said during the panel’s Tuesday meeting.\n“The Assembly did,” Aguiar-Curry said.\n“I’m in the Assembly, and I did not draw these maps,” Macedo responded.\nThe chair of the Assembly’s elections committee, Gail Pellerin, also declined to say who drew the maps during a gaggle with reporters Tuesday. Pellerin said it was a “collaboration” with several people.\nOne reporter asked: “When you consume something, don’t you want to know who makes it?”\n“When I go to a restaurant, I don’t need to meet the chef,” Pellerin said. “I just enjoy the food.”\nCNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Texas Republicans on Wednesday took the first step toward approving new congressional maps that would give their party as many as five new seats in the House of Representatives, spurring what’s likely to be a national battle over redistricting.\nThe approval by the Texas House of Representatives came at the urging of President Donald Trump, who pushed for the extraordinary mid-decade revision of congressional maps to give his party a better chance at holding onto the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. The maps need to be approved by the GOP-controlled state Senate and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott before they become official.\nBut the Texas House presented the best chance for Democrats to derail the redraw.\nTexas state legislative Democrats delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing the state earlier this month in protest, and were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday’s session.\nThe approval of the Texas maps on an 88-52 party-line vote is likely to prompt California’s Democratic-controlled state Legislature this week to approve of a new House map creating five new Democratic-leaning districts. Unlike in Texas, the California map would require approval by voters in November before it becomes official.\nDemocrats have also vowed to sue to challenge the new Texas map and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.\nTexas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party’s interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said on the floor. After nearly eight hours of debate, Hunter took the floor again to sum up the entire dispute as nothing more than a partisan fight. “What’s the difference, to the whole world listening? Republicans like it, and Democrats do not.”\nDemocrats said the disagreement was about more than partisanship. “In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” State Rep. Chris Turner said. “This bill flips that on its head and lets pols in Washington DC choose their voters.”\nState Rep, John H. Bucy blamed the president. “This is Donald Trump’s map,” Bucy said. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\nThe Republican power play has already triggered a national tit-for-tat battle as Democratic state lawmakers prepared to gather in California on Thursday to revise that state’s map to create five new Democratic seats.\n“This is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.”\nA new California map would need to be approved by voters in a special election in November because that state normally operates with a nonpartisan commission drawing the map to avoid the very sort of political brawl that is playing out. Newsom himself backed the 2008 ballot measure to create that process, as did former President Barack Obama. But in a sign of Democrats’ stiffening resolve, Obama Tuesday night backed Newsom’s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP’s Texas move.\n“I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,” Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party’s main redistricting arm.\nThe incumbent president’s party usually loses seats in the midterm election, and the GOP currently controls the House of Representatives by a mere three votes. Trump is going beyond Texas in his push to remake the map. He’s pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to create new Republican seats. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland’s and New York’s maps as well.\nHowever, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can’t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.\nIn Texas, there was little that outnumbered Democrats could do other than fume and threaten a lawsuit to block the map. Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.\nDemocrats noted that, in every decade since the 1970s, courts have found that Texas’ legislature did violate the Voting Rights Act in redistricting, and that civil rights groups had an active lawsuit making similar allegations against the 2021 map that Republicans drew up.\nRepublicans contend the new map creates more new minority-majority seats than the previous one they passed in 2021. Democrats and some civil rights groups have countered that the GOP does that through mainly a numbers game that leads to halving the number of the state’s House seats that will be represented by a Black representative.\nState Rep. Ron Reynolds noted the country just marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act’s passage and warned GOP members about how they’d be remembered if they voted for what he called “this racial gerrymander.”\n“Just like the people who were on the wrong side of history in 1965, history will be looking at the people who made the decisions in the body this day,” Reynolds, a Democrat, said.\nRepublicans spent far less time talking on Wednesday, content to let their numbers do the talking in the lopsided vote. Still, House Republicans’ frustration at the Democrats’ flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable.\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip before exiting. One Democrat who refused the 24-hour police monitoring, State Rep. Nicole Collier, refused to agree and was confined to the House floor since Monday night.\nSome Democratic state lawmakers joined Collier Tuesday night for what Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez dubbed “a sleepover for democracy.”\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust several Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.\n___\nRiccardi reported from Denver.

      "text": "The Texas state Senate has passed a controversial new set of congressional maps, drawing both support and criticism from political figures across the state.\nAccording to NBC News, Republicans aim to consolidate their power in Congress through the new maps, while Democrats plan to challenge the move in court, citing concerns over minority representation.\nIn a move that solidifies the political landscape, Governor Greg Abbott, an advocate of the redistricting effort, is expected to sign the plan into law shortly. The maps, which were approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, aim to increase the party's advantage by adding five more congressional seats to the GOP's tally. This legislative development comes after Democrats attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to delay the process.\nThe Senate vote came on the heels of persistent Democratic efforts to stall proceedings in the state's House of Representatives. Despite these attempts, Republicans advanced with a strategy designed to maintain their influence in an almost evenly divided U.S. Congress. Democrats argue that this redistricting undermines minority representation and disregards established redistricting timelines.\nAbbott's enthusiasm for the new maps, which have the backing of former President Donald Trump, is evident as he looks to cement Republican dominance in the state. Trump himself has remarked that the party is \"entitled\" to the additional seats under the new configuration. This redistricting would result in 30 districts won by Trump in the previous election by double-digit margins.\nThe current political arrangement sees Republicans holding 25 of Texas's 38 congressional districts. The new maps are a strategic move to bolster GOP power, reflecting the high stakes as districts are reshaped. The decision stands to affect representation significantly as the political pendulum threatens to tip further right.\nDemocratic State Senator Sarah Eckhardt voiced dissatisfaction with the process, taking to social media to call the maps disgraceful and undemocratic. Her sentiments echo wider Democratic grievances over the perceived weakening of minority political influence under the new district boundaries.\nAs Democrats prepare to challenge the redistricting in court, they emphasize the unusual timing of the map's construction. Traditionally, congressional boundaries are reevaluated every ten years, but this early attempt has drawn criticism for breaking from precedent. The redistricting, according to Democrats, is a calculated effort to secure power before the regular cycle in 2031.\nThe Senate Democratic caucus, led by Carol Alvarado, faced challenges in mounting a defense against the maps' passage. Alvarado's statement to filibuster was met with procedural hurdles, including an accusation of campaigning with state resources by Republican Sen. Charles Perry. This accusation adds another dimension to the contentious political atmosphere surrounding the redistricting.\nGov. Greg Abbott expressed his excitement over the legislative victory, stating, The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law. This statement underscores the governor’s commitment to cementing Republican influence through the new congressional configuration.\nAttention is turning to California, where Democrats are also contemplating redrawing congressional lines. This strategy mirrors Texas's approach, but it requires approval from voters in a special election. Both states highlight how redistricting efforts remain a powerful tool in American politics, subject to intense scrutiny and legal ramifications.\nWhile the Texas Senate navigated Democratic tactics with relative ease, the process showcases the intense political maneuvering surrounding redistricting. The Republican stronghold, asserting its agenda, has led to stark criticisms and promises of judicial review from opposing Democrats.\nIn summary, the redistricting in Texas is emblematic of the ongoing battle for control over congressional representation. Decisions made in state legislatures echo far beyond state borders, affecting national political dynamics. The impending legal challenges will decide whether these new maps stand, potentially reshaping the political landscape for years to come."

      "text": "Texas Legislature Passes Redistricting Map, Governor to Sign into Law | Headline USA\n(The Center Square, ) The Texas Senate passed HB 4, the state’s congressional redistricting plan, which changes nearly all districts and could flip up to five seats from blue to red.\nIt passed along party lines Friday by a vote of 18-11, according to the Senate Journal record.\nThe bill was on the first special session agenda called by Gov. Greg Abbott. After it first passed a House committee in July, more than 50 House Democrats left the state in opposition, halting legislative proceedings. A second special session was called and after more than two dozen Democrats returned to Austin, the House convened and first passed a flood relief measure. Next, they passed redistricting, both bills went to the Senate.\nAfter the Senate passed SB 4, Abbott said he will also sign it into law.\n“The One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,” Abbott said. “I promised we would get this done, and delivered on that promise. I thank Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for leading the passage in the Senate of a bill that ensures our maps reflect Texans’ voting preferences.”\nThe bill was filed after Texas’ population greatly increased since the maps were redrawn in 2021 and after voter demographics shifted more Republican since 2021. The legislature has the authority to redistrict at any time, the bill’s author, state Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, has said.\nThe plan redraws 37 of Texas’ 38 congressional districts, The Center Square reported.\nIn response to Democrats saying the bill is racist or unconstitutional, Hunter said the maps not only follow federal and state law but give a greater voice and representation to minority voters. Four of five new districts are majority minority districts, which each now trend Republican. The redistricting “doesn’t guarantee electoral success but it does allow Republicans to compete in these districts,” Hunter said.\nThe new districts are CD 9-Houston, CD 28-Rio Grande Valley, CD 32-Dallas, CD 34-Coastal Bend and CD 35-San Antonio. The new districts are primarily Hispanic majorities that lean Republican based on recent voting records, Hunter said at a hearing earlier this month, The Center Square reported.\nIn 2021, there were nine Hispanic majority voting age districts, now there are 10, Hunter said. In 2021, there were no majority Black population districts; under the new proposed plan, there are two.\nThe outcome could result in Republicans gaining five seats.\nAs Democratic governors and lawmakers in California and New York are vowing to redistrict in response to Texas’ redistricting efforts, state Rep. David Spiller, R-Jacksboro, says three states with Democratic majorities – California, New York and Illinois – already have unfair advantages.\nAny redistricting efforts they make would need to factor in population losses and better represent Republican voters to be legal, critics argue.\nIn California, 62% of voters vote Democrat, yet the state’s congressional delegation is comprised of 43 Democrats and only 9 Republicans, Spiller said. This gives California congressional Democrats an 82% advantage when Democrats have a 62% majority in the state, Spiller said at a hearing earlier this month, The Center Square reported.\nIn New York, 58% of voters vote Democrat, yet New York’s congressional delegation is comprised of 19 Democrats and 7 Republicans, giving Democrats a 73% advantage, he said.\nThe Texas Senate has passed nearly all bills on the special session call. The Texas House is moving through them with several weeks left in the session. However, House Speaker Dustin Burrows said his goal was for the House to pass them all by Labor Day weekend."

      "text": "Texas gives Republicans massive boost with adoption of new electoral map\nHouston, Texas - Texas legislators approved early Saturday a new electoral map aimed at carving out five new Republican-leaning seats in the state to help the party retain control of Congress in next year's midterm elections.\nPresident Donald Trump had pressured Republican-run Texas to create the new map to help prevent Democratic opponents from taking over the House of Representatives in 2026, halfway through his term.\nThe state senate voted along party lines to pass the map 18-11 shortly after midnight, following more than eight hours of heated debate.\nDemocratic Senator Carol Alvarado's last-ditch plans to filibuster the map were thwarted when Republicans used a rare procedural motion to halt debate, end the filibuster, and proceed directly to the final vote.\nDemocratic Senator Sarah Eckhardt said on X that shutting down a filibuster was \"unprecedented.\"\n\"This is not democracy, this is disgraceful,\" she added.\nIt now heads to Governor Greg Abbott's office, where the Republican is expected to swiftly sign it into law.\nThe bill had been adopted by the state legislature's lower chamber last week.\n\"On our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself,\" Trump said Wednesday after the bill sailed through the House. \"Texas never lets us down.\"\nThe vote caps weeks of dramatic political theater that saw Democratic lawmakers flee the state in July to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the redistricting plan, and drew nationwide attention to partisan redistricting, known as \"gerrymandering.\"\nThe exodus led to a tense standoff with Abbott threatening to have Democrats arrested upon their return.\nNew Texas map slammed as \"shameful\"\nThe Democrats claim the new electoral map dilutes the votes of African-American and Hispanic electorates who usually vote for them.\nThe Texas Senate Democratic Caucus said on X Friday that the state \"has a shameful history of racial discrimination. These maps are just the latest entry in that history.\"\nThat stance echoed in the floor debate.\nDemocratic Senator Borris Miles denounced the Republicans' complicity in \"racist actions,\" saying the new map \"does not reflect the truth of Texas, but instead manipulates and whitewashes it.\"\nBut Republican Todd Hunter hit back at the arguments, saying: \"The created four out of five new seats are Hispanic majority.\"\n\"I'm convinced that if Texas does not take this action, that there is an extreme risk that the Republican majority will be lost,\" Republican Phil King said on the floor.\n\"This map is legal in all respects,\" King said.\nThe cutthroat political gambit spurred California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, to launch a process for redrawing his state's map – this time creating five potentially new seats for Democrats.\nCalifornia leads charge of Democrats fighting back\n\"If Texas wants to play hardball, we'll play hardball right back,\" Newsom said in announcing the California initiative.\nAlthough Newsom hopes to cancel out the Republicans' advantages gained in Texas, his plan still requires voter approval in an election this November.\nBoth parties are now looking to other states where the rules might allow hasty redrawing of maps in ways that would create more seats.\nBeyond Texas, Trump encouraged Florida, Indiana, and Missouri's maps to be redrawn to Republican advantage.\nThe redistricting battle adds a volatile and high-stakes new element to next year's elections.\nRepublicans currently control both houses of Congress, and the party's legislators largely operate to carry out Trump's wishes.\nBeleaguered Democrats are hoping that the unpopularity of many of Trump's policies will help spark a takeover of the lower house. If Democrats did win, they would immediately gain power to investigate Trump and his controversial government members.\nCover photo: Brandon Bell / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / Getty Images via AFP)"

Greg Abbott, an advocate of the plan that has been welcomed by President Donald Trump.\nDemocrats have promised to challenge the measure before the court.\nTrump initially led the calls for Texas to sign his conference card again and said that his party “is entitled to” five more conference seats in the state. That is what the cards are planning to do: by again drawing the boundaries of the congress district in important cities and along the border of the State, Texas will have 30 congress districts that Trump has worn with a double digit margin last fall.\nDe Gop currently manages 25 of the 38 Congress districts of the state.\nRepublicans are determined and bone, from the start of the process that their exercise has been a political, who was exclusively aimed at increasing the power of their party in Washington, where the house is almost evenly balanced. Democrats need a net profit of only three seats in the 2026 elections to take the majority.\nDemocrats have accused the Republicans of making a dangerous precedent by waiting until 2031 to re -draw the lines, as usual, and they said that the new maps would harm the representation of minorities in the state, denied an accusation of their Republican colleagues.\nIn contrast to the State House, where the business site came to a halt earlier this month when dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny the body a quorum to continue with legislation, as a result of which Abbott forced another special session, the Senate is not obstructed by those efforts.\nThe movement was a rapid conviction of opponents of the measure.\n“This is not a democracy, this is shameful,” said Sarah Eckhardt on X.\nDemocrats were planning to push the senate voice back in the morning on Saturday in a final attempt to postpone the passage.\nEarlier, Senator Carol Alvarado, leader of the Senate Democratic Caucus, stated on social media that she intended the bill in Filibuster with a long speech and intended to speak for a few hours. But just when she expected to start, the Senate broke for a long dinner break.\nWhen the members returned, Alvarado never had the chance to be a Filibuster because Republicans accused her of violating the rules of the Senate by trying to recruit the coming filibuster in funds.\nSenator Charles Perry said it seems to be “potentially illegal, at least unethical, with the help of state resources for a campaign goal.”\nWith Abbott ready to sign the new maps in the law, the spotlights shift to California, where democratic legislators have their own proposal to again sign the congress boundaries of their state as a political retribution for the Texas movement. Unlike in Texas, where regular legislation is sufficient to change the cards, the proposal of California Democrats must also be approved by voters in a special election this fall to take effect."

      "text": "Overview:\nTexas Republican lawmakers are set to pass a new congressional map that would hand up to five additional U.S. House seats to Republicans, dismantling Democratic strongholds around Austin, Dallas, and Houston, and making two Democrat-held seats in South Texas redder. The move, which is expected to be signed into law by the governor, is part of a national redistricting war, with other blue-state governors backing retaliatory gerrymandering as the Trump administration pushes GOP-controlled states to draw more red seats. Democrats argue that the new map would increase Republicans' advantage by unconstitutionally suppressing the vote of Black and Latino Texans.\nThe Texas Senate on Friday was expected to consider a new congressional map gerrymandered to maximize Republican representation, putting the plan on a path to the governor’s desk after weeks of intense partisan clashing.\nRepublican lawmakers were poised to push the map through over fierce Democratic opposition, launching a national redistricting war from Albany to Sacramento while positioning the GOP to net up to five additional seats in Texas.\nThe map, demanded by President Donald Trump to fortify the GOP’s U.S. House majority in next year’s midterm election, would hand up to five additional U.S. House seats to Republicans by dismantling Democratic bastions around Austin, Dallas and Houston, and by making two Democrat-held seats in South Texas redder. The new lines would also keep all 25 seats already held by Republicans safely red.\nThe pickups are meant to help the GOP hold onto its razor-thin congressional majority in a midterm election year that is expected to favor Democrats — potentially making the difference between a continued Republican trifecta in Washington, or a divided government with one chamber intent on investigating Trump and bottlenecking his agenda.\nThat has put Texas lawmakers at the front lines of an issue with national stakes. Republicans earned kudos from Trump for pushing the new boundaries through the state House, while Democrats won support from national party figures, including former President Barack Obama, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin and U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\nThough congressional lines are typically redrawn once every 10 years following the decennial census, Republicans justified the aggressive and unusual move to do so in the middle of the decade by saying it was legal to craft new boundaries at any point and for purely partisan gain. They also pointed to the party’s margins of victory in 2024 and the need to counter blue-state gerrymandering to further support their push.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that states can draw electoral maps on partisan grounds. But under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the lines cannot diminish people’s voting power based on race.\nDemocrats argued that the new map would increase Republicans’ advantage by unconstitutionally suppressing the vote of Black and Latino Texans. They framed the push as a power grab by Trump meant to stack the deck in next year’s election.\nTexas’ anticipated approval of the map has set off a tit-for-tat redistricting push in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed a map voters would have to approve that could yield five new Democratic-leaning seats, effectively offsetting GOP gains in Texas. Other blue-state governors and national Democratic leaders are backing retaliatory gerrymandering as the Trump administration also pushes GOP-controlled Florida, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio to draw more red seats.\nThe new Texas map cleared its biggest hurdle Wednesday when, after more than eight hours of tense debate, the state House adopted the plan along party lines.\nLacking the votes to stop the map in the GOP-dominated Texas Legislature, more than 50 House Democrats staged a two-week walkout earlier this month, grinding the lower chamber to a halt by denying the quorum needed to conduct business.\nRepublicans unleashed an unprecedented response to drag them back to Texas, issuing civil arrest warrants, asking a court to extradite them from Illinois, seeking to declare over a dozen Democrats’ seats vacant and clamoring for legislative punishments upon their return.\nAfter most Democratic lawmakers returned to Austin Monday, Republican Speaker Dustin Burrows, seeking to maintain a quorum, required each of them to agree to a police escort to leave the Capitol building. Rep. Nicole Collier, D-Fort Worth, refused and was confined to the Capitol for the next 54 hours, prompting a national media frenzy.\nDemocrats portrayed the walkout as a victory for sparking a national movement in support of retaliatory redistricting, and as just the first part of a longer fight against the map. In the House on Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers pressed their Republican colleagues on the plan’s impact on voters of color, working to establish a record they could use in a legal challenge seeking to kill the lines before next year’s election.\n“This fight is far from over,” Rep. Gene Wu of Houston, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said after the map’s passage in the lower chamber. “Our best shot is in the courts. This part of the fight is over, but it is merely the first chapter.”\nThis post was originally published to The Texas Tribune on August 22, 2025.

      "text": "The Texas House of Representatives approved a controversial Republican-backed congressional redistricting map late Wednesday, triggering an outpouring of frustration from Democratic lawmakers who say the plan amounts to unconstitutional gerrymandering.\nThe newly drawn map could flip as many as five Democratic-held seats by merging districts in Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Austin into GOP-leaning territory, while also making two Rio Grande Valley districts more competitive. Democratic Reps. Al Green, Marc Veasey, Julie Johnson, Greg Casar, and Lloyd Doggett are among those whose districts could be threatened.\nRepublicans advanced the measure on a party-line vote, setting the stage for expected litigation. Democratic leaders have already vowed to challenge the maps in federal court, arguing they violate protections under the Voting Rights Act by diluting the political strength of communities of color.\nIn the hours after the vote, Democratic Rep. Nicole Collier delivered an impassioned response from the House floor.\n“Look, I’m not gonna lie. I want to cry. But I’m too angry,” Collier said. “My feet hurt, my back aches, but I think about the people who have no home, who have no bed to sleep in, who have no job to work at. I think about the people who don’t earn livable wages. I think about the people who don’t have healthcare. I can fix my back. But what are we gonna do for them? … The fact that I’m still mad, angry and furious means that I still want to fight.”\nCollier, who remained inside the Capitol alongside colleagues during marathon deliberations, framed the battle over redistricting as larger than one legislative fight.\n“Today is not the end. It is the start of a new beginning of a new Democratic Party where we won’t back down. We won’t put up with that. And we will push and push and push until we take over this country,” she declared.\nLegal scholars note that while mid-decade redistricting is not explicitly prohibited under federal law, it is unusual and often subject to constitutional scrutiny. Previous challenges to Texas maps have reached the U.S. Supreme Court, with mixed outcomes depending on the balance between claims of racial gerrymandering and partisan redistricting.\nThe bill now heads to the Texas Senate and, if approved, will be sent to Gov. Greg Abbott, who has signaled strong support. Abbott has also said he will propose legislation to penalize lawmakers who deny quorum in future sessions, a move Democrats describe as retaliatory.\nWith litigation expected once the maps are signed into law, the political and legal showdown over representation in Texas appears far from over."

In firm control of both legislative houses and the governorship, the brazen political move is intended to secure additional seats in the House of Representatives in order to retain Republican control through next year’s Congressional mid-terms. In response, the blue state of California has undertaken an effort to turn its Congressional roster five seats bluer to counteract Texas.\nPredictably, other states are threatening to do the same with the same motives. Blue states blame red, red states blame blue, for starting the redistricting frenzy. Where does this end?\nShould it? If you would like to weigh in, visit the right side of our page to answer the new Pelican Poll.\nTwo states (Texas-GOP and California-Democrats) are overtly gerrymandering Congressional district to favor a party. Should this practice be allowed?\nRuby red Louisiana Freedom Caucus Chair Beryl Amedee wrote (August 18, 2025):\nRed states should seize this moment. By redistricting to maximize Republican representation—creating competitive districts that reflect our majorities—we can counter blue-state imbalances. This isn’t about suppressing votes; it’s about equilibrium. Proportional maps in red states could rightly add dozens of GOP seats, empowering conservatives to advance the America First agenda of border security, fiscal responsibility, and family values.\nWhatever happened to the old “one-man, one vote” maxim?\nThe Founding Fathers saw all of it coming, several of them warning about the rampant factionalism engendered by political parties.\n“”They serve to organize factions … to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority…. Let me … warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party….” (George Washington’s Farewell Address, referring to “all combinations and associations”)\nThe Federalist Papers (Nos. 9/10) took up the subject at length.\nConsidering the stranglehold that the parties enjoy over the political process, most poignantly in various states on either side of the political spectrum, it may come as a surprise that more than half of every registered in the nation does not belong to either of the major parties. “Of registered voters, 47% have declared a party affiliation. As of September 2024, 36 million voters are registered Republicans and 45.1 million are registered Democrats.” (USA Facts).\nIn Louisiana (according to the Secretary of State):\n- 36.9% of voters are registered Democrat\n- 35.0% are Republican\n- 27.9% are “other”\nYet, the red team clearly holds the upper hand just as the blue team does in other states."

The roughly two dozen Texas Democrats who returned to Austin on Monday said they were starting the next phase of their fight: putting the screws on their Republican colleagues and establishing a record that could be used in a legal challenge to the map.\nRepublicans have said the new districts were drawn purely to maximize their partisan advantage, arguing that the GOP’s margins of victory in 2024 supported new lines that entrenched their hold on power. They have also framed the effort as a response to Democratic gerrymandering elsewhere.\nRep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi and the map’s sponsor, emphasized in laying out House Bill 4 that Republicans were legally permitted to pursue redistricting in the middle of the decade and to maximize partisan gain.\n“Redistricting can be done at any point in time,” he said. “The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance.”\nTo create up to five Republican pickup opportunities, the map dismantles Democratic strongholds around Austin, Dallas and Houston and makes Democrat-held seats in South Texas redder — all without seriously jeopardizing any of the 25 districts Republicans already control. The proposed map also would push a handful of Democratic members of Congress into seats already represented by other Democrats, setting up possible primary battles between long-serving members of the Texas delegation and younger newcomers.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that states can draw electoral maps on partisan grounds. But under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the map cannot diminish the voting power of people of color.\nDemocrats condemned the plan, arguing it widens Republicans’ partisan edge by unconstitutionally packing people of color — who are driving almost all of Texas’ population growth — into some districts while spreading them throughout others to reduce their ability to elect their preferred candidates.\n“This bill represents one of the most blatant assaults on fair representation we have seen in Texas,” Rep. Ana Hernandez, D-Houston, said. “Diversity is our greatest strength. It is what makes our neighborhoods vibrant, our workforce dynamic and our communities resilient. HB 4 silences that diversity instead of celebrating it.”\nAmong the first points Democrats sought to make Wednesday was that the congressional map was the first piece of legislation the House was voting on, rather than flood-related bills responding to the devastating Hill Country floods. Several Democrats wore dark green in honor of the flood victims.\n“Why was House Bill 1, the flood relief bill that is the House’s answer to the deadly July 4 flooding that killed over 135 people, not the first order of business of this special session for the Texas House?” Rep. Gina Hinojosa, D-Austin, asked on the floor.\nRepublicans shot down all 12 amendments Democrats proposed to the bill, including measures to block the map’s implementation until the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and until a federal court found that the plan would not suppress the vote of people of color.\nRepublicans reject all 12 Democratic amendments to congressional map\nRepublicans shot down 12 Democrat-proposed amendments Wednesday, including measures to block the map’s implementation until the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, until the establishment of an independent redistricting commission and until a federal court found that the plan would not suppress the vote of people of color.\nThe GOP-led House also rejected amendments to use the state’s current congressional map if the new lines are held up in court, and to only implement the new map within two years of the decennial census.\nIn proposing each amendment, Democrats sought to stretch out the debate and press their Republican colleagues on how race was considered in drawing the lines, in an effort to establish a record that they could bring to court in challenging the map on constitutional grounds.\nDemocrats tried to highlight the plan’s possible impact on people of color — who they argued will see their vote diluted under the new lines — and the fact that Republicans were redrawing the map in the middle of the decade, using five-year-old census data.\nThe map is “a clear violation of the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,” said Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, after raising an amendment to sink the map. “This body has no business passing this bill. We need to kill it and get on with the real business of the people of this state.”\nRepublicans sink amendment seeking to tie map to release of Epstein files\nAn amendment from Democratic Rep. Gene Wu of Houston that sought to tie the implementation of the new congressional map to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files was found to be not germane to the redistricting bill after another representative contested it, effectively killing the attempt to put Republicans in a political bind.\nWu said Wednesday morning he planned to introduce the amendment to force Republicans “to choose between their loyalty to Trump and their obligation to expose sexual predators.” But members ultimately did not debate the amendment or vote on it following the procedural challenge from Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, that was sustained by the House parliamentarian.\n“The bill changes the composition of districts for the election of members to the United States House of Representatives,” Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said, reading the parliamentarian’s ruling. “The Wu amendment makes the effective date of the bill contingent on a matter that is not even remotely related to the congressional redistricting.”\nRepublicans have successfully quashed all 11 amendments Democrats have so far tried to tack onto the bill.\nHouse rejects amendment saying the map complies with the Voting Rights Act\nThe House voted down an amendment offered by Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, to add a section to the bill saying that the map complies with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination against voters on the basis of race.\nThe vote to reject the amendment was 87 to 51, along party lines.\nRep. Todd Hunter, the map’s Republican sponsor, opposed the amendment, saying that the bill already complies with the Voting Rights Act.\n“It’s unnecessary, and guess what? It’s incorporated in this bill,” he said.\nThe debate over the amendment grew heated at times, as Rep. Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, D-San Antonio, pressed Hunter on the lack of public input allowed on the map and its impact on Black and Latino voters.\n“You own the walkout,” Hunter said to applause from Republicans, referring to Democrats’ two-week departure from the state to block action on the map. “But don’t come into this body and say we didn’t involve you. You left for 18 days, and that’s wrong.”\nMartinez Fischer argued that if the map’s proponents were certain it complied with the Voting Rights Act, they should have no problem voting in favor of the amendment.\n“It just says that we are going to follow Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,” he said. “That’s it. There are no tricks. There are no hidden words. That’s all it does. It shouldn’t be controversial.”\nProtesters gather in Capitol rotunda\nAs the Texas House began its anticipated and delayed debate on congressional redistricting, dozens of protesters gathered in the Capitol rotunda and their chants at times seeped into the chamber, albeit faintly.\nThe demonstrators rallied support for Rep. Nicole Collier, a Fort Worth Democrat who has been on the floor of the Texas House since Monday afternoon after she refused to sign a permission slip allowing members to leave the chamber only if they agreed to be shadowed by state law enforcement officers.\nCollier is among the Democrats who participated in a two-week walkout to delay passage of a new congressional map that aims to give the GOP five additional seats in the 2026 midterms.\n“Let her out,” the protesters chanted, some holding a giant banner that read “Put Texans First.”\nWu to propose amendment making map conditional on Trump’s release of Epstein files\nRep. Gene Wu of Houston, chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, intends to try blocking the new congressional map from going into effect until President Donald Trump releases the files of disgraced billionaire and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe lower chamber is expected to vote later Wednesday on the proposed map pushed by Trump, which redraws districts with the aim of getting the GOP five more seats in the U.S. House. In a statement, Wu said he plans to introduce an amendment that would make the maps conditional on Trump releasing all “investigations, prosecutions, or custodial matters” related to Epstein. The goal, Wu said, is to force Republicans “to choose between their loyalty to Trump and their obligation to expose sexual predators.”\nThe files related to Epstein, who died in federal prison while awaiting trial, have long been the source of conspiracy theories.

Greg Abbott’s desk.\nTEXAS DEMS END WEEKSLONG QUORUM STANDOFF IN REDISTRICTING FIGHT\nAbbott pushed for the creation of a new map to adhere to President Donald Trump’s desire to not see a repeat of the 2018 election cycle, when Democrats handily regained the majority in the House and acted as a foil to the president’s legislative desires toward the end of his first term.\nWhile Republicans control a supermajority in deep-red Texas and already passed the map through the state Senate, Democrats still needed to create a quorum in the House to actually move the process along.\nDozens of Texas Democrats fled the state to stall the process, creating a national media frenzy and generating support from Democratic donors, including groups linked to George Soros and Beto O’Rourke, to help pay for their fines, travel and lodging.\nIt generated pushes to have them arrested by Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as a request from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to have the FBI track them down and the DOJ to launch an investigation into the political action committees funding their escape.\nO’ROURKE, SOROS-LINKED GROUPS FACE CALL FOR DOJ PROBE OVER ALLEGED FUNDING OF TEXAS DEM WALKOUT\nDemocratic leaders announced Monday they would return for the second special session following California’s plan to redraw its maps to soften the blow from the Lone Star State, ending the blockade and allowing Republicans to charge ahead.\nTexas House Democrats accused the GOP of crafting a map that was illegal and racially discriminatory, and they tried and failed on the House floor to add amendments to the bill that would have halted the process. Despite Democrats’ best efforts, Texas House Republicans shot down a dozen amendments to the bill.\n“Members, it breaks my heart to see how this illegal and rigged, mid-decade redistricting scheme is dividing our state and our country,” Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat, said. “This is Texas, it’s not Washington D.C. The impulses of outside politicians and their billionaire backers shouldn’t dictate what we do in this chamber, in this House.”\nRep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who wrote the bill for the new map, countered that four of the five new districts were “majority-minority Hispanic,” noting that each of the new districts now trended Republican. Still, he had no qualms as to why Republicans were pursuing changes to the congressional maps.\n“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward, [to] improve Republican political performance,” he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Democrats’ blockade ended on Monday, when Abbott called for a second special session after their demands for California to also begin a redistricting cycle were met in an effort to nullify the map Texas Republicans were creating.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Democrats unveiled their new map last week, which, if passed, would create five new Democratic-leaning congressional districts that would counteract the Texas legislature’s new map."

Despite widespread outcry, state lawmakers advanced the latest maps without providing an opportunity for public input. Community members and voting rights advocates across Texas have raised concerns that the new maps weaken fair representation and dilute the power of voters of color.\nThe following quote can be attributed to Oni Blair (she/her), executive director of the ACLU of Texas:\n“Before passing any disaster relief, Gov. Abbott and his legislative allies redrew voting maps behind closed doors to further disenfranchise Black, Brown, and Asian American voters. It’s disgraceful that Texas lawmakers chose to advance President Trump’s extreme agenda while turning their backs on the thousands of families still reeling from one of the deadliest floods in state history. Every Texan deserves fair representation — because in a democracy, voters pick their leaders, not the other way around.”"

      "text": "By Mel Wilson, NASW Senior Policy Advisor\nTexas lawmakers have made a decision that is a deeply troubling afront to voting rights. Its aggressive and unprecedented gerrymandering strategy that — if it comes to fruition — challenges the fundamental principles of representative democracy.\nThe redistricting plan — the brainchild of the Trump administration and quicky agreed to by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott — was presented to the public as a routine redrawing of the state’s electoral map. However, that presentation is purposefully misleading.\nThe true motivation for the Trump administration and the state of Texas to move forward with redistricting, which allows states to reapportion Congressional representation, is blatantly and unambiguously political.\nIn the same vein, it is telling that neither President Trump nor Gov. Abbot is shy about the political nature of their actions. For example, in July 2025, Trump responded to a questions about the Texas redistricting plan by saying, “[it’s] Just a simple redrawing we pick up five seats.” Governor Abbot has made similar comments that enthusiastically embraces a political objectives for redistricting. There is little doubt that they both see this strategy as an effective counter-offensive to the vulnerability of the Republicans with respect to losing the House majority in the 2026 midterm elections.\nAs an aside, it is important to note that the constitution mandates states to initiate and complete redistricting plans at a time that coincides with the national census, which is every 10 years . Given that the next official census is five years away, for Texas to redistrict this year is very much out of the ordinary. However, there are no constitutional prohibitions preventing states from redrawing district maps in between the 10-year official national census.\nThat said, on the surface, this could be misconstrued as a run-of-the-mill political skirmish. In reality, the Texas redistricting plan raises profound concerns about the erosion of fair political representation. By manipulating district boundaries to entrench partisan power and dilute the voting strength of communities of color, Texas risks disenfranchising millions of its residents and distorting the will of the electorate. Too many, these tactics take the country down the path of a moral and constitutional crisis, thereby threatening the integrity of democratic governance in the entire nation.\nIs it Racial Gerrymandering or Partisan Gerrymandering?\nThere has been a concerted effort on the part of Texas’ Republican leadership to portray their mid-cycle redistricting initiative as being partisan gerrymandering as opposed to racial gerrymandering. Making this distinction is critically important to Gov. Abbott if he wants to avoid a court ruling — by the Supreme Court — that the state’s new map reflects a designed intent to disenfranchise Black and Latino voters. Relatedly, in that the Supreme Court essentially (in 2019) ruled that partisan gerrymandering did not violate the Voting Rights Act, Texas leadership feel they have legal cover by insisting their new district maps are “race blind.”\nImpact on Black and Brown Congressional Representation\nIn truth, the decision of Texas to gerrymander its districts has many characteristics of what is defined as racial gerrymandering. Consequently, Texas’ new redistricting maps will certainly have a significant impact on t Black and Brown legislators representing the state in Congress. This is because the targeted gerrymandering tactic is designed to reshape districts in such a way as to dilute the voting power of these communities. The newly drawn maps will collapse historically Black and Latino districts into one another.\nFor example, Houston’s 29th District — which is heavily Latino—would no longer be majority Latino, effectively erasing its cultural identity and political influence. As a result, assuming the redistricted maps go into effect, Democrats could wind up with only 8 of Texas’ 38 congressional seats — down from the current 13 seats.\nAccording to State Rep. Vince Perez (D-El Paso), the proposed Texas district map allocates a ratio of one congressional seat for every 430,000 white resident. This compares with one seat for every 1.2 million Latino residents, and one congressional seat for every 2 million Black residents. The result is this disproportionate allocation is that Latino voters would have one-third the voting power of white voters, and Black voters just one-fifth — all of which suggests racial gerrymandering as opposed to partisan gerrymandering.\nDespite these facts, Texas Republican political leaders are unrelenting in their insistence that they are embracing a partisan gerrymandering approach with a goal of gaining political advantage. They have convinced themselves that their approach is “race blind” . On the contrary, Democrats and voting rights advocates are firm in their belief that Texas’ new map undermines the political influence of Black and Latino communities and violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 .\nTexas Redistricting Reflects a Broader Trump Administration Plan to Retain Power\nThe underlying impetus for Texas’ redistricting actions is the Trump Administration’s deep fear that Republicans will lose control of the House in 2026 . As referred to earlier, it was Trump’s outreach to Gov. Abbott that put the Texas gerrymandering plan in motion. It was lost on no one — especially Texas and national Democrats— that redistricting is about political power, and the battleground is at a national level. This is a worrisome concern for those opposed to the Trump administration’s hold on power—which they see as a threat to democracy. Therefore, opponents are mobilizing against the Texas gerrymandering move with an eye on the probability that they will have to fight the same battle in a number of other Republican States.\nIn many ways, the Democratic members of Texas legislature are on the frontlines of what could be an extremely fraught point in time for our democracy. Their commitment to voting equity helps to remind us that the upcoming elections are profoundly important. It is no secret that the Trump administration and the far-right are themselves fully mobilized with detailed strategic plans to — by any means necessary— control the mid-term outcomes to strongly favor Republicans.\nThe Texas gerrymandering effort is only one of what is sure to be many schemes —such as voting suppression, voter intimidation and other similar tactics— that will be initiated by the Trump administration in the coming months. We can rest assured that the Trump administration’s campaign to undermine the next election is already geared up and mobilized in every state in the union.\nLegal Consequences\nTexas gerrymandering is a microcosm of a broader Trump administration plan to manipulate the outcomes of the 2026 mid-term elections. The success of that plan is dependent on the outcomes of critical legal court challenges to past and present election protection laws.\nTo add historical context to this issue, gerrymandering —in particular, racial gerrymandering— rose in prominence in the South shortly after Reconstruction ended. Gerrymandering and other voting suppression strategies were in response to the fact that formerly enslaved men outnumbered white men in many voting districts in the South — this dramatically shifted the balance of real and potential political power in those districts during Reconstruction. Once Reconstruction was removed as a forceful obstacle, white southerners used every available method to prevent Black men from voting— including racial gerrymandering. Other efforts to solidify their grip on electoral power included:\n- Between 1890 and 1908, Southern states rewrote constitutions and passed laws to make voter registration more difficult and often administered in discriminatory ways.\n- These laws were crafted to appear race-neutral but were implemented to target Black voters specifically, skirting the Fifteenth Amendment.\nThis widespread practices of racial (and partisan redistricting) flourished unchecked in the South for close to 100 years before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was passed. However, more recently the Voting Rights Act has come under attack via court challenges. The first of those cases (in 2013) was Shelby County v Holder which shockingly gutted key voter protection provisions in the VRA. Subsequently there have been other similar court challenges including:\nRucho v, Common Cause: Unfortunately, the protections against all forms of gerrymandering encountered a major stumbling block in 2013 when the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) gutted essential enforcement provision from the VRA. Ironically, even though the 2013 ruling seriously weakened VRA, the protection against gerrymandering remained intact. That was the case until 2019 when SCOTUS ruled— with a specific focus on partisan gerrymandering — in Rucho v. Common Cause. In that ruling, SCOTUS said that federal courts, including SCOTUS, did not have jurisdiction over partisan gerrymandering. The Court further stated that such cases must be resolved in state courts and legislatures. Significantly, the 2019 Rucho v Common Cause decision allowed racial gerrymandering to remain outlawed under the protection of VRA.\nThe decision in this case effectively removed federal oversight of partisan gerrymandering. With the guardrails down, it has since emboldened aggressive redistricting efforts in states like Texas, where one party controls the process. Legal challenges to gerrymandering now rely on state constitutions and courts, which vary widely in their protections and interpretations.\nLouisiana v. Callais: With respect to racial gerrymandering, there is a pending and soon to be decided SCOTUS voting rights case that could scuttle all other remaining race-based protections in VRA. Louisiana v. Callais challenges the long-standing use of Section 2 of the VRA, which prohibits voting practices that dilute the power of racial minorities. If the Court rules that creating districts that are based on race—even if it was designed to remedy past discrimination—is unconstitutional, it could gut Section 2 and end federal protections against racial gerrymandering. The fear is that in Texas even one election cycle under the new gerrymandered maps could result in diminished representation for Black and Brown communities in that state — making it harder to elect leaders from those communities who reflect their constituents’ priorities.\nA Gerrymandering Arms Race?\nThe political consequences of a looming and perhaps an inevitable “gerrymandering arms race” involving both Democratic and Republican states is reshaping the national political landscape in significant and potentially disruptive ways. More to the point, unrestricted freedom to gerrymander voting district maps is deeply problematic and leads to abuses. More troubling, such abuses often becomes pervasive when one political party has sole control of the process. Under single-party control, there is a likelihood that transparency will become inadequate, resulting in a severe absence of fair representation of the public as a whole. Other concerns are:\n- Polarization intensifies: With fewer swing districts, candidates cater to their base rather than the center, fueling ideological extremism.\n- Public trust erodes: As voters perceive the system as rigged, faith in democratic institutions declines.\nIt must be understood that a “gerrymandering arms race” is not simply a technical “food fight” over district lines. Texas democrats and the national Democratic leadership acknowledge that mass gerrymandering could be the potentially destructive, However, these same leaders take the position that there is an imperative that the Democrats adopt the counteraction redistricting Democratic states —to do otherwise would capitulate in a battle over the soul of representative democracy.\nThe following quote better articulates national voting rights organizations’ position on this dilemma:\nIn the current mid-decade redistricting battle, we recognize that President Trump and Republican leaders are pursuing a calculated, asymmetric strategy to redraw districts mid-decade in states like Texas, to lock in unaccountable power and silence voters. This is not an isolated political tactic; it is part of a broader march toward authoritarianism, dismantling people-powered democracy, and stripping away the people’s ability to have a political voice and say in how they are governed.\nWe therefore will not condemn countermeasures that meet our fairness criteria. And we will oppose countermeasures that do not meet our criteria. We have established these fairness criteria so we can respond to the most urgent threats to fair representation while holding all actors to the same principled standard: people—not parties—first. This moment is not only about countering immediate threats.- Common Cause- August 2025\nConclusion\nIt is a foregone conclusion that Texas will create and submit a mid-cycle redistricting map that will increase the state’s Congressional delegation by 5 representatives. As concerning as that is, it would be more disturbing if we view the Texas action as isolated “one-off” occurrence — it decidedly is not. The statement by Common Cause captures the urgency of the situation in terms of Texas being one cog in the gears that are driving the far-right’s unrelenting mission to win the mid-term election— ignoring any notions of fairness and integrity.\nIn some ways, the far-right and the Trump administration would be happy to have election integrity advocates— and the American public — focus on Texas’ gerrymandering, Their hope is that the opposition will then lose focus on the far-right’s ongoing overall strategic plan to move forward with – in addition to gerrymandering – voting suppression, voter intimidation and outright lies to achieve their goals. The voting rights battleground is multi-faceted and expansive. The civil and voting rights communities must not lose sight of this truism.\nIn the long run, as matter of principle, gerrymandering as a tool for gaining political power is wrong. The practice has an ugly history of disenfranchising African American and other communities of color and suppressing fair and guaranteed access to the ballot. Disappointingly, the U.S. Congress has rejected two pieces of legislation that would address this issue:\n- The Freedom to Vote Actsought to bar partisan gerrymandering nationwide. It also would have banned mid-decade redistricting and set other national standards — and made it easier and faster for voters to win relief.\n- The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Actwould have strengthened protections against racially discriminatory maps.\nThese landmark bills came very close to enactment in 2022. Together they would stop what is happening today. In the meantime, the Democratic leadership and the civil and voting rights communities have no other choice but to take the counter-offensive of redistricting Democratic-led states to offset the advantage in the House that Gov. Abbott and other red state governors will gain with their gerrymandering strategy."

      "text": "The Texas House passed its proposed congressional redistricting map Wednesday night on a final vote of 88 to 52, after holding a preliminary vote, adjourning, and starting a new legislative day. The map will now proceed to the Senate for consideration.\nThe vote followed a fierce debate that stretched over eight hours, coming just two days after the chamber reestablished a quorum with the return of Democratic representatives.\nState Rep. Todd Hunter (R-Corpus Christi) authored the House bill, but he claimed not to know who drew the map – only that it came from the same law firm, Butler Snow, that advised him as to the map’s legality. He repeatedly pointed to a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Rucho v. Common Cause, which held that partisan gerrymandering in redistricting is beyond the reach of federal courts.\n“Redistricting can be at any point in time, and I want everybody to know this.” Hunter said. “You want transparency? Here's the U.S. Supreme Court legal transparency. The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance.”\nHunter’s transparency didn’t go over well as several Democrats lined up to question him on exactly why the districts were drawn in a manner they say dilutes the votes of minorities.\nOutside of the chamber, in the Capitol building rotunda, a protest was taking place. Activists, congressmen and everyday Texans filled the rotunda, at times chanting, giving speeches and constantly holding up a large black and white sign reading, “END GERRYMANDERING SAVE DEMOCRACY.”\nBack in the House chamber, Hunter made an argument for the need for a new congressional map. He said that some of the current congressional districts had been drawn as minority coalition-opportunity districts – that is, districts drawn to elect representatives of a coalition of different non-white racial or ethnic groups.\nHe cited a recent ruling of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, Petteway v. Galveston County, to argue that minority coalition districts are not allowed under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That case remains under dispute.\nHunter argued that four out of the five new congressional districts are majority Hispanic. State Rep. Armando Walle (D-Houston) countered that, in splitting up Houston’s Congressional District 29, that district – originally drawn as an Hispanic-opportunity district – would no longer have an Hispanic majority.\n“The political performance in 29 stays Democrat,” Hunter said.\nHunter identified five specific congressional districts now held by Democrats as targeted for Republican pickup: Congressional Districts 9 (U.S. Rep. Al Green, Houston), 28 (U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, Laredo), 32 (U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, Farmers Branch), 34 (U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, McAllen), and 35 (U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, Austin).\nHunter said he had chosen to update the map following the Democratic quorum break, on his own initiative and in consultation with legal counsel, in order to increase Republican performance.\nState Rep. Gina Hinojosa (D-Austin) was one of several Democratic lawmakers who sought to point out that there had not been a single opportunity for the public to weigh in on the map lawmakers were preparing to vote on.\nHunter responded to each such argument by saying the majority Republicans were under no obligation to hold such hearings, although they had held four lengthy public hearings to take testimony during the first special session.\n“You’re not going to like this, but for 18 days, things could have happened. You all chose to walk out. To me, you damaged the process. You kept people away. You kept work from being done,” Hunter told House Democrats. “Don’t use that as an excuse to belabor this bill.”\nDemocrats argue the map is racial gerrymandering, not just partisan\nDemocrats largely focused their opposition to the map on charges that it is racially discriminatory and that it allows lawmakers to pick their voters rather than the other way around.\nState Rep. Chris Turner (D-Grand Prairie) attempted unsuccessfully to attach an amendment that would have struck the bill’s enacting clause, killing it. He argued that Hunter’s claim the bill’s goal was purely partisan gain was disingenuous.\n“This bill intentionally discriminates against Black and Hispanic Texans and other Texans of color by cracking and packing minority communities across the state of Texas,” Turner said. “We are in a turning point for our democracy if we allow cheating – and that's what this is, it's cheating – elections will no longer reflect the will of the people in a democracy,”\nState Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer (D-San Antonio) unsuccessfully sought to attach an amendment requiring the bill to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which forbids racial discrimination in redistricting.\n“This seems to be just a debate about red shirts versus blue shirts, and that is not how this process works,” Martinez Fischer said.\nMartinez Fischer also unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill so that – if, as expected, the proposed map faces a court challenge - that Texas’ 2021 congressional redistricting map would apply until that court challenge is resolved.\nSimilarly, state Rep. Harold Dutton (D-Houston) unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill to require an explicit federal court ruling that the redistricting map does not discriminate against Black and Latino voters. Hunter argued against the amendment on the ground that the Supreme Court had struck down the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act.\nState Rep. Donna Howard (D-Austin) unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill by barring the map from taking effect until after the state had established an independent redistricting commission.\n“Members, what is happening on the floor today is a blatantly obvious attempt to determine the outcome of the upcoming midterm election before a single vote is cast,” Howard said. “HB 4 is a blatant attempt by a handful of elected officials to choose their voters because they are afraid their voters won’t choose them.”\nHouse Minority Leader Gene Wu (D-Houston) unsuccessfully attempted to box Republicans in by proposing an amendment that would attach a trigger to the redistricting plan, allowing it to go forward only with the complete release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSpeaker of the House Dustin Burrows ruled Wu’s amendment not germane to the bill, following a motion by Rep. Briscoe Cain (R-Deer Park).\n“[President Donald] Trump is in those files, and that's why he's fighting to keep them hidden,” Wu said in a statement issued ahead of the House debate. “This amendment forces Republicans to choose between their loyalty to Trump and their obligation to expose sexual predators.”\nUltimately, Democrats proposed 12 amendments, with all of them either being tabled, withdrawn, or ruled not germane to the bill.\nThe Democratic walkout and its role in the map’s construction\nHouse Democrats had managed to stall passage of the map for more than two weeks by scattering out of state. They drew national attention to the issue, prompting several Democratic-led states – most notably California – to pursue their own redistricting efforts to neutralize the effect of Texas’ move as far as the balance of power in Congress goes.\nHowever, in the Texas House itself, the immediate effect was to push at least one redesigned seat further into the Republican column.\nOn Monday, following the meeting of the full House, the chamber’s select committee on congressional redistricting rapidly approved a new map designed to flip five congressional seats from Democratic to Republican control in the 2026 midterm elections.\nThe House map differed from the version it had considered in the first special session – and from the version still being weighed by the Texas Senate – primarily in that it would redraw the Houston-centered Congressional District 9 to include largely rural and conservative Liberty County. That would likely complete the task of shifting TX-9 from a solidly Democratic district to a solidly Republican one.\n“At the end of the day one chamber will have to approve the other’s map or they will need to iron it out in conference committee,” said Michael O. Adams, a political science professor at Texas Southern University."
