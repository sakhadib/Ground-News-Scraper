      "text": "The US government can take another 5pc stake in Intel if the company stops owning at least 51pc of its foundry business.\nIntel is giving the US government a 9.9pc stake in the company, selling 433.3m primary shares at a price of $20.47 per share, which comes to approximately $8.9bn. The New York Times reports that this is one of the largest government interventions in a US company since the 2008 financial crash.\nThe government’s equity stake will be funded by the remaining $5.7bn in grants previously awarded – but not yet paid – to Intel under the US Chips Act. While the remaining $3.2bn will be awarded to Intel as part of the Secure Enclave programme.\nUS president Donald Trump seems to prefer investments over providing grants and subsidies to semiconductor companies in the US. He has made his opinions on the Chips Act clear, calling to “get rid” of the Biden-era legislation.\n“We don’t have to give them money,” Trump said in March. “We just want to protect our businesses and our people and they will come because they won’t have to pay tariffs if they build in America.”\nOver the past few months, the Trump administration has pressured chipmakers to increase their investments in the US in order to receive the roughly $36bn in grants promised by the previous government. Intel was promised up to $10.9bn of these grants.\nHowever, financial filings from Intel showed that the US government was withholding some of the federal grants owed to the company.\nAccording to this new deal, the nearly $8.9bn investment into Intel by the US government is in addition to the $2.2bn in Chips Act grants that Intel has received to date, which comes instead of the grants awarded to the company, taking the total US investments in the company to more than $11bn.\nMoreover, in addition to the nearly 10pc stake, the US government is entitled to another 5pc stake in Intel’s common shares if the company ceases to own at least 51pc of its foundry business.\nIn a statement last Friday (22 August), Intel CEO Lip Bu-Tan said: “As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the US, Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made.\n“We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel”.\nThe US government will be a passive owner in Intel, with no board representation or any other governance or information rights.\nThe deal came together rather swiftly. Earlier this month, Trump called for Tan’s resignation on social media, after US senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to Intel’s board complaining that Tan “controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms”, some of which he claimed had “ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army”.\nDays later, the new Intel CEO (who took over earlier this March), met with the president, and the meeting seemed to have gone well.\nThough things have steamrolled since, with Japanese investment giant SoftBank announcing a $2bn investment into Intel just last week. Now, with the government buying a 10pc stake in the company, it seems that companies such as Intel are simply too big to fail – or let fail.\nFollowing the announcement on Friday (22 August), US president Donald Trump said: “[Tan] walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10bn for the United States.”\n“It’s a great deal for [Intel]”, he added.\nAlthough, analysts suggest that the deal might not help Intel, which is struggling to find external customers for its 14A and 18A manufacturing processes. Reuters spoke to experts, who said: “We don’t think any government investment will change the fate of its foundry arm if they cannot secure enough customers.\n“Intel must secure enough customers’ volume to go to production for its 18A and 14A nodes to make its foundry arm economically viable.”\nWhile the New York Times spoke to lawyers who said that the Chips Act may not allow the US government to convert grants into equity.\nAll this comes at a time when Intel has been trying desperately to restructure and recoup some of the ground it has lost to chip giants such as Nvidia, which have streaked ahead of Intel in recent years.\nIt recently halted plans for further fab builds in Europe, and announced thousands of layoffs, including at its Leixlip site.\nDon’t miss out on the knowledge you need to succeed.

      "text": "Trump Administration’s Stake in Intel: Strategic Move or a Slippery Slope to Socialism?\nA look at the U.S. taking 10% equity stake in Intel and why it should be regarded as a strategic investment rather than a foray into socialism.\nLate last week, it was announced that the Trump administration had reached an agreement for the federal government to acquire a roughly 10% stake in Intel, one of America’s leading chipmakers.\nThe deal involves the government investing $8.9 billion in Intel common stock, funded via grants under the CHIPS and Science Act (enacted in 2022 to address semiconductor chip shortages) and through other related federal programs.\nThe deal puts Trump on better terms with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, after the president recently said the CEO should step down due to conflicts of interest. It will ensure that the chipmaker will receive about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.\nUnder the agreement, the U.S. will purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, or $20.47 per share, which represents a discount of about $4 from Intel’s closing share price of $24.80 on Friday.\nThe purchase of the 433.3 million Intel shares will be made with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid grants from the Biden-era CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Secure Enclave program, also awarded under Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden.\nIntel stock rose roughly 1% in the extended session on Friday after closing up 5.5% during regular trading.\nThis is the latest special deal the Trump administration has made with American companies, under the “public-private” partnership template that the President favors (especially regarding the space industry). In April, the administration reached an agreement allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for receiving 15% of those sales. The Pentagon recently became the largest shareholder in a small mining company, MP Materials, to boost the output of rare earth magnets essential for our defense industry.\nI would argue that there are strong arguments in favor of the government’s move to back Intel through the procurement of common stock. To begin with, semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology and are vital for defense, infrastructure, and communications. By directly investing in Intel, the administration clearly plans to enhance and maintain a secure domestic chip supply and avoid strategic vulnerabilities related to foreign production.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clearly stressed that part of the rationale for taking a stake in the company is to reshore chip production.\n“We cannot rely on Taiwan, which is 9,500 miles away from us and only 80 miles from China,” he told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “So, you can’t have 99 percent of leading-edge chips made in Taiwan. We want to make them here.”\n“One of those pieces is it would be lovely to have Intel be capable of making a U.S. node or a U.S. transistor, driving that in America,” he added.\nThis type of deal is not the first of its kind, either. During the 2009 auto industry bailout, the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker.\nHowever, it must be noted that the government will not take a seat on Intel’s board or exercise governance rights. The agreement intends to provide a financial backstop rather than ongoing operational control. As a bonus, instead of just doling out money in the form of a grant, American taxpayers should see a return on investment if the company prospers.\nIt’s called “Return on Investment,” and it is a good thing.\nLots of criticism of the 10% stake in Intel. $INTC\nBut wait a second. All the Trump administration did was convert $9 billion in gifts, grants, and program funds into equity.\nThe equity stake is being funded through a conversion of existing federal support:\n•$5.7 billion in… pic.twitter.com/csEybgjAng— Allen Puwalski (@puwalski) August 23, 2025\nOn the other hand, many reasonable people are concerned that moves like this veer dangerously close to the kind of economic intervention associated with socialism. And many are justifiably concerned about a government being able to pick winners and losers.\nHowever, the fact of the matter is, American manufacturing has been gutted and hindered by awful policy choices. These destructive programs weren’t only from Obama or Biden, but Team Bush did Americans no great favors either.\nAnd a great deal of discretion needs to be given to industries that our vital to our national defense.\nFirst, it’s a complicated policy issue that is probably better in the hands of a more policy nuanced administration.\nBut somehow many decades of blind policy resulted in high 90s% of our chips being made in a territory that has an uncomfortable probability of coming under…\n— Allen Puwalski (@puwalski) August 23, 2025\nI would argue that the Trump administration’s stake in Intel is justified given the serious issues with the semiconductor supply chain and the need to preserve American technology leadership. However, this type of approach must be watched with great vigilance. It is good to see the absence of governance rights and a clearly delineated scope for intervention clearly spelled out in this deal, as a healthy and adaptive economy needs to avoid sliding down into a socialist slope.\nThe Intel strategy safeguards national interests in a critical sector without fully crossing into the pitfalls of socialism. But policymakers must remain vigilant and ensure these interventions remain exceptional, transparent, and subject to regular scrutiny.\nFinally, I am inclined to trust the Trump team on this matter, given all the other policy successes I have observed so far in the President’s second term.\nToday in “Would you idiots please stop trying to make me into a Trump supporter?”\nThe federal government just paid $8.9B to take a 10% stake in Intel . Various people are posturing about “socialism” and Trump “seizing the means of production”.\nThere’s a lot for me to disagree…\n— Eric S. Raymond (@esrtweet) August 23, 2025\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law.\nComments\nSocialism\nToo big to fail\nNot a god idea\nOverall the interventions can sound alarming but can be understood under Nat Defense concerns. Propping up GM was seen as a necessity for economic reasons I guess. Today chips have taken the place of crude oil as a Nat Sec commodity. I will stay mum on Nvidia since I own shares already. But what I have yet to understand is just what happened to Intel over the years as they seem dead in the water?\nThe administrative class flew engineering into the ground. The same as Boeing. The same thing is about to happen / has happened to medical care.\nPropping up GM included screwing bondholders who had first priority claim on assets of the company, compared to unions who were just general creditors. That was an outright taking from bondholders. Priority is the essence of the credit markets, and loans are priced to accommodate it.\n“Finally, I am inclined to trust the Trump team on this matter, given all the other policy successes I have observed so far in the President’s second term.”\nMe, too. But one day a pharoah who knows not Joseph will rise up, and that never ends well.\nMoreover, I’m curious how many congress critters purchased Intel stock last week before this deal was announced. I guess we’ll find out in 45 days when they are required to declare their buy/sell deals.\nI’m certain any purchases will all be just a coincidence…\nInsider trading is actually a positive for all concerned. The stock is mispriced and the inside traders move it to the correct price. So the unfortunate seller gets more for his stock that he would have otherwise because insiders are buying it.\nThat said, more money has been lost in inside information than any other cause.\nIntel had lost their way years ago. They stayed with the x86 architecture, which was power hungry and slow, even when smart phones were being first designed clearly requiring low power computing. Similar needs of power efficiency is required for embedded computing – think the internet of everything including cars so Intel is losing out in the smart phone and embedded market. .With the greater numbers of smart phone and declining sales for PCs, ARM and its licensors simply ate Intel’s lunch. Then when NVIDIA successfully pivoted their graphics driver chips to implement AI, Intel was again on the outs. TSMC with their open foundry model has leveraged the market for multiple system on a chip (SoC) designs to feed their factories and drive technological innovation again leaving Intel in the technological dust. As long as we have WinTel PCs, Intel has a business. Beyond that, it is debatable given the Intel track record in the past several decades of strategic planning. This deal is framed as the government getting equity for money already allocated to Intel. If that is indeed the case, this may well be making the best of a bad decision. But I’m afraid that in the future we will witness some Democratic-Socialist proposing nationalizing some industry and pointing to DJT’s Intel equity arrangement for justification.\nNew laptops don’t heat the house in the winter like an army of the 2005=2015 versions, say you’re working a massive parallel math problem once a year.\nDon’t like this trend.\nGovernment picking winners.\nSocialism.\nSpending money we dont have\nCrony capitalism\nNo seat on the board\nInsider trading (likely)\nAMD took heaps of money from the German government to stay afloat.\nIn the early 2000s, this and shorting their own stock (I’m serious) was the only cash they had in some quarters. They were literally selling covered calls and buying puts on their own stock going down!!! It was on their 10k/10q!!!!\nI’ve got a 20 year window of Intel. 10 on the inside and another 10 adjacent.\nIn the 90s they would take risks on innovation. The Intel Architecture Labs were inventing some really cool stuff. However Intel would never invest in it. They would never invest in anything outside of manufacturing. They would give away millions, to SW companies but never enter the pool themselves in spite of having some really decent tech.\nSo in 95-97, MSFT had some desktop products and an OS. Intel could have gotten into the console market, but chose not to. Boom- then XBOX became a thing.\nFew people know this but Intel actually made PCs and servers. They were every bit as good as what OEMs were selling, but they would never enter the market for fear of pissing off the OEMs (CHICKEN SHIT MOVE BY\nMANAGEMENT- like every other move).\nTheir first graphics card (i740) was so-s0, not a killer, but not bad. However they refused to invest. At this time 3DFX was buying up all the tech and hiring all the engineers … (my team lost one of the smartest guys I’ve ever met to them)- and I believe this was later bought up by NVDA. Intel backed out of the graphics gig and only later re-entered in the budget market. Total chicken shit move.\nBy 2000, Intel was steeped in NOT innovating and they were playing the game of keeping wall street happy by just being earnings estimates…. ALWAYS by cost cutting. Not only did this make Intel a worse company, it fast became a really shitty place to work.\nI was gone in 2006, but by 2017, they had gotten so damn cheap, they would literally track to the person how many freaking photo copies they made and nit pick them over the necessity.\nWhile hunting for my current gig- I did two informational interviews with them. One was with the supply chain team- and they were doing serious stuff that mattered and I could tell this team was serious. The other team was the team I mentioned earlier that put out the PCs, / Servers. These are the development systems they send out ahead of launch (and are just as good as OEM stuff)- however that team was being run by a blue haired woman who had been promoted her entire career for being female. She got really annoyed with me in the informational and was sort of c**t in saying the interview wouldn’t go any further. Never mind I knew the product and the team and the people started that team better than she did.\nThat brings me to my last point. Back in the 90s, a lot of women were hired there for their looks. Being flush with cash, a lot of managers hired eye candy. More than a little dating subordinates was happening and I’m surprised they didn’t get burned by this. Later as “women in IT” got to be a big thing, these ladies and some of the other worthless females at the company advanced when they ought not to have. Well this results in contributing to the Intel you have today.\nIt’s too bad, because I knew some of the architects and firmware guys and they were freaking smart.\nIntel was a chief customer for chip logic verification software (safety and liveness) in the 2000’s, so there had to be a lot of new designs.\nMicrosoft re-became the juggernaut it is today by re-inventing itself away from boxed SW. They became cloud SW providers. They bet the farm on it. They soon after became the OWNER of the cloud, as did AMZN. Hence you see both companies along with Apple, Google and a few others soar during these years.\nNot Intel. Just making chips. They could have freaking owned the entire cloud. They could have gotten big into the NW hardware and taken on Cisco. Nope.\nThey refused to innovate. They refused to re-invent themselves.\nThey wanted to be nothing more than a commodity supplier racing to win in a market of declining margins.\nMy 1998 employee stock options (at 75) which expired in 2012 but if they hadn’t it wouldn’t matter because they have been garbage since 2000. That’s piss poor company leadership.\nThe funny thing is- when I was an intern, Apple was about to go belly up and the stock was like 13 bucks/share going into the dot com bubble. We joked about how worthless they were as an investment compared to Intel. A year or so later, they come out with the ipod and they haven’t looked back.\nIf we were sitting in the early ’90s before our governing and financial class (with the enthusiastic support of many of the ‘conservative’ talking heads pearl clutching today) sold out domestic US manufacturing/industry to globalism (aka cheap foreign labor offshore production without the same pesky environmental/legal and labor condition constraints as they simultaneously burdened the domestic US market with) then we’d have a far different conversation.\nThere wouldn’t be a need to take such innovative steps to fix our domestic capacity b/c we’d have kept the capacity here along with good paying/good benefit jobs that used to comprise the middle-class. For that matter we might have avoided the clamor for Obama Care b/c those deliberately gutted manufacturing/industrial jobs came with good health benefits.\nWe gotta get back enough independence to manufacture all sorts of necessary things or put our economy at the mercy of other Nations. As highlighted during ‘Rona Mania the supply chain is fragile. We don’t make Aspirin in the USA anymore much less a host of other very necessary items for a modern 1st world Nation. This sucks that we gotta have the Federal Gov’t take ownership stakes in domestic US corporations to get the necessary capital to undo or at least mitigate the failed policies of globalism.\nIt would be nice if all the pearl clutching ‘conservative’ voices had been willing to do what was necessary over the past several decades to ‘conserve’ our domestic manufacturing and industrial base along with the good paying/good benefit jobs. Had they been willing to do so instead of selling out the middle-class to globalism so their stock prices went up a few extra % based on slave labor conditions in overseas production…. we wouldn’t need to take this step.\ndidn’t work for Hugo Chavez and won’t work now\nFWIW I didn’t claim it would or wouldn’t be successful. In fact lamented that it was made necessary to find new solutions by the malfeasance of the globalists/neocons and general indifference of the credentialed/leadership class to the entirely predictable decisions to eviscerate the American middle-class by off shoring the good paying/good benefit manufacturing/industrial production jobs.\nIf you have a feasible alternative then lets hear it.\nMy concern is that the government mismanages everything it touches. And intel has already been mismanaged. This is a recipe for billions of lost dollars.\nBad bad bad for several reasons\nNow the feds have an incentive to show favoritism over competitors\nIf it loses money, it gets subsidies from the taxpayers, no incentive to make a profit?\nPlus government should not own companies and should not fund NGO’s either\n1) Show me the constitutional authority.\n2) “But all we’re doing is replacing one unconstitutional money firehose with another!” Yup, that makes it all OK.\n3) Trump sets precedent with this, Democrats will be buying stock in Sancho Panza Wind Farms. You thought Solyndra was a scandal?\n3) Socialism? We’re tickling the f-word here. Either that or the reverse f-word, which means industry capture of government agencies.\nIn fairness in modern era Reagan set the precedent with Auto industry. ‘W’ Bush followed up with bank/financial bailout. His father as well with S&L crisis and establishing the Resolution Trust. Whether we call it a bailout or investment to assist domestic corporations the mechanics of US Taxpayer dollars going out the door to private corporations doesn’t change.\nIt would be far better to have a situation where this sort of govt injection of capital wasn’t necessary to get not just critical items but all sorts of things manufactured domestically so we didn’t have strategic vulnerabilities to supply interruptions we currently have.\nI don’t like this either but I am not seeing any short term alternatives.\nAs at least one commenter has already pointed out, there is a legacy of decision making–both within Intel and within the government–that made high-end chip-making a foreign activity. That is unfortunate, and the increasing level of risk that Taiwan will be seized by the Chinese Communist Party (while we observe the niceties that there is a country called China, that country ceased to exist in 1949; what really exists is a political party that has an army and occupies a large piece of land in Asia) is a threat to our ability to operate a modern economy. The only viable path to remedy this problem involves federal expenditures; the question is what “strings” are attached to those funds.\nHaving said that, the skeptics have a good point: the federal government is not a trustworthy entity, and the Democrats will have their opportunity soon enough to follow this path for their favored industry/industries. The only way to fix the problem is for the American people to watch the government closely and make their concerns known during election season (for the House, at least, it’s always election season since they face the voters every other year).\nWe forget at our peril that government of the people, by the people, for the people only works well if the people are heavily involved and aware of what their representatives think and do.\nIntel is going down as a chip designer, but it might be salvageable as a manufacturer.\nLeave a Comment"

      "text": "Transcript: Economist Mohamed El-Erian on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Aug. 24, 2025\nThe following is the transcript of an interview with Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. economy. Mohamed El-Erian is the Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon, but he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So why then did the financial markets rally?\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability, and the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side, and therefore an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system. Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth, and there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point, but it's a lot of uncertainty. Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if, basically, he's saying throw out your models?\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent, and therefore he has tended to be late. Look, there is something promising in our future, and that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in AI in life sciences and robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds, and that includes high debt and high deficits.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawe- Lawler just before you, and that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chip maker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.\n[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:\nHe walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.\n[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10% stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so, Margaret. Look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing, and that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what they are saying now--\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --Which were paid back--\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back, but at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas. The most important distinction, if I may, here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10% but it must not control how this company manages its affair, because once we go down that road that is a really dangerous road, and that would eat away at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the Commerce Secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for. I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve Chair, which you've nodded to, but the President is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her without publicly disclosed evidence of mortgage fraud and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell, encouraging her to be removed. Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So these allegations are unproven, and it's important to stress that. Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. And an independent central bank is critical to the well being of the economy, and there's lots of reasons for that. So you know, one has to disting- distinguish between the two. I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information, and is denying wrongdoing here. But just the fact that it is the President directing the attention towards her doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful, and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?\nMOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I- my fear and my concern is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

      "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Friday that the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in struggling Silicon Valley pioneer Intel in a deal that was completed only a couple of weeks after he called the company's CEO a \"conflicted\" leader and called for him to resign.\n\"The United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote in a post.\nThe U.S. government is getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges.\nAll told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece, a discount from Friday's closing price of $24.80. That spread means the U.S. government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper.\nThe remarkable turn of events has made the U.S. government one of Intel's largest shareholders at a time when the Santa Clara, California, company is in the process of laying off more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to recover from years of missteps under various CEOs.\nIntel's current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months and earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist.\nTrump latched onto those concerns in an Aug. 7 post, demanding that Tan resign.\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the U.S. government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023.\nTrump hailed Tan as a \"highly respected\" CEO in his Friday post.\nIn a statement, Tan applauded Trump for \"driving historic investments in a vital industry\" and resolved to reward his faith in Intel.\n\"We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,\" Tan said.\nIntel's current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60% below its peak reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later.\nThe company's market value currently stands at about $108 billion – a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion.\nThe stake is primarily coming through U.S. government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act, which was initiated under the former President Joe Biden's administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips and reduce dependence on overseas factories.\nHowever, the Trump administration, which had regularly criticized the policies of the Biden administration, viewed the CHIPS Act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to profit from the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n\"We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. \"It’s obvious that it’s the right move to make.\"\nApproximately $7.8 billion had been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded to date. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called \"Secure Enclave.\"\nAlthough the U.S. government can't vote with its shares and won't have a seat on Intel's board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could harm the tech industry in various ways.\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time when he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n\"Overall, it’s a horrendous move that will have real harms for U.S. companies, U.S. tech leadership, and the U.S. economy overall,\" Lincicome posted Friday.\nThe 10% stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel's stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating past business successes.\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago due to the numerous challenges facing the Company.\n\"I don’t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily, to the chip industry,\" Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel's business.\n\"I don’t care how good a businessperson you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government,\" Tengler said.\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008, when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in exchange for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker, at a time when it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ultimately incurred a loss of approximately $10 billion after selling its stock in GM.\nThe U.S. government's stake in Intel aligns with Trump's push to bring production back to the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war he has been waging globally. By reducing the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead over China in the race to develop artificial intelligence.\nEven before gaining the 10% stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses."

      "text": "“Is Intel too big to fail?”: Analysts question Trump’s $9 billion deal\nCritics warn government cash will not fix weak yields or lure customers to Intel’s foundry arm.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is injecting nearly $9 billion into Intel in exchange for a 9.9% equity stake. But analysts say the money, funding that the struggling chipmaker was already slated to receive under a federal program, will not be enough for its contract chipmaking business to thrive.\nWhat Intel needs are external customers for its advanced 14A manufacturing process, an unlikely prospect in the short term.\nCEO Lip Bu Tan, who took the top job in March, warned last month that the company may have to exit the contract chipmaking business if it fails to land major clients. “Going forward, our investment in Intel 14A will be based on confirmed customer commitments,” he said.\nKinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights, underscored the economic reality of Tan’s warning: “Intel must secure enough customer volume to go to production for its 18A and 14A nodes to make its foundry arm economically viable,” he said. “We don’t think any government investment will change the fate of its foundry arm if they cannot secure enough customers.”\nThe company, once synonymous with U.S. chipmaking dominance, has stumbled after years of mismanagement, ceding its manufacturing lead to Taiwan’s TSMC and losing ground in the race for artificial intelligence chips to Nvidia.\nNow, at an impasse, Intel must prove it can produce advanced chips to win customers. Reuters has reported that its 18A process, less advanced than 14A, is already struggling with yields, the measure of how many usable chips are produced.\nLarge foundries like TSMC absorb early yield losses when working with customers such as Apple. For Intel, which has posted net losses for six consecutive quarters, that’s harder to do while still maintaining profitability.\n“If the yield is bad then new customers won’t use Intel Foundry, so it really won’t fix the technical aspect of the company,” said Ryuta Makino, an analyst at Gabelli Funds, which holds Intel stock. Makino, who believes Intel will eventually achieve competitive yields, nonetheless called the deal a net negative compared with simply receiving the promised CHIPS Act funding under the Biden administration. “This isn’t free money,” he said.\nThe federal government will not take a seat on Intel’s board but has agreed to vote alongside the company on matters requiring shareholder approval, subject to limited exceptions. The government is acquiring its shares at a 17.5% discount to Friday’s closing price.\nThe stake makes Washington Intel’s largest shareholder, though neither Trump nor Intel disclosed the timing of the transaction. Intel shares closed up 5.5% Friday on the news but slipped 1% in after-hours trading once the deal’s terms were disclosed. They are up 23% this year as Tan has announced sweeping job cuts.\n‘Marginally Weaker Appetite’\nThe investment, the latest extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate America, aligns with Trump’s push to revive domestic manufacturing and create jobs. It follows his criticism earlier this month of Tan as “highly conflicted” over ties to Chinese firms, before later backing the CEO.\nSome analysts say Intel could benefit from Washington’s support, particularly in scaling up factories. Intel has pledged more than $100 billion to expand its U.S. plants and expects high-volume production at its Arizona site later this year.\n“To have access to capital and a new partial owner that wants to see you succeed are both important,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.\nIntel said the $8.9 billion investment is in addition to $2.2 billion in grants already awarded, bringing the total government commitment to $11.1 billion. Washington will also receive a five-year warrant, priced at $20 a share, for an additional 5% stake, exercisable if Intel no longer owns at least 51% of its foundry business.\n“On one hand, a government stake could be seen as a signal that Intel is ‘too big to fail.’ On the other, people worry about governance implications and whether the company can still act fully in shareholders’ interests,” said Andy Li, senior analyst at CreditSights. “The company is not receiving incremental government funding, which suggests a marginally weaker appetite from Washington to provide additional support.”\nThe deal comes days after a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.\n“This is a great deal for America and also a great deal for Intel. Building leading-edge semiconductors and chips, which is what Intel does, is fundamental to the future of our nation,” Trump said Friday."

      "text": "Corporate America has built up defenses against the likes of Carl Icahn, Nelson Peltz, and other corporate raiders who have rattled the cages of CEOs, pushing for higher stock prices. Now companies have a new investor to worry about: the president of the United States.\nPresident Trump has inserted the government into US companies in extraordinary ways, including taking a stake in U.S. Steel and pushing for a cut of Nvidia’s and Advanced Micro Devices’ revenue from China. Last month, the Pentagon said it was taking a 15 percent stake in MP Materials, a large American miner of rare earths.\nAnd Friday, Intel agreed to allow the US government to take a 10 percent stake in its business, worth $8.9 billion.\nThese developments could herald a shift from America’s vaunted free-market system to one that resembles, at least in some corners, a form of state-managed capitalism more frequently seen in Europe and, to a different degree, China and Russia, say lawyers, bankers, and academics steeped in the history of hostile takeovers and international business.\nAnd the actions are sending Wall Street’s bankers and lawyers scrambling to help companies come up with a playbook to defend against or least find ways to mollify Trump.\nAdvertisement\n“Virtually every company I’ve talked to which is a regular recipient of subsidies or grants from the government is concerned about this right now,” Kai Liekefett, co-chair of the corporate defense practice at the law firm Sidley Austin, said in an interview.\nThe Trump administration is casting a wide net, scouring other companies that it thinks could be ripe for some form of government involvement, three people briefed on these discussions said.\nAdvertisement\nThe US government has inserted itself in corporate America before. The Obama administration took stakes in banks and auto companies after the 2008 financial crisis, and both the Obama and Biden administrations used government subsidies to promote green technology.\nBut experts say Trump’s push is different from -- and more aggressive than -- what the United States had seen before. The companies he is targeting are not on the cusp of collapse; nor would their demise, as in the case of the banks during the financial crisis, set off a chain of events that could lead to global economic ruin.\n“America has always been wary about the line between public and private enterprise,” said Jonathan Levy, a historian and professor at Sciences Po in Paris and author of “Ages of American Capitalism: A History of the United States.”\n“The one time it’s been suspended,” he added, “is in the context of war or national security interest.”\nThe White House insists that national security is indeed driving its investments and disputed the notion that taking these stakes in critically important companies is undermining free markets.\nIntel was awarded a roughly $11 billion grant as part of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law passed during the Biden administration aimed at making the United States less reliant on Asia for semiconductor manufacturing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has argued that by taking an equity stake, US taxpayers will get the upside of any boost afforded to Intel.\n“This is not a pots-and-pans company,” a White House official said. “This amounts to something so critical to national security that it warrants this action.”\nAdvertisement\nBut some of Trump’s recent moves appear to be a strong break with historical precedent. In the cases of Nvidia and AMD, the Trump administration has proposed dictating the global market that these chipmakers can have access to. The two companies have promised to give 15 percent of their revenue from China to the US government in order to have the right to sell chips in that country and bypass any future US restrictions.\nDavid Sicilia, an associate professor of history emeritus at the University of Maryland, said he had never seen a time when the United States had changed its trade policy to target one or more specific companies.\n“The least generous interpretation is that it’s extortion for success,” he said.\nWhen discussing the Intel deal Friday, Trump said the company’s CEO had “walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States.”\nActivist investors like Icahn and Peltz typically take stakes in companies struggling in the public market and then push them to make changes that will lift their share price, like selling off a division or replacing a CEO. But unlike a traditional corporate activist, Trump has not always clearly tied his calls for corporate action -- whether it be ousting a chief executive or “eating the cost of tariffs” -- to a company’s returns.\nFor now, Intel shareholders have reacted favorably to the government’s deepening involvement. Shares of Intel closed up more than 5 percent Friday as Trump announced that the government was taking the stake. Shares of competitors like AMD have fallen since news of the potential deal became public last week, a decline that analysts partly attribute to the expectation that the government will support Intel over other chip companies.\nAdvertisement\n“If you are focused on the short term, then these sorts of deals may be beneficial, because you’re going to get squeezed anyway,” said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a political scientist and an associate professor of international studies at the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies at Indiana University.\nBut, she cautioned, “once the government gets involved in strategic decision-making, those strategic choices are no longer driven by market considerations.”\nThe current playbook for companies to avoid the threat of a government stake or other extraordinary demands, corporate advisers say, is to continue what they are already doing to stay out of Trump’s crosshairs: scrubbing public websites of diversity, equity, and inclusion language and making more visits to the president in Washington. (Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, for example, has visited Trump four times since he took office in January, according to two people with knowledge of the visits. That is an unusually high number for the bank’s CEO.)\nPolicy experts say they worry that this type of business climate is eroding the level playing field that they believe is crucial to the country’s long-term success.\n“Who will want to invest in companies the administration is not backing?” Dan Ikenson, an economist and a trade expert, asked. “What will happen to promising firms that don’t kiss Trump’s ring?\"\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

We covered the crypto companies that pushed that surge earlier today.\n“What you’re seeing is the recognition that growth at Nvidia is rock solid,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told Bloomberg. “Analysts are raising projections because they simply need to, the stock is not going to slow down.”\nHow did Nvidia get here?\nIt’s been quite a year for Nvidia.\nThe stock has been caught in the Trump administration’s tariff wars and fell sharply in April. It has since clawed back about three-quarters of those losses.\nBut that dip followed a chilly beginning to 2025, as it became clear that even Nvidia would have tough competition from compatriot company DeepSeek, which rolled out a discount AI model that astonished the market.\nRecently, the stock wobbled this week as the broader AI market felt the effects of being dubbed a “bubble” by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nMore immediately, Nvidia has signaled it is willing to play ball with Trump’s aggressive attempts to take stakes in major tech companies like Apple and AMD.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is in talks with the American government to produce a new computer chip, a move that coincides with a joint announcement that the U.S. will take a 10% ownership slice of Intel.\n“I’m offering a new product to China for … AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,” Huang said. But he added that “That’s not our decision to make. It’s up to, of course, the United States government. And we’re in dialogue with them, but it’s too soon to know.”\nIn the wake of Altman’s comments, however, Nvidia’s share price fell to $174 from $182 in 48 hours, as proponents of the AI bubble theory came out in force.\nHuge expectations for a huge achiever\nStill, no matter how much external pressure Nvidia feels from competitors and a rapidly evolving landscape of technology, it still remains the dominant player because of its sheer size and faster moves out of the starting blocks with its AI.\nIt also has far more reach and potentially a wider variety of clients for its more diversified set of products.\n“[Nvidia] commentary on the demand side… should be more bullish just because their largest customers have all kind of upped their capex guidance over the last few quarters,” Roach told Reuters.\nIn fact, it is so big and has grown at such a scorching pace that if its quarterly revenue is up less than 70% year over year when it reports Wednesday, the company would likely see its share price fall.\nA growth in revenue at that rate would be a major coup for most other companies, 24/7 Wall Street points out—for Nvidia, however, it would alarm investors who are spooked by the idea that it may eventually even slow down."

      "text": "With the government buying stocks in private companies, such as the US government’s newly-announced purchase of ten percent of technology giant Intel, it’s important to know why this is fascist and not communist.\nThere is a difference between the two.\nWith communism, government owns all of the capital outright. There is no private ownership of business or industry. Communism always collapses very quickly because there are no market prices.\nWith government being the only owner of capital, you can’t have a market. It takes (at least) two property owners to tango and to generate market prices. Without market prices, you can’t have profits and losses. So the government has no idea what they are doing. They don’t know where to add resources, and where to take them away.\nNo market signals.\nPoverty and starvation comes quickly with communism.\n“The powers that shouldn’t be” use communism more as a weapon to destroy a targeted society, than as an actual economic system. Communism is a tool to destroy…and then it’s replaced with something that has at least a hint of rationality to it.\nFascism is usually the go-to for “the powers that shouldn’t be” because there’s a hint of rationality that keeps it from dying quickly. With fascism, government and corporations are “separate,” but act as one. As opposed to communism, government isn’t the sole owner of capital.\nMarkets still exist … profits and losses exist … But the whole process is warped and retarded.\nBIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies.\n— Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) August 22, 2025\nThis historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge.\nThanks to Intel… pic.twitter.com/AYMuX14Rgi\nCorporations tied to government are kept in business when they should go bankrupt. Resources that should be freed to do more productive things, are instead kept in losing ventures.\nWith fascism, THE BIG decisions and investments are made, not for the consumers, but for the power of the government. The corporations are arms of the state.\nGovernment won’t censor you, the corporation will, on behalf of the government. Government won’t counterfeit money; the private bank will, on behalf of the government.\nTech isn’t made for us (even though we enjoy many benefits). It’s made for the government to surveil and try to control us.\nSince fascism consists of markets for the benefit of state power, the markets ultimately become so warped and resources are so misallocated, that fascism collapses too.\nWith communism, the economy bleeds out without anything to coagulate it. Nothing stops the bleeding. There is no market. With fascism, the economy bleeds, but slower, since there are remnants of the market. But both end in economic death.\nFascism is what strangles the world today.\nIn America it’s as obvious as anything. We continually watch our standard of living bleed away. But it bleeds much slower than if it was communist. It has taken generations.\nThe United States is called “capitalist,” but it is fascist.\nChina is called “communist” but it is fascist.\nBoth are state + corporations operating with market prices; with profits and losses. Fascism ends very badly. It is known as a “vampire economy.” The economy bleeds to death slowly. We’ve gone very far from the original “land of the free.”"

Instead, it’s simply making good on what Intel described as “grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel.”\nSpecifically, the $8.9 billion is supposed to come from $5.7 billion awarded-but-not-paid to Intel under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, as well as $3.2 billion also awarded by the Biden administration through the Secure Enclave program.\nIn a post on his social network Truth Social, Trump wrote, “The United States paid nothing for these shares.” Nonetheless, he described this as “a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.”\nTrump has been critical of the CHIPS Act, calling it a “horrible, horrible thing” and calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to “get rid” of it. In a regulatory filing in June, Intel said that while it had already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, it had subsequently requested an additional $850 million in reimbursement that the government had not yet paid.\nAccording to The New York Times, some bankers and lawyers believe the CHIPS Act may not allow the government to convert its grants to equity, opening this deal to potential legal challenges.\nIn addition to his targeting of the CHIPS Act, earlier this month Trump also accused Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan of conflicts of interests and said he should “resign immediately.” The president was more positive about Tan on Friday, saying on Truth Social that he “negotiated this deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.”\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "Back in 1935, the drafters of Social Security told Congress of their plans to build up a government pension reserve that would reach $47 billion.\nThe number shocked lawmakers. It was nearly three times the outstanding federal debt of the time.\n“What in heaven’s name are you going to do with $47 billion?” Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, Republican of Michigan, asked Arthur Altmeyer, one of the drafters.\n“You could invest it in U.S. Steel and some of the large corporations,” Altmeyer suggested.\nVandenberg threw up his hands in horror. “That would be socialism!” he exclaimed.\nYet the idea of federal government investments in public corporation stock has never died. It walks among us like a zombie today, with the Trump administration talking about taking a 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker Intel and musing about creating a sovereign wealth fund akin to those established by Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Norway and other countries.\nHere’s what history tells us about the virtues of this idea for the United States: There aren’t any.\nSuch funds “usually reflect the quality of governance of the states that sponsor them,” observed Steven Feldstein and Jodi Vittori of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April. “Considering the Trump administration’s self-dealing and erosion of accountability, there is an acute risk that the U.S. SWF could become a source of graft to reward Trump’s friends, coerce political support for his priorities and bring personal enrichment.”\nLeaving aside the quality of governance in Trump’s White House or legislators’ fears of “socialism,” the idea of federal investment in public companies has never found lasting favor on Capitol Hill, for it has been almost impossible for lawmakers to overcome the touchy economic, political and philosophical issues.\nA federal fund with the authority to purchase corporate stock would be one of the largest and most potent investors in the market. As I wrote in 2005, when the idea of allowing Social Security to invest its trust fund in equities was under consideration again, the potential for conflicts of interest is inescapable.\nThe government might be a major shareholder in a corporation it was prosecuting for criminal activity. The government might end up on one side of an international issue as a member of a coalition of nations, and on the opposite side as a shareholder.\nIts financial interests might stand in opposition to its social interests: In his 1999 State of the Union message, for example, President Clinton simultaneously threatened to sue the tobacco industry over its threat to public health, and advocated allowing Social Security to invest in all equities — tobacco included.\nIn 1935, Congress addressed the conundrum by mandating that the Social Security Administration invest its reserves only in U.S. Treasury securities, a rule that exists to this day.\nSocial Security’s would-be reformers periodically revive proposals to shift some of the program’s trust fund — which held more than $2.7 trillion in treasuries at the end of last year — into equities, pointing to their superior long-term returns compared with bonds. But those efforts have never come to fruition.\nThe federal government taking an equity stake in a public company wouldn’t be unprecedented. In 2009, the Obama administration acquired a 60.8% ownership of General Motors in return for almost $50 billion in bailout funds. The government also acquired a smaller stake in Chrysler, which was subsequently sold to Fiat.\nThe government sold the last of its GM holdings in 2013, booking a direct loss of about $10.5 billion. But its bailout has been deemed a success, given that it saved as many as 1.9 million jobs at GM, Chrysler and their suppliers.\nThe auto bailouts were emergency initiatives, taken to stave off what was shaping up as the auto industry’s imminent collapse. Obama made clear that these were temporary measures and that the government would sell off its stockholdings as soon as that was practicable. The government abjured any control over GM’s day-to-day operations, but it did orchestrate the exit of GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, oversaw the replacement of a majority of its board members and imposed compensation limits on its top executives.\nThe auto bailouts followed numerous examples of U.S. government takeovers, or attempted takeovers, of private businesses. In 1791, Congress authorized the government to take a 20% stake in the Bank of the United States, and in 1816, to take the same stake in the Second Bank of the United States. These are seen today as precursors to the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank as a central banking authority.\nDuring the Great Depression, the Reconstruction Finance Corp., a Hoover creation that lived well into Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, took preferred shares in numerous impaired banks in return for capital infusions they needed to survive.\nBy the end of 1935, RFC-owned preferred stock amounted to nearly 40% of total bank common stock in the United States; the RFC’s hard-charging chairman, Texan Jesse Jones, was not shy about imposing “reasonable” compensation caps on its executives or replacing them when they faltered, or prodding their managements to make loans to private borrowers, a key element of FDR’s program of economic recovery.\nThe government also exercises effective control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored mortgage companies, via a conservatorship implemented in 2008, when the housing crash heralded the outset of the Great Recession. Stock in both companies remains in private hands, but warrants allow the government to acquire up to 79.9% of the common stock of each. Those warrants haven’t been exercised, but they equate to firm government authority over the firms’ activities.\nTrump’s proposed Intel investment would occur in a very different economic environment and have very different features from any of those precursors. The terms of the plan have been murky.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed during an appearance on CNBC Tuesday that the government would demand Intel shares in return for the roughly $10 billion in funds allocated to Intel via the Biden-era CHIPS Act, which aimed to shore up America’s position in high-tech hardware.\n“We’ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration,” Lutnick said. “We’ll get equity in return for it.” He quoted Trump as saying, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.”\nA $10-billion stake would be about 10% of Intel’s shares. That would make the government the company’s largest shareholder, outstripping the stakes held by institutional investors Vanguard and BlackRock. Lutnick said the government wouldn’t exercise voting rights or involve itself in governance. But he didn’t talk about a time-limited ownership, or specify what corporate policies the Trump administration would favor. As it happens, Trump has publicly demanded the resignation Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, a Malaysian, over Tan’s ostensible connections to China.\nDespite its stumbles in recent years, Intel doesn’t appear to be facing extinction, as the automakers arguably did in 2008 and 2009. Nor would Intel’s demise have anywhere near the impact on the U.S. economy that a GM collapse might have had amid the Great Recession.\nOnce the linchpin of the high-tech boom of the 1990s, Intel has plainly lost its mojo. As my colleague Queenie Wong reported, its strategic blunders have included missing out on the artificial intelligence investment boom that has made Nvidia, the maker of chips for AI development, a darling of today’s stock market.\nIntel hasn’t commented on the White House’s interest in taking an equity stake, but Intel investors don’t appear to know what to make of the idea. Shares in the company gained about 7% on Aug. 19, after Bloomberg first reported on the possibility, but have since fallen back, despite news that the Japanese investment firm SoftBank would take a $2-billion stake in the company.\nIntel shares fell 7% Wednesday in Nasdaq trading, closing at $23.54, a hair below their price prior to the Bloomberg report.\nWhether Trump could resist jawboning Intel, or any other companies in which the government holds shares, into instituting policies he favors is doubtful. He has frequently tried to exert pressure on CEOs of companies in which the government has no ownership, after all.\nThat concern would be heightened if the administration has control over a sovereign wealth fund. Trump aired that proposal via an executive order in February. The order called on Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to submit a plan by the beginning of May, but none has yet surfaced.\nA U.S. sovereign wealth fund wouldn’t be based on the same principles as those of many other such ventures. “SWFs have traditionally been set up by states rich in natural resources to manage their budgetary surplus, diversify their economies, and protect their wealth for future generations,” observed the Carnegie Endowment’s Feldstein and Vittori. That’s the case with the funds of both Saudi Arabia and Norway. The U.S., however, “doesn’t have excess funds to put into a SWF,” Feldstein and Vittori write.\nIn a fact sheet accompanying the executive order, Trump mentioned $5.7 trillion in government assets, including “natural resource reserves.” He has also talked about profits from crypto investments and the government take from tariffs — though the latter are essentially a tax on American consumers, who might have different ideas about how to spend the money.\nThe Carnegie researchers note that the most successful sovereign wealth funds such as Norway’s “maintain operational independence and make investments based on rigorous financial criteria.” Neither quality is a hallmark of the Trump administration.\nFeldstein and Vittori point out that by building a U.S. fund via tariff income or income from Trump’s “gold card” proposal, which would give rich foreigners the right to live in the U.S. for a $5-million fee, might allow Trump to evade Congress’s constitutional monopoly on raising and spending money and even allow him to manage the fund behind closed doors.\nStill, it would be up to Congress to establish the fund and oversee its operations. Will the lawmakers accept their responsibility? If not, Trump’s idea is a dangerous one. “Giving a president who aspires to be a king a potent financial weapon with ill-defined purposes and methods,” Feldstein and Vittori write, “presents a grave risk to American democracy.”\nMichael Hiltzik is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times."

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Friday announced the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in struggling Silicon Valley pioneer Intel in a deal that was completed just a couple weeks after he was depicting the company’s CEO as a conflicted leader unfit for the job.\n“The United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote in a post.\nThe U.S. government is getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges. All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — a discount from Friday’s closing price at $24.80. That spread means the U.S. government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper.\nThe remarkable turn of events makes the U.S. government one of Intel’s largest shareholders at a time that the Santa Clara, California, company is in the process of jettisoning more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to bounce back from years of missteps taken under a variety of CEOs.\nIntel’s current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months, an d earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist. Trump latched on to those concerns in an August 7 post demanding that Tan resign.\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the U.S. government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023. Trump hailed Tan as “highly respected” CEO in his Friday post.\nIn a statement, Tan applauded Trump for “driving historic investments in a vital industry” and resolved to reward his faith in Intel. “We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” Tan said.\nIntel’s current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60% below its peak of about $75 reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later. The company’s market value currently stands at about $108 billion – a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion.\nThe stake is coming primarily through U.S. government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act that was started under President Joe Biden’s administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips to lessen the dependence on overseas factories.\nBut the Trump administration, which has regularly pilloried the policies of the Biden administration, saw the CHIPs act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to make a profit off the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n“We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. “It’s obvious that it’s the right move to make.”\nAbout $7.8 billion had been been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded so far. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called “Secure Enclave.”\nAlthough U.S. government can’t vote with its shares and won’t have a seat on Intel’s board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could hurt the tech industry in a variety of ways.\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time that he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n“Overall, it’s a horrendous move that will have real harms for U.S. companies, U.S. tech leadership, and the U.S. economy overall,” Lincicome posted Friday.\nThe 10% stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel’s stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating his past successes in business.\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago because of all the challenges facing Intel.\n“I don’t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,” Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel’s business.\n“I don’t care how good of businessman you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government.,” Tengler said.\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nThe U.S. government’s stake in Intel coincides with Trump’s push to bring production to the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nEven before gaining the 10% stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\n—-\nLiedtke reported from San Ramon, California."

The government will not take a board seat or have other governance rights at Intel.\n“We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” Tan said in a statement.\nIn a social media post, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called the agreement “historic” and said it would strengthen U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which act as the brains of computers and are used in everything from toasters to cars and weapons. He included a photograph of himself beside Tan, whom he thanked “for striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.”\nThe deal is perhaps the most notable government intervention in a U.S. company since 2008, when the government poured tens of billions into Chrysler and General Motors to prevent their collapse. The agreement was also the Trump administration’s latest effort to put its own stamp on the CHIPS Act, while trying to reinvigorate Intel. Trump and other officials have derided the CHIPS Act for handing out money without getting anything in return.\nLutnick said on CNBC this week that Trump had decided to “turn the money that Biden was going to just give away” into “equity for the American people.” He added, “Donald Trump is fixing what Biden got completely, totally and utterly wrong.”\nShares of Intel rose more than 6% on news of the U.S. deal. Founded in 1968, the company was an industry pioneer that produced faster and increasingly powerful chips over the years, turning Silicon Valley into the bedrock of the U.S. tech sector. But Intel has been on the ropes after it missed several waves of innovation, including the smartphone and artificial intelligence revolutions. Other chipmakers, such as Nvidia, have ascended instead.\nThe deal with the Trump administration came together quickly. Trump had called for Tan’s resignation in a social media post this month, citing the executive’s ownership stakes in Chinese companies. Days later, Tan met with Trump at the White House and discussed giving the U.S. government an equity stake in the chipmaker.\nOn Wednesday, Lutnick and David Zinsner, Intel’s finance chief, reached the framework for an agreement, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. Later that day, Intel’s board blessed the deal, these people said. Lutnick and Tan settled the terms Thursday, a person familiar with the meetings said.\nTan “walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States,” Trump said.\nThe deal could face a challenge from shareholders or others concerned about its legality. The CHIPS Act may not allow the U.S. government to convert grants into equity, lawyers and bankers who have studied the law said.\nThe Trump administration has taken an interventionist approach with private companies, but especially with the semiconductor industry. In recent months, the president has threatened to take away government grants from chip companies, restricted billions of dollars in sales of AI chips to China before changing his mind, proposed high tariffs on chips made outside the United States and demanded investments in new U.S. factories.\nTrump has particularly targeted the CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. It created $50 billion in funding to rebuild the U.S. semiconductor industry.\nOver the past 50 years, production of chips has shifted to Asia, with many being produced in Taiwan, a self-governing island that faces the threat of a Chinese takeover.\nIn March, Trump said he wanted to “get rid of the CHIP Act.” Since then, his administration has pressured chipmakers to increase their U.S. investments to receive some $36 billion in grants promised by the Biden administration.\nIntel was awarded $10.86 billion in such funding: $3 billion to produce chips for the Defense Department and $7.86 billion for projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon.\nThe Biden administration had debated how heavily to subsidize Intel, seeing it as an important American company but a troubled one.\nShortly after the company received approval of its $7.86 billion federal grant, it fired its CEO, Pat Gelsinger.\nIn March, Intel hired Tan, a well-regarded semiconductor investor and manager, to fix the business. He outlined a plan to cut staff, develop a new AI strategy and focus on finding customers for a future iteration of Intel’s chipmaking technology.\nAt the same time that Trump pressured Tan to resign, the administration was withholding some of Intel’s federal grants, according to the company’s financial filings. Intel, which had received $2.2 billion of the money it was awarded, said in a filing in June that it had submitted a request for an additional $850 million in reimbursements that it had not received.\nA White House official said Intel’s prospects warranted federal government involvement given the importance of semiconductors to the economy. The official said the government was exploring other actions it could take to shore up Intel’s position, but declined to specify.\nHaving the government be an investor in Intel could add to the perception that the company is too big to fail. It is also likely to raise questions about whether Trump and other U.S. officials could ultimately play a role in pressuring other companies to become Intel customers.\nA government stake may not solve Intel’s problems. The company has struggled to compete in producing the latest chips. Even if the Trump administration leans on companies like Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm to buy from Intel, it remains to be seen if Intel can make the products that tech companies demand.\n“Once the government becomes a stakeholder, the question is: What will they do to protect their investments?” said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. “You don’t want to force companies to choose Intel. You want them to willingly choose to use Intel, but you may need to create incentives like tax breaks.”\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n© 2025 The New York Times Company"

In recent months, the president has threatened to take away government grants from chip companies, restricted billions of dollars in sales of AI chips to China before changing his mind, proposed high tariffs on chips made outside the United States and demanded investments in new U.S. factories.\nTrump has particularly targeted the CHIPS Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022. It created $50 billion in funding to rebuild the U.S. semiconductor industry. Over the past 50 years, production of chips has shifted to Asia, with many being produced in Taiwan, a self-governing island that faces the threat of a Chinese takeover.\nIn March, Trump said he wanted to “get rid of the CHIP Act.” Since then, his administration has pressured chipmakers to increase their U.S. investments to receive some $36 billion in grants promised by the Biden administration.\nIntel was awarded $10.86 billion in such funding: $3 billion to produce chips for the Defense Department and $7.86 billion for projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon.\nThe Biden administration had debated how heavily to subsidize Intel, seeing it as an important American company but a troubled one. Shortly after the company received approval of its $7.86 billion federal grant, it fired its CEO, Pat Gelsinger.\nIn March, Intel hired Tan, a well-regarded semiconductor investor and manager, to fix the business. He outlined a plan to cut staff, develop a new AI strategy and focus on finding customers for a future iteration of Intel’s chipmaking technology.\nAt the same time that Trump pressured Tan to resign, the administration was withholding some of Intel’s federal grants, according to the company’s financial filings. Intel, which had received $2.2 billion of the money it was awarded, said in a filing in June that it had submitted a request for an additional $850 million in reimbursements that it had not received.\nA White House official said Intel’s prospects warranted federal government involvement given the importance of semiconductors to the economy. The official said the government was exploring other actions it could take to shore up Intel’s position, but declined to specify.\nHaving the government be an investor in Intel could add to the perception that the company is too big to fail. It is also likely to raise questions about whether Trump and other U.S. officials could ultimately play a role in pressuring other companies to become Intel customers.\nA government stake may not solve Intel’s problems. The company has struggled to compete in producing the latest chips. Even if the Trump administration leans on companies like Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm to buy from Intel, it remains to be seen if Intel can make the products that tech companies demand.\n“Once the government becomes a stakeholder, the question is: What will they do to protect their investments?” said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. “You don’t want to force companies to choose Intel. You want them to willingly choose to use Intel, but you may need to create incentives like tax breaks.”\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n© 2025 The New York Times Company"

I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company,” wrote Trump on Truth Social. “The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\nThe reaction from the Right was largely negative.\n“MAGA thinks that the government forceably taking a stake in a private company is a good thing? Its a precedent that Democrats will use, and I guarantee you, will make America LESS competitive in the long run,” declared National Review contributor Pradheep Shanker. “Its a huge mistake. Frankly, I’d rather Intel goes bankrupt.”\n“Preposterous move. If Obama had done this, so many of the people defending it would have correctly condemned it as overreach and interference and ‘picking winners and losers,'” concurred National Review senior editor Charles C.W. Cooke.\n“Surely if former President Joe Biden had ‘invested’ in a major energy concern under the power of, say, a climate emergency, Republicans would have melted down over ‘socialism,'” observed The Washington Examiner‘s David Harsanyi in a column.\nSenator Rand Paul (R-KY) preempted Trump’s announcement by tweeting “If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism? Terrible idea.”\nAs did conservative radio host Erick Erickson, who called it “socialism with an R next to its name.”\nAs did National Review itself in an editorial headlined “The Government Shouldn’t Get Into the Chip Business.”\n‘How about just cancel the Intel subsidies instead of government owning a stake in a private business, and unfairly competing against other businesses?” asked former House Freedom Caucus member Bob Good.\nhttps://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/\n“Trump’s acquisition of stake in Intel highlights dangerous similarities between right-wing nationalist and left-wing socialist economic policies,” wrote Ilya Somin for Reason.\nBut wait, there’s more:\n— —"

      "text": "US secures 10% ownership in Intel as Trump prods new industrial policy\nThe US will take a 10% equity stake in Intel under a Trump-backed deal converting CHIPS Act grants into ownership.\nUS President Donald Trump announced that the United States government will acquire a 10% equity stake in Intel, one of the world's most important chipmakers, marking one of the boldest interventions in corporate US in recent history.\nThe deal converts nearly $10 billion in government grants, initially given under the CHIPS Act, a federal program aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor production, into partial ownership of the company.\nThe government will purchase about 433 million shares of Intel at $20.47 each, below the market price, for a total of $8.9 billion. The stake comes with an option to buy an additional 5% in the future if Intel’s chip manufacturing arm, known as its foundry business, loses independence.\nOnce a global leader in semiconductor production, Intel has faced deep financial troubles. In 2024, the company reported an $18.8 billion annual loss, its worst performance since the 1980s.\nIntel’s foundry business, its attempt to manufacture chips for outside clients, has become a money-losing division, with billions in quarterly losses. Despite heavy investment, Intel has struggled to secure major customers, falling far behind rivals like Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung.\nBeyond finances, Intel has also missed key technological shifts. The company largely sat out the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, leaving Nvidia to dominate that market, while also losing ground in its traditional markets to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\nThe role of the CHIPS Act\nThe CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in 2022, was designed to strengthen the US' position in semiconductor production. At the time, the US produced only about 10% of the world’s chips, compared to nearly 40% in 1990. Meanwhile, about three-quarters of global chip manufacturing is concentrated in East Asia, raising concerns that the US economy and military could become vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.\nThe act provided $52.7 billion in incentives to semiconductor companies, of which Intel became the largest beneficiary, receiving nearly $11 billion in funding. However, the Trump administration’s decision to turn these grants into government ownership represents a fundamental shift in policy, ensuring that taxpayers directly contribute to Intel’s potential recovery.\nSemiconductors are essential components in nearly every modern technology, from smartphones and laptops to fighter jets, satellites, and missile systems.\nUS officials argue that relying on foreign suppliers for advanced chips poses a national security risk, and Trump framed the Intel deal as part of a larger strategy to guarantee that the US can produce its own advanced microchips at home.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described the arrangement as “fair to Intel and fair to the American people,” stressing that the government’s stake is designed to be passive, without a seat on Intel’s board.\nIntel’s downsizing in \"Israel\"\nIntel’s struggles are not limited to the US. The company is undergoing its largest downsizing in more than a decade in \"Israel,\" where its workforce has fallen from 12,000 in 2021 to below 9,000 in mid-2025. For the first time, job cuts have reached its flagship plant in Kiryat Gat, which produces chips using older technologies that are no longer competitive globally.\nIntel has also suspended its massive $25 billion Fab 38 expansion project in the city, a move described by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as one of its biggest victories. These changes reflect Intel’s broader technological lag and financial strain, which have forced the company to cut costs globally.\nThe company’s leadership has also undergone major changes. Former CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced out in late 2024 after investors lost confidence in his strategy. He was replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March 2025. Tan has focused on cost-cutting and securing external customers, moving away from the massive factory expansion plan pursued by his predecessor."

      "text": "For decades, American politicians have looked across the Atlantic at Europe’s experiments with state-directed industry with a mixture of pity and scorn. The French model of dirigisme, with its state-owned champions and politically guided investments, was often held up as a cautionary tale of bureaucratic meddling and economic sclerosis.\nYet, in a move that turns decades of free-market economics on its head, the United States government is now a leading shareholder in one of Silicon Valley’s founding giants. The agreement for Washington to take a nearly 10% stake in Intel is more than just a bailout for a struggling chipmaker; it is a striking symbol of a new era in American economic policy, one that bears an uncomfortable resemblance to the European state capitalism of the 1960s.\nThe deal itself, announced by President Donald Trump, is an extraordinary piece of political theatre and financial engineering. The 10% stake in Intel will not be funded bynew money, but through a clever conversion of funds already allocated to the chipmaker through the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which was designed to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing.\nThe current arrangement with Intel was born of a hurried rapprochement between the president and Intel’s chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan. Mr. Trump had previously called for Mr. Tan’s resignation over his prior investments in Chinese start-ups. After a meeting, however, the president’s tone changed dramatically.\nIt is a transactional, almost improvisational, approach to industrial strategy that has become a hallmark of the administration.\n“I said, I think you should pay us 10% of your company. And they said ‘yes’ — that is about $10 billion,” Mr. Trump told about his interaction with Intel during an Oval Office press briefing on Friday.\n“He walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the U.S.,” Mr. Trump said.\nThis is not Mr. Trump’s isolated venture. The White House has struck other unusual deals, including allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI processors to China on the condition that Washington receives a portion of the revenue. The Intel deal, however, marks the most significant direct equity stake in a major technology firm, prompting Mr. Trump to declare, “We do a lot of deals like that: I’ll do more of them.”\nThe parallel with 1960s Europe is compelling. Back then, governments in countries like France and Britain, alarmed by what was dubbed the “technology gap” with America, poured public money into creating “national champions” in strategic sectors such as computers and aerospace. The belief was that only the state had the deep pockets and long-term vision to build companies that could compete on a global scale. These policies, however, were largely unsuccessful, often resulting in uncompetitive, state-coddled firms that drained taxpayer funds and lagged in innovation.\nIntel, once the undisputed king of semiconductors, now finds itself in a position that makes it a candidate for such state intervention. The company has been haemorrhaging money, posting a staggering operating loss in 2024, and has fallen technologically behind rivals like Taiwan’s TSMC. Its struggles to attract external customers for its manufacturing arm and delays in construction plans in states like Ohio have cast doubt on its turnaround strategy. This weakness made Intel uniquely receptive to Washington’s offer. Foreign competitors like TSMC and Samsung, which are also building factories in America with CHIPS Act subsidies, are far too successful and valuable to entertain ceding a significant equity stake to Uncle Sam.\nSo, this is not a case of the government picking a winner, but of preventing a national icon — and a critical node in the domestic semiconductor supply chain — from falling further into irrelevance.\nHowever, there is a crucial distinction between this new American interventionism and its European precursor. The government’s investment is structured as a passive, non-voting ownership stake. Washington will have no seat on the board and no formal governance rights, and has agreed to vote with the company’s board on most shareholder matters.\nThis suggests a more sophisticated model than the heavy-handed state control of the past. The goal appears to be to provide vital capital and a government seal of approval, ensuring the taxpayer shares in any potential upside from a successful turnaround, without succumbing to the temptation of political meddling in day-to-day operations.\nNonetheless, the risks are profound. The line between a passive partner and an influential stakeholder can blur, especially if Intel’s troubles persist. Future administrations may not share the current hands-off approach. The government is now financially exposed to Intel’s performance, creating a dangerous precedent where corporate failures in strategic sectors become direct liabilities for the public purse. This move fundamentally alters the relationship between the state and private enterprise in a way that could introduce new and unpredictable forms of political and market risk.\nAmerica’s foray into shareholder activism is a reluctant one, born not of ideological conviction but of geopolitical necessity and the fierce technological rivalry with China. The long-held belief in the inherent superiority of the free market is giving way to a pragmatic, if uneasy, embrace of industrial policy.\nThe Intel stake is a bold experiment in this new reality. The critical question is whether America can learn from Europe’s past, deploying the power of the state to nurture a strategic industry without smothering the competitive spirit that made it a world leader in the first place. The American taxpayer now has $10 billion riding on the answer.\nPublished - August 23, 2025 01:01 pm IST"

President Trump announces the U.S. government now has a 10% stake in the tech firm.\nPresident Trump (Truth Social) – “It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.”\nIntel has been struggling for the past several years, and President Trump has been focused on getting Semiconductor and Chip manufacturing established in the USA, a big national security issue. The Trump administration has been negotiating a 10% stake in Intel by converting grants the company was awarded under former President Joe Biden.\nObviously, I’m not a big fan of government collaboration with private corporations, but this approach aligns with a very specific national security issue. This sounds like something Commerce Secretary Lutnick and President Trump would structure as a win/win.\n“The government’s investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company’s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.”\nSomeone will have to convince me that this is a good idea.\nSoftBank of Japan is also investing $2 billion. A side story that is missed out here.\nHow is a free 10% bad in any way?\nI just don’t like government ownership of businesses in any form.\nDetails of the Stake Acquisition:\nOn August 22, 2025, President Trump confirmed that the U.S. government would purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for approximately $8.9 billion, translating to about $20.47 per share—below Intel’s recent market price of $24.80. This investment will be funded through previously awarded but unpaid grants under the CHIPS Act, which aims to support semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.\nWhereas before under the CHIPS act the gov’t was giving away our tax payer and deficit spending money for free, Trump admin is getting 10% ownership in exchange for gov’t grants.\nHe monetized gov’t grants into asset acquisition for the Federal gov’t which is supposed to be for the benefit of We The People.\nThank you for that information.\nIsn’t the historic definition of Fascism that a government took part or whole ownership of a commercial enterprise??\nThis is the reason for giving pause, not that we want Intel to fail as a commercial entity. “National Security” is not a reason to accept or promote historic fascism.\nIF Trump were serious about meritocracy….now would have been the time to prove it.\nHe has injected our government into a place where it doesn’t belong operating: free captialism / markets.\nI do give pause.\nMy above post conveyed an explainer and a Trump is “making lemonade out of lemons” argument.\nIt is.\nYou are 100% correct about the definition. Trump is 100% correct that this is such a strategic capability, that we the people need to step in to prevent collapse until manufacturing gets repatriated.\nSpaceX is another example of an incredibly important strategic capability – space lift – that required a private solution and govt investment. The end result has been getting the US govt out of the main business of rocketry, and that resulted in a collapse (in a good way) of the cost-per-kg-to-orbit for satellites.\nIf we’re going to spend our tax money on something, it should be stuff we desperately need.\nSo the U.S. ought to just hand out the money per Joey,\ninstead of getting a return on the billions?\nThe ‘retarded’ argument of fascism which comes from the FDRcrats has no bearing at all.\n“The government’s investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company’s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.”\nThe USG is not taking voting rights. They won’t be dictating company policy.\nThat’s not Fascism. That’s the definition of a Silent Partner.\nCongress will have to approve the expenditure, right?\nUntil that happens, this is just a nice announcement and this is a really very extremely bad slippery slope for our nation to be on. It already has the left side of the Uniparty willing to jail, even do in lethally, their political opponents and this move gives the right side of that Uniparty bird the justification to nationalize all businesses, whether public or private, for the benefit of fixing the nation’s deficit (instead of just reining in spending).\nPer SD’s post, they are converting grants awarded during the Biden admin to stock.\nIs this legal? When was the authorization for the federal government to become stockholder created? These are the questions I have, and are the questions which need to be answered, in my opinion, so basically the questions I want to have answered.\nGood questions. I didn’t think they could directly invest in stocks either.\nI found this that might be helpful.\nhttps://valueofstocks.com/2022/03/20/government-buy-stocks/\nI’m unsure in this particular example.\nThank you Sunshine\nBiden gave away $ to Intel. Lutnick turned it into an asset.\nRegardless, me and most Treepers shouldn’t be thrilled about Government getting involved in free enterprise. Especially since The Constitution doesn’t says government should own 10% of companies\nRecall Obama took over ownership of GM (New GM as the existing stock had no value). This is a continuation of the industrial policy of Obama and Biden. Sort of like the CCP.\nSeems a bit more complicated, but no SEC filing so far:\n“The government’s investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company’s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.\nThe government will receive a five-year warrant, at $20 per share for an additional five percent of Intel common shares, exercisable only if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of the foundry business.\nThe existing claw-back and profit-sharing provisions associated with the government’s previously dispersed $2.2 billion grant to Intel under the CHIPS Act will be eliminated to create permanency of capital as the company advances its U.S. investment plans.”\nYup, it’s a slippery slope toward corporatism/fascism.\nWe’re from the government and we’re here to “help.”\n… as in “help ourselves”\nIf I were the devil I would help…………\nIt’s not free. They are converting grants.\nOptimal solutions. We the people do not know how close we still are to an economic catastrophic collapse.\nIf not for the hand of God and His placement of PDJT to lead this country at this time, we may have already done so. I know most Treepers already know this. God bless 🙏🏽❤️\nIt gives government more incentive to tip the scales. Some companies should die off.\nAlways consider how this will be used unfavorably by those who want to control us.\nHow about regulations/legislations/permitting, etc. favorable to Intel, but not for rivals such as AMD?\nHow about specifying that every Federal PC has to utilize Intel chips. If the Feds are buying, then price doesn’t matter.\nHow about at least 1 out of every 10 chips has a backdoor into the PC they’re powering?\nGovernment ownership of any private business for any reason is always “bad”.\nu r kidding right?\nI will give you 10% more free super sized…..\nBad in any way?\nThere is nothing free, in business, or in life.\nIt’s already paid for- only Biden was asleep at the time.\nLets say the Democrat crime gang controls government and exercises its Intel ownership to deny sales of chips to Musk in favor of Bezos or the terms are more favorable for one versus the other.\nThat’s bad.\nEven if the government ownership is totally passive i.e no voting, no Board, the ownership may cause changes in government procurement to favor the government owned business, or affect changes in legislation that favors the gov owned vs its competitors.\nHaving explained the “dark side”, let’s look at reality. The Biden give away was granted; Trump got the taxpayers something in return. If Trump did nothing the taxpayers just gave it away with only a more nebulous future benefit. Now over time the government theoretically could sell stock to help reduce debt.\nIt wasn’t free.\n“The Trump administration has been negotiating a 10% stake in Intel by converting grants the company was awarded under former President Joe Biden.”\nBiden gave Intel $7.9b in grants.\nIntel is paying that back as $11b worth of shares (interest added I guess).\nNothing wrong with owning a non-controlling share. Future governments can always sell the shares off.\nSovereign wealth funds (govt owned) own shares all over the place. It’s an investment, not control of means of production.\nFirst it will be 10%….\nWill the USG demand a board seat, or maybe another 10%. Don’t like it!\nMy sentiments exactly! While we can trust this POTUS, we cannot trust successive administrations, regardless of party. Hopefully by the end of Trump’s term the USG is out of this venture.\nTrust\nNo\nOne!\nI don’t think issuing shares is “paying that back”. It’s diluting the ownership of existing shareholders.\nAgreed. Sounds like a win until you step back and think of the long-term consequences. When a Dem gets back into the office of POTUS (they will eventually), this essentially becomes a massive slush fund for all kinds of nefarious activity with no oversight or accountability.\nIntel could have rejected the grants. No corporation has to take the grants thus no government ownership.\nTo me, the government has no business picking winners and losers by “giving” grants to any company. But, since this is reality and it happened and Intel took the grants then tit for tat.\nFree money addiction is 10000x more addictive than heroin.\nGetting ‘government’ into Big Business always leads to shite; medicine, pharmacy, housing, business, and personal jobs and money have all gone to pot because of ‘government’ takeover!!\nGod Help US\nBig ‘government’ Bigger problems for US. Small ‘government’ should always be the goal for real freedom. World Government will lead to Communism; no other outcome can be the outcome.\nIt is not within the Constitution’s definition of the proper role of government. And, a state should not be investing taxpayers money in stocks, like many do. I’ve never looked at Pres. Trump as a constitutionalist, but he often lands as one. A 10 percent ownership/control stake aligns with his business and opportunist mindset. Remember, it was national security concerns that birthed the 4th branch. I greatly respect Sundance’s understanding, but this smacks of socialist thought, which has been engraned into the past two generations so much that we often don’t know when we’re thinking it. Nothing about this sits well with me. But, I will listen to reason. Blind following… not so much.\nRemember what Ronald Reagan said.\nDon’t open the door if they ssy, “were the government and were here to help you”.\n(copy paste my reply to comment above)\nBiden gave Intel $7.9b in grants.\nIntel is paying that back as $11b worth of shares (interest added I guess).\nNothing wrong with owning a non-controlling share. Future governments can always sell the shares off.\nSovereign wealth funds (govt owned) own shares all over the place. It’s an investment, not control of means of production.\nPaying back an advance is one thing.\nTaking a percentage of ownership of an enterprise, by an entity (the federal government) which said entity regulates, approves permits, denies permits, sets rates for fees and taxes, can just as easily set those rates, fees, taxes and permit regulations in an adversarial way to kill any competition.\nTwo different events wrapped up in one to sell to people with the flourish of ‘doing good’.\nThis consumer isn’t buying.\nOur Constitution does not permit Sovereign Wealth Funds and an amendment, passed by a majority of the States, is required to happen in order to allow for such a creature.\nPerhaps President Trump needs to add a few more seasoned government people around and depend a bit less on the high-stakes businessmen he is surrounded with.\nHope someone with some influence on President Trump still reads here now and then – this forgotten American has their shackles up over this misadventure.\n‘Obviously, I’m not a big fan of government collaboration with private corporations, but this approach aligns with a very specific national security issue. ‘\nDefense of fascism ultimately ends up at “National Security”.\nIncluding the current US model of inverted fascism, or corporate-government “partnership” controlled largely from the corporate side.\nThe difference now is that the total surveillance panopticon and control systems are being built along with the fascism. You will either conform and assimilate or be cut off.\nAnd the financial control will be accomplished without CBDC, by stablecoin incorporating the government control via the “public- private partnership” (fascism) sidestepping the central banks and Federal Reserve.\nIt’s all frogmarching us toward the planned end state:\nTotalitarian US participating in the coming totalitarian “multi-polar global governance”.\nWhat about the things degrading the US, like the drugs, economic down force, and biowarfare democide of the coerced genetic manipulation injections? Glad you asked, this and the other degradation programs executing are evidently intended to weaken the US opposition to the frog boil warming up. Political opposition becomes nigh impossible when the people are struggling to survive with the illness and increased deaths in their families from the drugs and the shots, compounded by the economic falling.\nAs long as there is complete transparency, no political influence or corporate governance, I’m good with it.\nhow else can the taxpayers get back the billions in ‘Chip Grants’ that Biden gave to Intel?\nObiden’s “10% for the Big Guy” was to enrich himself to America’s detriment, but President Trump’s is to enrich the People for America’s blessing.\n“Donald Trump gave up his wealth for America. Joe Biden gave up America for his wealth. Know the difference. Donald Trump was too patriotic for Washington, DC.”—Brigitte Gabriel\nI cannot understand why it is so important to have government money invested into huge companies when we do not need these big monopolies but rather many smaller companies. These used to serve the public well so if regulation was seriously reduced they would be able to function economically.\nSounds like a creative win/win/win.\nBut then need to pay attention to future downsides.\nAnd at some future point hopefully, commit these shares to reduce the catastrophic\nnational debt.\nThis is part of the strategic counter to China’s threat against Taiwan.\nThe urgent problem was to allow Intel’s current CEO Lip-Bu Tan to continue\nto guide Intel to success at the leading edge of chip technology despite his\nties to China. Trump and others think Tan can do that.\nThis is much better than the Biden, hose it with $money and grift and\nmove on to another debacle and take a nap, approach.\nMany upsides to this. But adults need to pay attention,\nto see that it does not slip back into more Biden level corruption.\nI am vigorously opposed to this action.\nI don’t care if there might be a “good” reason to do this. But the Federal government has NO BUSINESS owning even one share of any private sector business — no matter how “vital” to national security!\nVery disappointed in this action.\nWho do you think “ownes” Raytheon, Lockheed, Northrop…\nIntel Public Statement Here:\n“The government’s investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights. The government also agrees to vote with the Company’s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.”\nI think this is the key element, the government will largely be passive but has retained the right to vote against the board of directors on limited exceptions. Major corporate decisions such as mergers and acquisitions, election of the board, or amendment of the bylaws require shareholder consent. It is in these details that the US Government is likely gaining the protection against Intel being merged or acquired by a non-US (read: Chinese) corporation. Other than the limited exceptions, the USG shares will support all board actions.\nWhat are the “exceptions?” Who determines when an “exception” is an “exception”? Isn’t the word “exception” synonymous with “loophole” (usually to the detriment of regular folks)?\nI do not like gov’t owning private businesses. Trump needs to sell those shares before he leaves office b/c Dems will abuse such ownership if they get back in power!\nA colleague of mine – spent most of his career at intel – was laid off a few weeks ago here in AZ. He was part of many others getting pink slips. Semi cos are dumping us citizen talent while complaining they need more h1b. Its frustrating to see america first progress of maga, but the reality is that dot com bust 2.0 seems to be accelerating.\nIs it possible we are witnessing the next phase of non kinetic ww3? USG gets control of key industries in wartime. Its happened before.\nSo… from some guys in California who started Intel to Lip-Bu_Tan who turned the company towards China…\nThe guy has an impressive background for sure, but when we offshored chip manufacturing because it was cheap slave labor, I lost my faith in the American ideal of innovation + manufacturing. Tons of people in America lost their jobs during that transition. I had the privilege of touring a sub-micron facility in Santa Clara back in the day before all the big layoffs. And then there was the onslaught of H1B Visa holders. And Musk can go to hell on that point.\nI welcome Trump pushing to get manufacturing back on our soil. Not sure this move is the right way, but I’m just a grain of sand in the sea of opinions.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip-Bu_Tan\nI trust President Trump. And I understand this is, at the moment, better than just handing out our tax dollars and we the people get nothing in return.\nBut how is any of this fair to other U.S. companies like AMD?\nPut me in the against column. Fascist policy is not freedom for anyone. We see that in Israeli companies where the state owns a golden share and can control the sale of the company and manipulate its policies. No thank you. The market could have absorbed these shares and paid those grants.\nThis is going to be the disaster that gives life to the left wing’s claim that President Trump and his administration are fascists.\nOur government is NEVER allowed to pick winners or losers when it comes to the business world, whether private or public, it is only allowed to set the rules, and then if the enterprise breaks the rule, equal application regardless of the company must apply.\nThis Intel venture needs to be fully explained, and be approved by Congress, and if needed new laws passed. This event, combined with President Trump’s refusal to shut down Tik Tok as the Supreme Court has ruled, simply awaits that 3rd item (trouble comes in three, as the saying goes) that will create the image needed by the left to win the next election, and once they gain control of the House and Senate in 2026, to not only impeach, but remove him from office. Once that happens then Peter Theil’s man becomes President so don’t be surprised if all those new pro-GOP tech fans side with the Democrats just so they can put their man in the top spot.\nAppeasing Chinese controlled companies in the hopes of making a good trade deal with communist China is not the winning strategy President Trump thinks it is. China doesn’t care, just as we re seeing Russia doesn’t care. Both have obviously read his book, The Art of the Deal, and are stringing him along by playing to his businessman persona.\nSad that this is happening at all.\nBusinesses are meant, in our capitalist society, to live or die by their own. If both those businesses go under, better ones will appear, ones in line with the rules and laws that all the other businesses in our country must follow.\nGov doesn’t pick winners and losers? Have you lived or witnessed the past century and to wit the last 25 years- the calamity of 2008,8,10? The $800b bailout of selected entities? On deeper level The cartel of central bankers and the corruption of legislatures via lobbyists ,The IRS? The MID? Regulatory favoritism, NGO’s… I’m not sure in outcomes, is there much difference? It’s not fair nor free enterprise.\nAmazing that Intel went from a large college like campus in Silicon Valley under John Chambers…(The campus included design, engineering, and manufacturing of the latest and greatest of all chip technologies…) then they went totally offshore with a CCP oriented CEO… my how we have fallen as a country…\nPraying that VSGPDJT turns this around…\nPublic-Private partnership, such as this, is one of the keystones of FASCISM. [For those who may be unsure regarding the fundamental tenets of fascism, read “The Doctrine of Fascism,” by Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile. Otherwise, read “Friendly Fascism” by Bertam Gross.]\nSocialism, generally speaking, is full STATE OWNERSHIP of private industry; that is, the STATE OWNERSHIP of the private means of production. Fascism — the bastard stepchild of socialism — is the STATE CONTROL of the private means of production; where the STATE does not outright own such private concerns, but, rather the STATE, through various means, CONTROLS them … for example, through rules and regs or PARTNERSHIPS; where, thereby, the private concerns receives huge economic benefits — sometimes, near monopolistic advantages — in exchange for “playing ball with the STATE”.\n[Other than these economic differences, the only other difference of significance between socialism and fascism is that socialism, ultimately, holds international objectives, while fascism is focused on strict nationalism.. Other than this, in any given real world example, one is hard pressed to distinguish between either of these comprehensively evil ideologies.]\nFascism … aka STATE-RUN Capitalism or Crony Capitalism, or, as I prefer to call it, Crony Profiteering … because such arrangements have next to nothing to do with open, free, and fair capitalism or any respectable private concern that is open to true competition.\nThis fascistic model is what the vast majority of NGO’s — again, another example of Public-Private Partnerships — are all about; where they are a means by which the STATE, without being directly responsible — other than TONS of taxpayer dollars — can get private actors to do the STATE’s bidding … while escaping STATE accountability. IOW: this is just a back-door means by which the STATE picks winners and losers … and works to control their SUBJECTS. [Note: populations living under such conditions are certainly not CITIZENS.]\nIt should be clear to one and all that the large majority — all? — of these STATE practices are a massively dangerous slippery slope. They are KILLERS of OPEN-FREE MARKETS; they are killers of free competition … motivated primarily, and, I will estimate solely, by factional politics.\nFor anyone looking to explain the great “Wealth Disparity of Individuals and Businesses”, look no further; such fascistic disparity exists largely because STATES, at the direction of those who have the resources and ambitions to do so, pay for STATES, particularly in the structure of their tax code, to make it so in their benefit. Such are happy partnerships … but not for anyone else.\nIn our NATION of FREE CITIZENS — that is, while we remain FREE with our remaining liberties — the only way such criminal activity — totally unconstitutional, really — can be stopped, effectively, is for We The People, collectively, to choose to do something about it; where such choosing would demand that We The People return our focus of all such national efforts back to our Fundamental American Principles. [For anyone who may be unsure regarding these fundamental principles, they are presented clearly, in plain black and white English language, in The Unanimous Declaration of 4 July 1776.]\nTruly, this would be the only way by which we, as a NATION, could ever hope to MAGA & MAHA!\nThe STATE (the U.S. Government) already has control – through money infusions as well as congressional votes and regulators’ rules. The Deep State used the private sector to negate free speech during covid and DEI using its already-existing control mechanisms.\nCertainly, in general, I agree.\nOur USA GOVT — whhere GOVT is the “toolbox” of the Federal STATE — has been working FOR SEVERAL DECADES with massive PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS of ALL kinds; where, of course, any and all such STATE efforts — many in illegal or immoral partnership with Private Concerns — are financed with OUR TAX DOLLARS.\nFUNDAMENTALLY, all such STATE efforts are UNCONSTITUTIONAL and should be — MUST BE — recognized by many more of We The People as CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES and, in turn, should be treated accordingly.\nI, and others, FOR DECADES, have been writing and speaking about this NATIONAL SHAME — read: our FASCISTIC USA SYSTEM OF STATE — which seems, month by month, to be getting worse.\nIOW: OUR NATION, for a long time, has been and continues to be “run” by a FASCISTIC FEDERAL STATE system. All of this is absolutely totally 180 degrees out of phase with our Fundamental American Principles.\nThe saddest part of all of this, however, is that the vast majority of We The People — LEGAL CITIZENS or otherwise — have next to no idea what this all means; they have next to no idea what is being written here on this particular blog site — in the Sundance articles and in our comments — as well as what is being written on many other pro-USA sites. Such a systemic shortcoming, if remaining unchecked, will lead to our national downfall … sooner rather than later.\nIn the meantime, to put a point on it, at this moment, we, as a NATION, are NO WHERE near to being a socialistic state; however, to repeat, we, as a NATION have been controlled, for a very long time, by a centralized top-down FASCISTIC FED STATE.\nNo NEW LAWS are going to correct this; certainly not if most of us have no clue as to what is going on. Making new laws, til the cows come home, but that will neotjer address nor solve one iota of this systemic problem.\nThe only hope we have — that is, to remain as CITIZENS and not be transformed to SUBJECTS — is for a whole bunch more of WE The People to learn and APPLY, to our system of GOVT, the true meaning of Fundamental Americanism; where such is defined by both our RIGHTS but also — and more importantly — by our DUTIES.\nMost Americans know of such RIGHTS, but, for those who are unsure of such DUTIES, see them presented clearly in The Unanimous Declaration of 4 July 1776. Only through our collective adherence to such DUTIES can we have any reasonable chance at MAGA & MAHA!\nIndeed!\nI’ll be watching to see if this changes the timetable for PRC to invade Taiwan.\nNone of this would have been necessary if the CIA hadn’t overthrown Nationalist Chy-Na and installed Mao.\nWe can’t have all our chips made over there, and without our President, they would still be.\nAs Sundance says, we already have Inverted Fascism, Corporations over Government. Half of DC is on China’s payroll and this is a counter to that, IMO.\nWhere are all the Conservatives freaking out over Communism??\nI am sure many of you would be crying if Biden took percentages of big corps.\nThey took big percentages of him.\nps; taking the Woke Tour Guides out of James Madison’s Home Montpelier would be Great Start to the Restoration, Mr. President.\n“We are free today substantially, but the day will come when our Republic will be an impossibility. It will be an impossibility because wealth will be concentrated in the hands of a few. A Republic cannot stand upon bayonets, and when the day comes when the wealth of the nation will be in the hands of a few, then we must rely upon the wisdom of the best elements in the country to readjust the laws of the nations to the changed conditions.”\nSocialize the risk, privatize the profit…now where have we seen that beforrre?\nI still remember when Intel built that massive plant near Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs. Then, before producing anything, they laid off all the employees, shuttered the factory, and offshored production.\nThanks George W Bush!\nPS: the (empty) factory building is still there.\nThis is what we get, almost invariably, sooner rather than later, when We The People, collectively, let GOVT — REGARDLESS of which political party is currently driving GOVT policy — get materially involved in private enterprise … such as INTEL and countless 1000s of others. [We’re in pretty deep and we have created a massive problem.]\nDo you not understand this? Are you surprised by the results?\nGOVT involvement in private enterprise — generally known as FASCISM — is a KILLER of open, free, and fair competition. Such Public-Private Partnerships — and almost ALL NGO’s fit this categorization — have no place in our American way of life.\nGOVT, in our USA, is there for one role, and one role only: to protect fairly and equally the certain unalienable rights of each and every LEGAL American CITIZEN. The more we take GOVT away from this task — in whichever direction — the more likely we CITIZENS will become SUBJECTS.\nThe ONLY solution to this UNCONSTITUTIONAL GOVT involvement is that We The People, in much larger numbers, insist that our GOVT actors cease and desist with all such activity.\nIOW: We The People need to insist that our GOVT adhere strictly to Fundamental American Tenets; specifically, those as presented in THE Unanimous Declaration of 4 July 1776.\nSuch is up to us — We The People; again, as stated in The Unanimous Declaration — and to us, alone. No law is going to do the trick, especially when those who we elect to create, enforce, and prosecute the law are way too many self-serving sociopathic JUDASES, who, at the drop of a hat, will sell down the river … each and every one of us.\nYou know what else would help with company profitability? Not having a ceo compromised by china.\nWhen will we stop this? Did you read about that major Chinese company now under the full leadership of an American? Yeah, me neither. It will never happen and that is correct. But, over here, we cannot wait to give our tech away to CEO’s whose allegiance is to a foreign adversary. It is madness.\nA Public/Private partnership works well when you consider the implications of not having access to this technology in a national crisis. We are so very fortunate to have a POTUS who sees the security and safety ramifications of all of these “offshore” produced items that could potentially devastate our country if the supply were to be cut of during a conflict. Whether it be pharmaceuticals, medical supplies/equipment, silicon chips or energy, bringing the manufacture of them to the USA is a boon for national security and safety for all.\nA stumbling block for Chyna is a nice move.\n==Abracadabra INTEL no more investing in Chinese companies==. And America owns 10% of a chip company. With the businessman that is President. Great deal\nI’ve come to the conclusion that if you have billions, you think anything can be solved with throwing money at it.\nIf you’re not wealthy, you realize that’s simply not the case.\nYou realize there’s something much greater at work here that has nothing to do with a dollar bill.\nIntel was hurting from the rise of NVDIA and was on their way out.\nHowever, the defense contractors have a tremendous number of products that operate on Intel chips.\nIt would be a nightmare if they had to second source another chip supplier.\nTrump did the right thing to shore up Intel.\nIs the CEO Thai or Chinese?\nI pray something is being done about the origins of our electrical power infrastructure also, as chips won’t matter without kws.\nThis is a good read….and a different perspective on this deal that you might find interesting…\n—-\nTrump’s Intel Deal Shows How America Can Win by Investing in Itself\nChinese investors privately take stakes in Elon Musk’s companies\nRead more at: https://www.deccanherald.com/business/chinese-investors-privately-take-stakes-in-elon-musks-companies-3439103"

      "text": "On Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. government was now a part-owner of a major publicly traded tech company. The reaction among his base was less than enthusiastic.\nTrump announced via his Truth Social platform that as of Friday the U.S. is a multibillion-dollar shareholder in Intel as part of an agreement with CEO Lip-Bu Tan — with the U.S. supposedly paying nothing for its new stake. The announcement notably came roughly two weeks after Trump's angry social media tirade against Tan, in which he demanded that Tan \"resign immediately\" from his role due to his investments in Chinese tech companies.\n\"It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,\" Trump wrote in his signature style of oddly placed capital letters. \"I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"\nSpeaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.\n“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,” Trump said. “He agreed, and they’ve agreed to do it.”\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the agreement.\nThe struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.\nThe official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel’s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world’s largest economy.\nIn his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\nTrump’s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nThat’s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan’s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an “amazing story.”\nThe company isn’t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.\nIntel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel’s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration’s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company’s chips.\nIntel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn’t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.\nThe company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program — money that Lutnick derided as a “giveaway” that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it’s turned into Intel stock. “We think America should get the benefit of the bar\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

And I think it's a great deal,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday, CNN reported.\nThe agreement Trump announced is part of an effort to help boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States, although it is not immediately clear how the Trump administration aims to be involved in the company's strategic decision-making, according to the CNN report.\nTrump also said he would do more of these types of deals. His administration has been weighing opportunities to take similar stakes in various U.S. companies in critical industries, two people familiar with the White House discussions on the matter told CNN last week.\n\"If the effort happens, it would be among the largest government interventions in a U.S. company since the rescue of the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis,\" The New York Times reported Friday. \"To prevent the collapse of Chrysler and General Motors, the government poured tens of billions of dollars into the companies and helped them reorganize.\"\nTrump cast the agreement as one that would revitalize the company, saying that \"Intel has been left behind\" compared to its competitors in the chipmaking industry, Bloomberg said in its report about the event.\n\"The U.S. taking partial ownership would mark a stunning level of intervention in an American company, shattering norms that investors and policymakers have long considered sacrosanct except in the most extraordinary situations such as war or a systemic economic crisis,\" Bloomberg reported.\nIntel was the largest recipient of U.S. funds as part of former President Joe Biden's CHIPS Act, which sought to provide government grants and tax breaks to semiconductor companies that agreed to build new factories in the United States, Bloomberg said."

      "text": "President Donald Trump said Intel Corp. has agreed to hand the US government a ten per cent equity stake, with a formal announcement expected on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter.\nHailing the deal as a “multibillion-dollar win for taxpayers” and a turning point for the struggling chipmaker, Trump said the partial ownership marked a new era in how Washington supports critical industries.\nThe move would represent an extraordinary level of intervention in an American company, breaking with long-held norms that such measures are usually reserved for times of war or systemic financial crisis. Intel declined to comment on the timing of the announcement. Shares in the company rose as much as 6.6 per cent on Friday.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick underscored the shift in approach, telling CNBC earlier this week that the goal is to “get a good return for the American taxpayer instead of just giving grants away.”\nAlthough the administration has not disclosed full details of its negotiations with Intel, a US official said companies expanding their US investments—such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Micron Technology Inc.—would not be required to offer equity in exchange for federal support.\nThe Intel deal underscores both risks and rewards: the possibility of heavy taxpayer losses if the investment falters, but also the chance of reviving a company that once led the chip industry and is now seen as falling behind competitors.\nTrump has increasingly tied industrial policy to direct state involvement. In early August, he announced Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. had agreed to give the government 15 per cent of revenue from AI chip sales to China. Earlier this year, he also secured a “Golden Share” from Nippon Steel Corp. in its deal for United States Steel Corp., granting him veto power over key decisions."

      "text": "US government snaps up 10% of Intel for $8.9B\nThe funds were already allocated under the CHIPS Act and Secure Enclave program\nCongratulations America, your government now owns 10 percent of troubled domestic chipmaker Intel.\nIntel and the government announced the deal late on Friday. Under it, Intel will get $5.7 billion in grants that officials had allocated but not yet paid under former President Biden's CHIPS and Science Act. The government gave Chipzilla an additional $3.2 billion under the Secure Enclave program, which is supposed to be used to develop high-security chips for US government and military use. Intel has already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants so far, giving it quite the war chest.\n\"It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of Intel, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,\" President Trump announced on his social media site Truth Social.\n\"I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for Intel.\"\nIndeed, Intel's shares closed the day up more than 5%, giving the company a market cap of nearly $110 billion, which would make the US government's stake worth about $11 billion. That said, the government did not pay nothing for the shares, although it used money that had already been allocated under previous programs, so no new money was spent.\nIntel has been desperately trying to drum up more funding as it seeks to regain its position as one of the top chipmakers in the world. The cash will give it a much-needed lifeline to rebuild its advanced chip-making capabilities and move production stateside and away from Asian vendors like TSMC.\nThe deal also represents a personal win for the relatively new CEO, who took over in March. At the start of the month, the president was calling for Tan's resignation as he was \"highly CONFLICTED,\" but after some frantic diplomacy he's now back in the government's good books it seems.\n\"As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the US, Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,\" said Tan in a statement.\n\"President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security. We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership.\"\n- Uncle Sam eyes slice of Intel in return for CHIPS Act cash\n- Trump does a 180 on Intel chief following White House meeting\n- India's PM laments missing out on global chipmaking dominance – in 1964!\n- GlobalFoundries inks domestic chipmaking deal with Cirrus Logic\nIn addition to taking a 10 percent stake, the government reserves the right to buy an additional 5 percent of the company at $20 per share, a considerable discount on the current stock market price of around $25. The government won't have a seat on the board, and has said it will back the current management with \"limited exceptions.\"\n\"Intel is excited to welcome the United States of America as a shareholder, helping to create the most advanced chips in the world,\" said the United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. \"As more companies look to invest in America, this administration remains committed to reinforcing our country’s dominance in artificial intelligence while strengthening our national security.\"\nRumors about the investment have circulated for a while and, on the face of it, looks like a very good deal for American taxpayers. For decades Intel has spent tens of billions propping up its share price with stock buybacks and returns to investors, while failing to get to grips with advanced chip design and manufacturing.\nUnder the circumstances just handing them money with nothing to show for it would look like a dumb move. Now the US has a direct stake in a domestic chip company that could prove both lucrative, and also is necessary to ensure the US gets its chips from a friendly supplier in the homeland. ®"

All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — a discount from Friday’s closing price at $24.80. That spread means the US government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper.\nThe remarkable turn of events makes the US government one of Intel’s largest shareholders at a time that the Santa Clara, California, company is in the process of jettisoning more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to bounce back from years of missteps taken under a variety of CEOs.\nIntel’s current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months, and earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist. Trump latched on to those concerns in an August 7 post demanding that Tan resign.\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the US in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the US government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023. Trump hailed Tan as “highly respected” CEO in his Friday post.\nIn a statement, Tan applauded Trump for “driving historic investments in a vital industry” and resolved to reward his faith in Intel. “We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership,” Tan said.\nIntel’s current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60 percent below its peak of about $75 reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later. The company’s market value currently stands at about $108 billion — a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion.\nThe stake is coming primarily through US government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act that was started under President Joe Biden’s administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips to lessen the dependence on overseas factories.\nBut the Trump administration, which has regularly pilloried the policies of the Biden administration, saw the CHIPs act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to make a profit off the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n“We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. “It’s obvious that it’s the right move to make.”\nAbout $7.8 billion had been been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded so far. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called “Secure Enclave.”\nAlthough US government can’t vote with its shares and won’t have a seat on Intel’s board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could hurt the tech industry in a variety of ways.\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time that he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n“Overall, it’s a horrendous move that will have real harms for US companies, US tech leadership, and the US economy overall,” Lincicome posted Friday.\nThe 10 percent stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel’s stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating his past successes in business.\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago because of all the challenges facing Intel.\n“I don’t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,” Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel’s business.\n“I don’t care how good of businessman you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government.,” Tengler said.\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the US government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60 percent stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nThe US government’s stake in Intel coincides with Trump’s push to bring production to the US, which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the US will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nEven before gaining the 10 percent stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15 percent commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\nTrump turns $11.1 billion in US government funds into a 10 percent stake in downtrodden Intel\nhttps://arab.news/ypqd4\nTrump turns $11.1 billion in US government funds into a 10 percent stake in downtrodden Intel\n- US govt getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges, making a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper\n- Remarkable turn of events comes at a time that the chipmaker is in the process of laying off more than 20,000 workers in bid to bounce back from years of missteps"

      "text": "The US government has officially taken a 10% stake in Intel in what seems to be a bid to save the chip maker, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick unveiled in a post on X on Friday.\nIntel confirmed its agreement with the Trump Administration in a press release issued late Friday, saying it reflects \"the confidence the administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"\nUnder the deal, the US government is committing $8.9 billion to purchase Intel stock, which would give the government a 9.9% stake in the company. That's in addition to the $2.2 billion grant Intel has already received from the US under the CHIPS Act, which was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022.\n\"President Trump's focus on US chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country's economic and national security,\" said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, adding that \"Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world's most advanced technologies are American-made.\"\nThe move shows the incredible importance of semiconductors as economic growth hinges increasingly on the chips that power generative artificial intelligence. The data center boom spurred by the meteoric rise of AI has a few key bottlenecks, with the availability of essential chips being perhaps the most significant. These data centers also rely heavily on access to sometimes scarce energy, water and land. The US also faces intense competition from China for the tools to develop more advanced AI models, including semiconductors.\nLutnick said in the press release that the Trump administration \"remains committed to reinforcing our country's dominance in artificial intelligence while strengthening our national security.\"\nIn comments made on the CNBC show Squawk on the Street, Lutnick justified the move as a way to ensure American taxpayers get the most from investments made via the CHIPS Act -- legislation meant to supercharge domestic chip manufacturing.\n\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Lutnick said.\nThe government won't have a seat on Intel's board, however.\nThe CEOs of Microsoft, Dell, HP and AWS commented on the investment, each citing the importance of the US semiconductor industry.\n\"Leading-edge semiconductors are the bedrock of every AI technology and cloud platform, making US investment in this critical industry one of the most important technological, economic and national security imperatives of our time,\" said AWS CEO Matt Garman. \"Intel plays a vital role as one of the country's leading chip manufacturers.\"\nNeither the Department of Commerce nor Intel immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe move is a major change in US corporate policy but isn't without precedent. Usually, the federal government will only enter the private market in certain emergency situations. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the government took a 60% stake in General Motors and took equity stakes in major banks to help the financial system.\nThe Intel stake is a tad unusual in that the US isn't currently helping corral resources for a major war, and there isn't a financial crisis gripping the country. What is happening, however, is increased global competition in chip fabrication and AI.\nMicroprocessors are the brains that power pretty much every electronic device currently on the market. Advanced chips are also necessary for powering the next generation of artificial intelligence systems. Intel, a once-lauded American chipmaker, has been struggling to break through a competitive market where the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has run away with advanced fabrication.\nOn the chip design end, both Nvidia and AMD have led the charge in US innovation, effectively powering the world's AI, cloud and computing systems. Intel made some bad design decisions and risky bets that ultimately haven't paid off. As a result, electronics makers are looking toward other companies and designs to power their products."

The semiconductor company's share price gained 5.5% in a day of trading that saw the S&P 500 jump 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite surge 1.8%.\nIntel's valuation climbed today thanks to a speech from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell that increased hopes among investors for an interest rate cut at the central bank's meeting next month. The stock also got a boost from a report suggesting that the Trump administration was on the verge of announcing that it was on track to acquire a 10% stake in the company.\nInterest rate news boosted Intel stock today\nPowell gave a speech this morning that has restored market confidence in a September interest rate cut and the potential for another rate cut later in the year. The Fed has kept rates relatively high in order to combat inflation, but investors have been hoping that the central bank will deliver cuts and create a stronger environment for stocks and other assets.\nWhile Powell said that inflation continued to present challenges, he indicated that weakness in the U.S. economy was looking like the bigger risk factor. His comments seemed to indicate that the Fed is leaning toward cutting rates next month, and they helped power gains for Intel and many other tech stocks today.\nIntel also rose thanks to major U.S. investment news\nBloomberg published a report today stating that President Donald Trump was on track to announce that the U.S. government would be taking a nearly 10% equity position in Intel. The official announcement wound up arriving after the market closed today, but Trump did confirm that he had met with CEO Lip-bu Tan and that the U.S. will be taking a 10% stake in Intel.\nThe development will allow Intel to receive funding that had been apportioned to it through the CHIPS Act. It also opens the door for additional government support as artificial intelligence (AI) chip designs and chip fabrication technologies become increasingly important to the economy and national security."

The announcement notably came roughly two weeks after Trump's angry social media tirade against Tan, in which he demanded that Tan \"resign immediately\" from his role due to his investments in Chinese tech companies.\n\"It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,\" Trump wrote in his signature style of oddly placed capital letters. \"I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

      "text": "Chipmaker Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a nearly 10% stake in its business.\nIntel, which has a major research and development campus in Hillsboro, Oregon, said in a statement the U.S. government will buy $8.9 billion in Intel common stock.\nNearly $6 billion of that will be funded with previously awarded, but not yet paid, grants from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, according to the company.\n“President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in the statement.\n“We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.”\nIntel said the government’s investment will not include voting or governance power.\nSpeaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Tan — which came days after the president called for him to resign over his past ties to China.\n“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,” Trump said. “He agreed, and they’ve agreed to do it.”\nThe struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group said Monday it’s accumulating a 2% stake in Intel.\nIntel is headquartered in California but considers its Hillsboro campus the heart of its research and development. The semiconductor firm employs around 18,000 people in Oregon, making it among the state’s largest private employers.\nOnce the world’s top chipmaker, Intel fell behind in the race to develop technology for smartphones and artificial intelligence. The company reported a loss of nearly $19 billion last year, after recording a $1.7 billion profit in 2023.\nTan was brought on as CEO to help the company catch up. Since he took over at the helm earlier this year, the company has announced it would slow down manufacturing and shed thousands of jobs. Last month the company told Oregon officials it was cutting nearly 2,400 positions from its facilities in Washington County.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick foreshadowed the announcement of the government’s stake in Intel in an interview on CNBC earlier this week. It drew criticism from both of Oregon’s U.S. Senators.\n“This is nothing more than corporate extortion from Donald Trump and his cabinet of bobbleheads acting more like a mob family squeezing out protection money than an administration working in our economy’s best interests,” Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement to OPB on Wednesday.\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said the move would hurt the semiconductor industry instead of help give it a needed boost.\n“This latest scheme is nothing more than an attempt to distract from Trump’s chaotic tariff and trade policies that are hurting American businesses and consumers and causing chaos in the market,” Merkley said in a statement.\nWhat’s happening?\nThe Trump administration has been in talks to secure a stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. The deal makes U.S. government one of Intel’s largest shareholders, and blurs the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world’s largest economy.\nWhy would Trump do this?\nIn his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\nTrump’s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nDidn’t Trump want Intel’s CEO to quit?\nThat’s what the president said Aug. 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan’s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees. Tan also went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an “amazing story.”\nWhy would Intel do a deal?\nIntel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.\nIntel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.\nIs this deal unusual?\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nWould the government run Intel?\n“The government’s investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights,” Intel said in its statement about the deal. “The government also agrees to vote with the Company’s Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.”\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel’s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company.\nBut some analysts wonder if the Trump administration’s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company’s chips.\nWhat government grants does Intel receive?\nIntel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn’t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.\nThe company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program."

Intel's stock soared following the remarks, finishing the trading day up nearly 6%. The stock was trading down around 1% in after-hours trading following Intel's confirmation of a deal.\n\"The government's investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights,\" Intel said in its announcement. \"The government also agrees to vote with the Company's Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.\"\nA struggling American tech giant whose CEO came under political scrutiny\nIntel has seen its market share decline as foreign rivals like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company grow.\nThe company is attempting a turnaround, and its CEO recently found himself caught up in political crosshairs.\nTrump met with Intel's CEO earlier this month at the White House after calling for Tan's \"immediate\" resignation due to his reported investments in Chinese companies. Following the meeting, Trump sounded a much different tone, praising Tan's \"amazing story.\"\nTrump talked about some of his recent deal discussions with Tan in his White House remarks on Friday.\n\"I said, you know what, I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel,\" Trump said. \"And he said, I would consider that. I said, well, I'd like you to do that because Intel's been left behind as, you know, compared to Jensen.\"\n\"I said I think it would be good having the United States as your partner. He agreed. And they've agreed to do it, and I think it's a great deal for them, and I think it's a great deal,\" Trump added.\n\"He walked in wanting to keep his job, and he wound up giving us $10 billion to the United States. So we picked up $10 billion,\" Trump said. \"And we do a lot of deals like that. I'll do more of them.\"\nEarlier in the week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US would not use any stake in Intel to pressure companies.\n\"Yeah, the last thing we're going to do is put pressure, is to take a stake and then try to drum up business,\" Bessent said during an interview on CNBC.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, but like his predecessor, he wants to increase the share of semiconductors made in the US.\n\"A revitalized US chip industry will generate thousands of high-paying jobs, reinforce our technological leadership, and protect our supply chains from disruption by foreign rivals,\" reads Trump's AI Action Plan, which was published last month.\nSemiconductors are difficult to manufacture, especially the more advanced a chip becomes. Still, they are a major component in everything from smartphones to AI. Global chip shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened concerns that the US is too reliant on foreign production for the cornerstone of modern technology. Intel is one of just a handful of US companies that both manufactures and designs chips.\nThe US taking a stake in Intel illustrates the White House's growing support for aggressive intervention into the private sector. The US holds a so-called \"golden share\" in United States Steel Corp, and the Pentagon announced in July that it would take a $400 million preferred equity stake in MP Materials Corp, a US-based rare earth producer.\n\"As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the US, Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world's most advanced technologies are American-made,\" Intel CEO Tan said in the Friday announcement."

      "text": "The Volokh Conspiracy\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\nTrump's Acquisition of Stake in Intel Highlights Similiarities Between Right-Wing Nationalist and Left-Wing Socialist Economic Policies\nBoth are prone to promoting government planning and control of the economy, and both have common flaws.\nDonald Trump's acquisition of a 10% federal government stake in Intel, a major electronics firm, is an example of the dangerous similarities between right-wing nationalist and left-wing socialist economic policies. Both favor extensive government control, direction, and - as in this case - even ownership of industry. As Reason's Eric Boehm points out, the idea of US government ownership of major computer chip manufacturers was previously advanced by socialist Senator Bernie Sanders. More generally, Steven Greenhut notes, \"MAGA's 'right-wing' policies sometimes seem indistinguishable from left-wing ones.\" Government control of the economy is central to Trump's massive imposition of new tariffs, his immigration restrictions, and more.\nIn our 2024 article \"The Case Against Nationalism,\" my Cato Institute colleague Alex Nowrasteh outline a wide range of similarities between nationalist and socialist economic policies, and also explained how they have common flaws:\nNationalists in the United States and elsewhere advocate wide-ranging government control of the economy, most notably in the form of industrial policy, protectionism, and immigration restrictionism. In this respect, the nationalism of the right has much in common with the socialism of the left. It's no accident that the more extreme early 20th-century nationalists, such as the Nazis and Italian fascists, explicitly sought to appropriate socialist economic policies for purposes of helping their preferred ethnic groups, as opposed to the more expressly universalist objectives of left-wing socialists. It should not, therefore, be surprising that nationalist economic policies have many of the same flaws as their socialist counterparts…\nGiven the overlap between nationalism and socialism, it should not be surprising that their economic policies have many of the same pitfalls. The most significant are knowledge problems and perverse incentives arising from dangerous concentrations of power.\nDuring the mid-20th century, Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek famously argued that socialism cannot work because central planners lack the knowledge needed to determine which goods to produce and in what quantities — a concept commonly referred to as the \"knowledge problem.\" Market prices, he argued, enable producers to know the relative value of different goods and services, and to determine how much consumers value their products.\nNationalist economic planners, like their socialist counterparts, have no way of knowing this information. They also have no good way of determining which industries government should promote and how much it should promote them….\nFor these reasons, nationalist economic planning has produced poverty and stagnation — much like its socialist counterpart. Such were the results in nations like Argentina (where nationalism wrecked one of Latin America's most successful economies), Spain, and Portugal under their nationalist regimes.\nAs for the incentive problem, nationalist economic policy — like socialism — requires concentrated government power. Only thus can politicians and bureaucrats promote their favored industries, exclude foreign goods and workers, and so on. Yet government actors are not disciplined by market prices, nor are they incentivized to seek profit by satisfying consumers like firms in the private sector. They are instead guided by the demands of political leaders and direct their energies toward pleasing state authorities, who increasingly control the purse strings….\nNationalism does not resolve the knowledge or incentive problems that undermine socialism; government-dominated economies have the same deficiencies regardless of whether the state swears allegiance to a mythical international proletariat, an ethno-cultural group, or a leader who supposedly embodies its culture and virtues… Depending on the degree of state control of the economy, the results may include mismanagement, cronyism, and economic ossification. Nationalism is no substitute for market prices and incentives.\nAs Alex likes to put it, nationalism is socialism with different flags, and more ethnic chauvinism.\nObviously, we are not the first to point out the similarities between nationalism and socialism. The great libertarian economist F.A. Hayek warned about the same tendency in his 1960 essay \"Why I am Not a Conservative\":\n[T]his nationalistic bias… frequently provides the bridge from conservatism to\ncollectivism: to think in terms of \"our\" industry or resource is only a short step away\nfrom demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest.\nNot all conservatives are nationalistic in this way. Those who are not would do well to condemn right-wing central planning of the economy no less than the left-wing version. Both are harmful and dangerous, for many of the same reasons.\nIn addition to it similarities with socialism, nationalist ideology also poses some distinct dangers of its own, such as promoting ethnic bigotry and xenophobia and undermining democratic institutions in ways somewhat different from those characteristic of socialism. Nowrasteh and I cover them in some detail in other parts of our article.\nShow Comments (122)"

So we picked up $10 billion,\" Trump said on Friday.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that Tan had struck a deal \"that's fair to Intel and fair to the American people\".\nPLAYING CATCH UP\nThe Intel investment marks the latest unusual deal with US companies, including a US government agreement allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for receiving 15 per cent of those sales.\nOther recent deals include an agreement for the Pentagon to become the largest shareholder in a small mining company, MP Materials, to boost output of rare earth magnets and the US government's winning a \"golden share\" with certain veto rights as part of a deal to allow Japan's Nippon Steel to buy US Steel.\nThe federal government's broad intervention in corporate matters has worried critics, who say Trump's actions create new categories of corporate risk.\nAhead of the US deal with Intel, Japan's SoftBank agreed to take a US$2 billion stake in the chip maker on Monday.\nSome industry observers still question Intel's ability to surmount its problems.\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said Intel's problems are beyond a cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government, singling out Intel's contract chip manufacturing business, known as its foundry unit.\n\"Without government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be difficult for the Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,\" he said.\nIntel \"needs to catch up with TSMC from a technological perspective to attract business\", he added.\nThe US government's stake is to be passive ownership and does not include a board seat, Intel said.\nThe government will be required to vote with Intel's board when shareholder approval is necessary, with \"limited exceptions\". Intel did not specify the exceptions.\nThe equity stake also includes a five-year warrant at US$20 a share for an additional 5 per cent of Intel stock, which the US can use if Intel loses control of the foundry business.\nFederal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive its loss-making foundry business, analysts said. It has ceded the AI market to Nvidia and has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in its central processor business for several years.\nIt has also faced challenges in attracting customers to its new factories. Tan, who became CEO in March, has been tasked to turn around the American chipmaking icon, which recorded an annual loss of US$18.8 billion in 2024 - its first such loss since 1986. The company's last fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021.\nReuters reported exclusively in April that Tan invested at least US$200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military.\nTan founded venture capital firm Walden International in 1987. Through the company, he became a seed investor in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest chip foundry.\nTan, who was raised in Singapore, was also the CEO of Cadence Design from 2008 through December 2021, during which the chip design software maker sold products to a Chinese military university believed to be involved in simulating nuclear explosions.\nLast month, Cadence agreed to plead guilty and pay more than US$140 million to resolve the US charges over the sales, which Reuters first reported."

Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation.\"\nAs usual, the president closed with, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"\nAs we previously wrote, the Trump administration called out the country's dependence on overseas suppliers for many of the products we depend on, like semiconductors--referring to it as a \"national security problem\" that Pres. Trump would work to fix:\n.@SecScottBessent: This is a national security problem, which we saw during COVID with our supply chains — and President Trump has decided that we cannot be at risk like that, dependent on foreign countries for our crucial medicines, for semiconductors, for shipping. pic.twitter.com/1XkWcv7qjd\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) April 6, 2025\nSecretary Bessent said: (emphasis added)\nThis has been years in the building. Years in the making. This unsustainable system, our trading partners have taken advantage of us, we can see that through the large surpluses, we see that through the large budget deficit, and also, this is a national security problem which we saw during COVID.

The government will not take a board seat or have other governance rights at Intel.\n...\nThe deal with the Trump administration came together quickly. Mr. Trump had called for Mr. Tan’s resignation in a social media post this month, citing the executive’s ownership stakes in Chinese companies. Days later, Mr. Tan met with Mr. Trump at the White House and discussed giving the U.S. government an equity stake in the chipmaker.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Lutnick and David Zinsner, Intel’s finance chief, reached the framework for an agreement, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. Later that day, Intel’s board blessed the deal, these people said. Mr. Lutnick and Mr. Tan settled the terms on Thursday, a person familiar with the meetings said.\nMr. Tan “walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States,” Mr. Trump said.\nTan said in a statement:\n“We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.\"\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick also spread the word, in an X post that included a photo with himself and the Intel CEO:\nBIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies.\n— Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) August 22, 2025\nThis historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge.\nThanks to Intel… pic.twitter.com/AYMuX14Rgi\nIn the post, Lutnick wrote, \"BIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies.\"\nThe Commerce Secretary continued, \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge.\"\nHe also thanked Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \"for striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"\nThis story is developing.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.\nJoin our WhatsApp groupSubscribe to our Daily Roundup Email\nSpeaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.\n“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,” Trump said. “He agreed, and they’ve agreed to do it.”\nThe official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nWhat’s happening?\nThe Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel’s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world’s largest economy.\nWhy would Trump do this?\nIn his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\nTrump’s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nDidn’t Trump want Intel’s CEO to quit?\nThat’s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan’s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an “amazing story.”\nWhy would Intel do a deal?\nThe company isn’t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.\nIntel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.\nWould this deal be unusual?\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nWould the government run Intel?\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel’s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration’s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company’s chips.\nWhat government grants does Intel receive?\nIntel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn’t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.\nThe company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program — money that Lutnick derided as a “giveaway” that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it’s turned into Intel stock. “We think America should get the benefit of the bar.\npoliticians are never good at running businesses – the 20% loss at gm should have been enough of a warning. the feds couldn’t even make money running a brothel, so the idea of having equity in intel sounds like a fancy package for right-wing ideological fantasies.\nBuy the stock – INTC ?\nWinning"

      "text": "By MICHELLE L. PRICE and MICHAEL LIEDTKE, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday announced the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in struggling Silicon Valley pioneer Intel in a deal that was completed just a couple weeks after he was depicting the company’s CEO as a conflicted leader unfit for the job.\n“The United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote in a post.\nThe U.S. government is getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges. All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — a discount from Friday’s closing price at $24.80. That spread means the U.S. government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper.\nThe remarkable turn of events makes the U.S. government one of Intel’s largest shareholders at a time that the Santa Clara, California, company is i n the process of jettisoning more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to bounce back from years of missteps taken under a variety of CEOs.\nIntel’s current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months, an d earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist. Trump latched on to those concerns in an August 7 post demanding that Tan resign.\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the U.S. government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023. Trump hailed Tan as “highly respected” CEO in his Friday post.\nIn a statement, Tan applauded Trump for “driving historic investments in a vital industry” and resolved to reward his faith in Intel. “We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” Tan said.\nIntel’s current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60% below its peak reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later. The company’s market value currently stands at about $108 billion – a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion.\nThe stake is coming primarily through U.S. government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act that was started under President Joe Biden’s administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips to lessen the dependence on overseas factories.\nBut the Trump administration, which has regularly pilloried the policies of the Biden administration, saw the CHIPs act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to make a profit off the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n“We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. “It’s obvious that it’s the right move to make.”\nAbout $7.8 billion had been been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded so far. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called “Secure Enclave.”\nAlthough U.S. government can’t vote with its shares and won’t have a seat on Intel’s board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could hurt the tech industry in a variety of ways.\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time that he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n“Overall, it’s a horrendous move that will have real harms for U.S. companies, U.S. tech leadership, and the U.S. economy overall,” Lincicome posted Friday.\nThe 10% stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel’s stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating his past successes in business.\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago because of all the challenges facing Intel.\n“I don’t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,” Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel’s business.\n“I don’t care how good of businessman you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government.,” Tengler said.\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nThe U.S. government’s stake in Intel coincides with Trump’s push to bring production to the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nEven before gaining the 10% stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\nLiedtke reported from San Ramon, California."

The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\nTrump’s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nDidn’t Trump want Intel’s CEO to quit?\nThat’s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan’s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an “amazing story.”\nWhy would Intel do a deal?\nThe company isn’t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.\nIntel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.\nWould this deal be unusual?\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nWould the government run Intel?\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel’s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration’s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company’s chips.\nWhat government grants does Intel receive?\nIntel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn’t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.\nThe company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program — money that Lutnick derided as a “giveaway” that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it’s turned into Intel stock. “We think America should get the benefit of the bar"

      "text": "Intel agrees to deal that would give US nearly 10% stake\n(This story was updated to accurately reflect the most current information.)\nPresident Donald Trump said on Aug. 22 that the U.S. would take a nearly 10% stake in Intel under a deal with the struggling chipmaker that converts government grants into an equity share, the latest extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate America.\nThe deal puts Trump on better terms with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, after the president recently said the CEO should step down due to conflicts of interest. It will ensure that the chipmaker will receive about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.\nThe U.S. agreed to purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion at a price of $20.47 a share, which is a discount of about $4 per share from Intel's closing share price of $24.80 on Aug. 22.\nThe government will purchase the 433.3 million shares with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Secure Enclave program, also awarded under Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden.\nIntel stock rose roughly 1% in the extended session on Aug. 22 after closing up 5.5% during regular trading.\n“Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” Tan said in an Aug. 22 statement. “We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.”\nThe development follows a meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and Trump earlier this month that was sparked by Trump's demand for the Intel chief's resignation over his ties to Chinese firms.\n\"He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States,\" Trump said Aug. 22.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an Intel news release: “As more companies look to invest in America, this administration remains committed to reinforcing our country’s dominance in artificial intelligence while strengthening our national security.”\nThe move also follows a $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank Group in what was a major vote of confidence for the troubled U.S. chipmaker in the middle of a turnaround.\nFederal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive its loss-making foundry business, analysts said, but it still suffers from a weak product roadmap and challenges in attracting customers to its new factories.\nThe company is spending $28 billion on a pair of semiconductor fabs in Licking County, Ohio. The project has faced repeated delays from an initially aggressive timeline.\nIntel discussion part of unprecedented Trump moves\nTrump, who met with Tan on Aug. 11, has taken an unprecedented approach to national security.\nThe U.S. president has pushed for multibillion-dollar government tie-ups in semiconductors and rare earths, such as a pay-for-play deal with Nvidia and an arrangement with rare-earth producer MP Materials, to secure criticalminerals.\nTan, who took the top job at Intel in March, has been tasked to turn around the American chipmaking icon, which recorded an annual loss of $18.8 billion in 2024 — its first such loss since 1986. The company's last fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021.\nOhio senators express support for federal stake in Intel\nTrump's comments come as Ohio's two senators this week said they would consider supporting the administration taking a stake in the chipmaker.\nSen. Jon Husted showed support for a federal stake in Intel in a string of posts Aug. 21 on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\"A federal ownership stake in Intel might make sense for taxpayers,\" Husted posted. \"Either way, two issues remain: lowering production costs and ensuring strong customer demand.\"\nRepublican Sen. Bernie Moreno, who has called for more scrutiny of how Intel has spent government funding, also said this week that he would support the administration taking a stake in Intel. Moreno said having the government take a stake in Intel was \"common sense,\" and he said he wouldn't consider it a bailout.\n\"The U.S. taxpayer said, 'Hey, we're going to give you the money, here you go, make semiconductors in America,'\" Moreno said at the City Club of Cleveland. \"What's happened? The facility's sitting there. It's a big gigantic construction site. It's not producing anything.\"\nIntel's Ohio factories delayed amid financial troubles\nIntel's first Ohio microchip plant was originally slated to open in New Albany in 2025. But, the company's finances have forced it to delay the first factory opening to 2030 or 2031.\nIn July, Intel announced it would \"further slow\" the pace of construction on its Ohio factories. It was unclear at the time how the latest slowdown would impact the company's timeline for its Ohio One campus.\nAmong the construction expected to continue is pouring concrete for the fabs and support buildings, steel work and groundworks for support structures. Intel expects to spend more than $1 billion on the project in 2025 alone.\nIn preparation for its promised $28 billion factories, Intel has already started hiring Ohioans and training them at pre-existing company facilities in Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon.\nIntel's Ohio factories are part of a larger effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, a move that experts and government leaders have said is critical to national security.\nThe company was awarded $7.865 billion in funding as part of the federal CHIPS Incentives Program. At least $1.5 billion of that funding was set to go toward the New Albany project, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. An agreement between Intel and the Ohio Department of Development offered the company $300 million in grants to help with the construction of each factory, as long as they were completed by the end of 2028.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru and David Shepardson, Andrea Shalal and Nandita Bose in Washington, additional reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City and Max A.

All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — a discount from Friday’s closing price at $24.80.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday announced the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in struggling Silicon Valley pioneer Intel in a deal that was completed just a couple weeks after he was depicting the company's CEO as a conflicted leader unfit for the job.\n“The United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote in a post.\nThe U.S. government is getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges. All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece — a discount from Friday's closing price at $24.80. That spread means the U.S. government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper.\nThe remarkable turn of events makes the U.S. government one of Intel's largest shareholders at a time that the Santa Clara, California, company is i n the process of jettisoning more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to bounce back from years of missteps taken under a variety of CEOs.\nIntel's current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months, an d earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist. Trump latched on to those concerns in an August 7 post demanding that Tan resign.\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the U.S. government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023. Trump hailed Tan as “highly respected” CEO in his Friday post.\nIn a statement, Tan applauded Trump for “driving historic investments in a vital industry” and resolved to reward his faith in Intel. “We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” Tan said.\nIntel's current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60% below its peak of about $75 reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later. The company's market value currently stands at about $108 billion - a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion.\nThe stake is coming primarily through U.S. government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act that was started under President Joe Biden's administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips to lessen the dependence on overseas factories.\nBut the Trump administration, which has regularly pilloried the policies of the Biden administration, saw the CHIPs act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to make a profit off the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n\"We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. “It’s obvious that it’s the right move to make.”\nAbout $7.8 billion had been been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded so far. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called “Secure Enclave.”\nAlthough U.S. government can't vote with its shares and won't have a seat on Intel's board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could hurt the tech industry in a variety of ways.\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time that he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n“Overall, it’s a horrendous move that will have real harms for U.S. companies, U.S. tech leadership, and the U.S. economy overall,” Lincicome posted Friday.\nThe 10% stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel's stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating his past successes in business.\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago because of all the challenges facing Intel.\n“I don’t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,” Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel's business.\n“I don’t care how good of businessman you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government.,” Tengler said.\nAlthough rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\nThe U.S. government's stake in Intel coincides with Trump's push to bring production to the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\nEven before gaining the 10% stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.\n—-\nLiedtke reported from San Ramon, California."

The president has pointed to the need to compete with companies like Nvidia, which has gained a dominant position in the AI chip market.\nThe announcement marks a significant reversal from just weeks ago, when President Trump demanded the resignation of Intel’s CEO on August 7.

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday said Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the U.S. the beleaguered chipmaker’s third-largest shareholder in one of the largest government interventions in an American company in more than a decade.\nKey Facts\nTrump said the agreement, representing a 10% stake work roughly $10 billion, resulted from his meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan last week, telling reporters Friday, “I said, ‘I think it would be good having the United States as your partner.’”\nThe deal will likely require approval from Intel’s board of directors.\nA 10% stake would represent the third-largest institutional holding in Intel, behind 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard.\nAn agreement—expected to be formally announced later Friday—would boost Intel, which has been “left behind” its competitors in the chipmaking industry, Trump said.\nShares of Intel rose more than 6% to just below $24 after Trump announced the agreement.\nSurprising Fact\nEarlier this month, Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and said he should resign “immediately,” after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Intel’s board over his alleged ties to Chinese firms. Cotton asked whether Tan divested from Chinese companies linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party, and whether Intel’s board was aware of a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan served as CEO before being hired at Intel in March. Tan disputed the claims in a memo to Intel employees, writing there was “a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles” and arguing he has “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” Trump’s opinion on Tan changed after meeting in the White House last week, when Trump lauded Tan as “an amazing story.”\nTangent\nA 10% stake would rank the U.S. just above SoftBank, which announced earlier this week it would invest $2 billion in Intel as part of both firms “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S. The investment represents a roughly 2% stake, ranking SoftBank the fifth-largest shareholder of Intel.\nKey Background\nAn investment by the U.S. in Intel developed over the last week, as Trump administration officials reportedly discussed converting grants under the CHIPS Act into an equity stake. Such a partial ownership in a U.S.-based company is historically rare, though the federal government previously injected billions of funds into Chrysler and General Motors to help restore the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis. In the early 20th century, the U.S. provided financial support through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was created by President Franklin Roosevelt to stabilize struggling banks, railroads and other firms during the Great Depression. The Treasury Department also provided loans through the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the U.S. took up rights to buy stock in airlines like Delta, United and Southwest."

      "text": "The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating to turn Intel’s $10.9 billion CHIPS Act subsidies into a 10 percent equity stake in the company. If finalized, Washington would be among Intel’s largest shareholders.\nThat should set off alarm bells for anyone who still believes in free markets. A conservative administration that came to power promising deregulation and opportunity is now taking steps that blur the line between capitalism and state management of industry.\nThis move is part of a larger pattern.\nEarlier this year, the Pentagon took a preferred equity position in MP Materials, the country’s largest rare-earth mining firm, effectively giving the government direct financial leverage over a critical supply chain. After Nippon Steel’s bid for U.S. Steel, the administration negotiated a “golden share” in the company, giving Washington veto power over decisions ranging from executive pay to plant closures.\nAbroad, Trump officials have reportedly floated proposals that would grant the US government direct payments from foreign resource revenues in exchange for trade or security guarantees.\nSome conservatives defend these arrangements as “strategic.” They argue that America cannot afford to rely on foreign suppliers for semiconductors, rare earths, or steel. National security, they insist, justifies extraordinary measures.\nBut once government crosses the line into equity ownership, the game changes. It’s no longer about setting fair rules of the road—it’s about Washington joining the race as a participant. That undermines competition, politicizes corporate decisions, and exposes taxpayers to risks they never agreed to take.\nEconomics 101: What’s Wrong With Equity Stakes\nThe first lesson comes from opportunity cost. Every dollar the government spends buying shares is a dollar it cannot use to reduce taxes, retire debt, or provide genuinely public goods.\nThe resources are scarce, and putting them into Intel stock means less available for other, possibly more valuable, uses. Economists from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman have warned that when governments redirect capital for political reasons, the result is misallocation.\nThe second lesson is about incentives. Private investors demand efficiency because their money is on the line. Government officials, by contrast, make decisions based on politics. If Intel falters, will Washington push for restructuring and accountability—or will politicians double down to save face? History suggests the latter.\nFrom Amtrak to Solyndra, government ownership often locks in inefficiency rather than driving improvement.\nThe third lesson concerns public choice economics. Once government owns part of a firm, special interests swarm. Lobbyists push for favorable regulation, subsidies, and procurement contracts that tilt the playing field. This breeds cronyism—where success depends on political access instead of innovation.\nThomas Sowell put it plainly: “The first lesson of economics is scarcity. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.”\nGovernment-as-investor is the embodiment of that tension.\nLessons From History\nThis kind of industrial policy is not new. Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) famously tried to steer the country’s industries in the 1980s, funneling state resources to “strategic sectors.” Yet the results were mixed at best. Japanese chipmakers, once dominant, fell behind precisely because competition gave way to cozy relationships with bureaucrats.\nCloser to home, the federal government nationalized passenger rail with Amtrak in 1971, promising efficiency and profitability. Fifty years later, Amtrak still relies on billions in subsidies and remains unable to compete with private alternatives where they exist.\nSimilarly, the 2009 federal bailout of GM and Chrysler made taxpayers temporary shareholders. The firms survived, but at the cost of distorting the bankruptcy process and politicizing capital allocation.\nThese examples show that once government enters the boardroom, it rarely leaves.\nWhy Conservatives Should Worry\nPerhaps the most troubling aspect of the Intel stake is not economic but political. Conservatives long criticized Democrats for pursuing industrial policy through the CHIPS and Science Act. Yet now, under Republican leadership, we see the same tactics—only bigger.\nIf the right normalizes government equity stakes in the name of security, they will have no credibility left to oppose similar measures when the left expands them to other industries.\nThis is a bait-and-switch for the conservative movement. Tax cuts and deregulation were supposed to unleash private enterprise. Instead, Washington is embracing what can only be called corporate socialism—profits privatized, losses socialized, and taxpayers held hostage to the fortunes of politically connected firms.\nA Better Path Forward\nNational security threats can happen, but equity ownership is the wrong response. Instead, policymakers should focus on conditions that encourage all firms to invest and innovate in the United States:\n- Broad-based tax reform that lowers rates and removes carveouts.\n- Regulatory streamlining that shortens permitting timelines and reduces red tape for manufacturing and energy projects.\n- Sound money that preserves purchasing power and reduces uncertainty for investors.\n- Rule of law and strong property rights, ensuring businesses know their assets won’t be subject to political manipulation.\n- Spending restraint that limits government growth to the pace of population plus inflation, freeing up resources for the private sector. Cutting spending is not just fiscally responsible; it’s the only way to ensure the government cannot continue to expand its role as the investor of last resort.\nIf Intel or any other company cannot survive without a government equity injection, then it may not deserve to survive. That is how markets work: failure clears the way for success. Shielding firms from discipline delays the very innovation policymakers claim to seek.\nConclusion\nThe Trump administration’s Intel play is more than a one-off—it’s a signal of a broader shift. By taking equity stakes in private firms, the government ceases to be a referee and becomes a competitor. That distorts markets, undermines incentives, and saddles taxpayers with risks.\nThe lesson from Economics 101 is timeless: scarce resources must be allocated by markets, not ministries. The role of government is to set clear, neutral rules—not to hold stock certificates. If conservatives abandon that principle, they hand their opponents the blueprint for permanent industrial policy.\nAmerica doesn’t need Washington in the boardroom. It needs Washington to cut spending, balance the books, and let markets do what they do best: allocate capital, reward innovation, and drive prosperity.\nIntel’s future should be decided in the marketplace—not in the halls of the Treasury.\nShare This Article\nPost on Facebook\nPost on X\nPrint Article\nEmail Article"

      "text": "Trump Locks In 10% Intel Stake\nThe Trump administration has now struck a deal to take a 9.9% stake in Intel by converting outstanding federal grants into equity rather than injecting fresh capital.\nUnder the agreement, Washington will acquire 433.3 million Intel shares at US$20.47 (US$32.10) apiece, worth about US$8.9 billion (A$14.0 billion).\nThe money is coming from US$5.7 billion (A$8.9 billion) in unpaid CHIPS Act awards and $3.2 billion (A$5 billion) from the Secure Enclave defense program.\nIntel shares closed 5.5% higher at $24.80 after the announcement.\nAs Channel News noted mid-last week, Intel’s share price had already surged 28% during August, as it became increasingly likely the company was going to be backed, in some form, by the US Government.\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan met President Trump a couple of weeks ago, shortly after Trump demanded his resignation over alleged ties to China.\nOn Friday, Trump boasted: “He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion”.\nTrump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick tweeted that the deal was “fair to Intel and fair to the American People”.\nFor its part, the troubled chipmaker stressed the deal lets taxpayers buy stock at a discount “while enabling the US and existing shareholders to benefit from Intel’s long-term business success”.\nThe US government will not take a board seat. It has agreed to lift the CHIPS Act guardrails that restricted share buybacks.\nA five-year warrant also gives Washington the option to lift its stake to 15% if Intel loses majority control of its foundry business.\nThe move comes as Intel struggles to close the gap with TSMC and Samsung in chip fabrication technology.\nThe company posted a $3.2 billion operating loss in Q2 from soaring fab costs. It has cancelled planned plants in Germany and Poland and delayed projects in Ohio.\nSoftBank has also now pledged a separate $2 billion investment in the company.\nAs the only U.S. chipmaker still pursuing leading-edge logic R&D, Intel insists it remains critical to American tech sovereignty.\nReaction to the hotly anticipated, if unconventional, private-public partnership has been cautious.\nWhen the plan was first floated, rival chipmakers warned that government ownership risked tilting the playing field in Intel’s favour.\nSome media outlets, echoing fears in Washington, have warned the deal could have foreign governments retaliating by offering financial support – or even more financial support, as the case may be – to their own ‘national champion’ tech companies.\nWhatever happens, the deal underscores how the US government is increasingly willing to move from just subsidising companies to part-owning them.\nEven in the spiritual home of capitalism, the lines between free enterprise and state-backed competition are now growing blurry."

      "text": "WASHINGTON – In a bold move to bolster U.S. semiconductor dominance, the Trump administration has acquired a 9.9% stake in Intel Corporation for $8.9 billion, announced on August 22, 2025, marking one of the largest government interventions in a private U.S. company since the 2008 auto industry bailout.\nThe deal, converting grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and Secure Enclave program into equity, aims to secure Intel’s role in national security and economic competitiveness, per The New York Times. With President Donald Trump hailing it as a “great deal for America,” the investment follows intense negotiations with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and raises questions about government influence in corporate America. Here’s the latest on this historic agreement, its implications, and Intel’s path forward.\nDetails of the Intel Deal\nThe Trump administration’s $8.9 billion investment secures 433.3 million shares of Intel common stock at $20.47 per share, a discount from the $24.80 closing price on August 22, 2025, per Intel Newsroom. The funding comprises $5.7 billion in unpaid CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion from the Defense Department’s Secure Enclave program, building on $2.2 billion already received, totaling $11.1 billion, per NPR.\nThe government’s stake is passive, with no board representation or governance rights, and it agrees to vote with Intel’s board on shareholder matters, with limited exceptions, per Intel Newsroom. A five-year warrant for an additional 5% of shares at $20 is exercisable if Intel loses majority control of its foundry business, per CNN Business.\nPresident Trump announced the deal on Truth Social, stating, “It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” per PBS News. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed this, posting on X, “BIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,” per CNBC. The deal, finalized after a White House meeting with Tan on August 11, 2025, follows Trump’s earlier call for Tan’s resignation over alleged China ties, a stance he later softened, per The Guardian.\nStrategic Context: Why Intel?\nIntel, the only U.S. company capable of producing advanced chips domestically, is critical to national security and economic goals, per Fox Business. Semiconductors power everything from smartphones to defense systems, and Intel’s struggles—reporting an $18.8 billion loss in 2024—have raised concerns about U.S. reliance on foreign chipmakers like Taiwan’s TSMC, per Reuters.\nThe CHIPS Act, signed in 2022, allocated $53 billion to revive U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, with Intel receiving $10.86 billion in grants, including $7.86 billion for projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and $3 billion for Defense Department chips, per The New York Times.\nThe Trump administration, critical of the CHIPS Act as a “giveaway,” converted these grants into equity to ensure taxpayer returns, per NBC News. Trump’s broader semiconductor strategy includes 100% tariffs on foreign chips to incentivize domestic production, as seen in deals with Nvidia and AMD, which pay 15% of China chip sale revenues for export licenses, per CNN Business. The Intel investment aligns with plans to accelerate its Ohio factory hub, delayed due to funding and demand uncertainties, per Bloomberg.\nIntel’s Challenges and Turnaround Efforts\nIntel has faced significant hurdles, losing market share to Nvidia and AMD in AI chips and struggling to attract customers for its foundry business, per Reuters. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, appointed in March 2025, is tasked with a turnaround, cutting 15% of staff (over 20,000 jobs) and pausing projects in Germany and Poland, per CNBC. The Ohio factory, intended to be the world’s largest chipmaking facility, faces delays, with analysts questioning demand for its chips, per NPR. A $2 billion investment from SoftBank, announced August 19, 2025, complements the government’s stake, signaling confidence in Intel’s recovery, per The New York Times.\nTan emphasized Intel’s commitment, stating, “As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” per Intel Newsroom. However, analysts like Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies warn that the government stake may not address Intel’s core issue: producing competitive chips that attract customers like Apple or Nvidia, per The New York Times.\nImplications and Criticisms\nThe deal has sparked debate. Supporters, including Trump and Lutnick, argue it strengthens U.S. technological leadership and protects national security, per Fox Business. Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy told Fox Business, “Given the national security implications of having a domestic foundry… it would not surprise me if one of the options on the table is an investment in Intel,” per Fox Business. Intel’s stock rose 5.5% on August 22, reflecting investor optimism, per Reuters.\nCritics, however, see risks in government overreach. Nancy Tengler of Laffer Tengler Investments told PBS News, “I don’t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,” warning of potential meddling, per PBS News. A 2003 congressional study cited by NBC News cautioned that government stakes expose taxpayers to risk without guaranteed returns, per NBC News.\nFuture Outlook\nThe investment provides Intel with capital to stabilize its foundry business and Ohio projects, but its success hinges on attracting customers for its 14A and 18A manufacturing processes, per Reuters. Trump’s administration is exploring similar stakes in other critical industries, signaling a shift toward direct industrial policy, per CNN Business. Analysts like Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights argue that without major clients, “no government investment will change the fate of its foundry arm,” per Reuters.\nAs Intel navigates its turnaround, the government’s role as a major shareholder—valued at approximately $10 billion based on Intel’s $108 billion market cap—could reshape perceptions of the company as “too big to fail,” per The New York Times. Whether this deal catalyzes Intel’s revival or becomes a cautionary tale of government intervention remains to be seen.\nConclusion\nThe Trump administration’s $8.9 billion investment for a 9.9% stake in Intel, announced August 22, 2025, marks a historic shift in U.S. industrial policy, leveraging CHIPS Act and Secure Enclave funds to bolster domestic chipmaking.\nAimed at securing Intel’s role in national security and economic competitiveness, the deal follows intense negotiations with CEO Lip-Bu Tan and aligns with Trump’s tariff-driven push for U.S. manufacturing, per NPR. While supporters see it as a strategic win, critics warn of risks to taxpayers and corporate autonomy, per PBS News. As Intel battles to regain its edge, this unprecedented government partnership could redefine the U.S. tech landscape in 2025 and beyond."

So we picked up US$10 billion,\" Trump said.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that Tan had struck a deal \"that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"\nThe Intel investment marks the latest unusual deal with US companies, including a US government agreement allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for receiving 15 percent of those sales.\nOther recent deals include an agreement for the Pentagon to become the largest shareholder in a small mining company, MP Materials, to boost output of rare earth magnets and the US government's winning a \"golden share\" with certain veto rights as part of a deal to allow Japan's Nippon Steel to buy US Steel.\nThe US government's broad intervention in corporate matters has worried critics, who say Trump's actions create new categories of corporate risk.\nAhead of the US deal with Intel, Japan's SoftBank agreed to take a US$2 billion stake in the chip maker.\nSome industry observers still question Intel's ability to surmount its problems.\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said Intel's problems are beyond a cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government, singling out Intel's contract chip manufacturing business, known as its foundry unit.\n\"Without government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be difficult for the Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,\" he said.\nIntel \"needs to catch up with TSMC from a technological perspective to attract business,\" he added.\nThe US government's stake is to be passive ownership and does not include a board seat, Intel said.\nIt will be required to vote with Intel's board when shareholder approval is necessary, with \"limited exceptions.\" Intel did not specify the exceptions.\nThe equity stake also includes a five-year warrant at US$20 a share for an additional five percent of Intel stock, which the US can use if Intel loses control of the foundry business.\nFederal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive its loss-making foundry business, analysts said, but it ceded the AI market to Nvidia and has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices in its central processor business for several years. It has also faced challenges in attracting customers to its new factories.\nTan, who became CEO in March, has been tasked to turn around the American chipmaking icon, which recorded an annual loss of US$18.8 billion in 2024 - its first such loss since 1986. The company's last fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021."

      "text": "US buys Intel stake with Chips Act cash\nCette publication existe aussi en Français\nThe US government has bought a 9.9% stake in chip maker Intel using cash from its Chips Act.\nThe deal, cited as ‘historic’ comes after the Trump administration called for Intel CEO Lip-Tan Bu to step down over his links to China through his venture capital fund, Walden International.\nThe purchase of 433m shares cost the US government $8.9bn and will be funded by the remaining $5.7bn in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2bn awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave programme.\nThe Chips Act cash was being used for the development of fabs in Ohio that have since been put on hold. The existing claw-back and profit-sharing provisions associated with the government’s previously dispersed $2.2 billion grant to Intel under the CHIPS Act will be eliminated.\n- US trims Inte’s Chips Act funding\n- Trump to delay, cut Chips Act funds\n- The European Chips Act has no clothes\nAlthough the Trump administration says it does not plan to put a member on the board of directors, the stake will give the US government more direct say in the direction and strategy of the company. This is particularly important as Intel has looked at selling off its fabs in its separate foundry business and is a major customer of Taiwanese foundry TSMC\nA key example of this influence is that the deal also includes a five-year warrant, at $20 per share for an additional five percent of Intel common shares, if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of the foundry business.\n“Intel is excited to welcome the United States of America as a shareholder, helping to create the most advanced chips in the world,” said Howard Lutnick, United States Secretary of Commerce. “As more companies look to invest in America, this administration remains committed to reinforcing our country’s dominance in artificial intelligence while strengthening our national security.”\nThe deal was backed by major Intel customers, including Microsoft, Dell, HP and Amazon Web Services.\n“As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security. We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.”\n“The industry needs a strong and resilient U.S. semiconductor industry, and no company is more important to this mission than Intel. It’s great to see Intel and the Trump Administration working together to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” said Michael Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dell Technologies\nPJT Partners acted as Intel’s exclusive financial advisor in connection with this investment agreement.\nwww.intel.com"

      "text": "Heather Cox Richardson details the history of the Modern Conservative movement, begun with Reagan, courting racist and misogynistic constituents, became Trump2025 fascist Regime.\n“It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” President Donald Trump wrote yesterday afternoon on social media. He took the stake in the company after calling on August 7 for its chief executive officer, Lip-Bu Tan, to step down. When Tan met with Trump on August 11, the president says, he told Tan the U.S. “should be given 10% of Intel.” Tan agreed. Announcing the deal, Trump referred to Tan as “the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company.”\nIt is wild to see Republicans cheering on a president who publicly threatened a CEO and stated openly that he shook the man down for a major share in his company.\nIt is even wilder to see Republicans, who since 1980 have held so fervently to the idea of free markets that they have denounced even the most basic regulations as socialism, celebrate the government takeover of a private company.\nThe story of that shift is a larger story about how the Republicans came to put party over country and, now, how they have put power over everything.\nIt was not always this way.\nAfter World War II, leaders of both major political parties agreed that the government should regulate business, provide a basic social safety net, promote infrastructure, protect civil rights, and shore up a rules-based international order to try to prevent another world war. Republicans and Democrats contended, sometimes bitterly, over policies, but members of both parties recognized that they shared with the other a loyalty to the country and a general set of beliefs about what was best for it that encouraged them to seek common ground.\nAs recently as 1974, Republican senators went to the White House to tell a member of their own party that the House of Representatives would vote to impeach him for covering up a break-in at the headquarters of the Democratic Party and that they would vote to convict him. After their visit, President Richard M. Nixon resigned.\nBut 1980 saw the takeover of the Republican Party by an extremist faction known as the “Movement Conservatives.” Their roots lay in 1937, when men who hated the New Deal legislation being put in place by the Democrats came together to destroy it. Businessmen who hated business regulations and taxes joined with southern racists who hated Black rights and with religious traditionalists who hated women’s rights and wanted the churches to control welfare programs so they could police behavior.\nCalling themselves “conservatives” because they wanted to dismantle the laws and recreate the 1920s, the Movement Conservatives produced a list of demands. They called for deregulation, tax cuts, an end to social welfare spending, and an end to government support for workers, maintaining that those principles would protect the bedrock of the economy: private enterprise. They also called for states’ rights, home rule, and local self-government, by which they meant that southern states could maintain discriminatory laws against their citizens, no matter what the Fourteenth Amendment said.\nTheir goal was not to compromise with Democrats or Republicans who believed in an active government; their goal was to destroy that government. They insisted that government regulations and taxes were creeping socialism; they said that social welfare sapped American individualism; they said that civil rights laws destroyed democracy by overruling state voters. Most Americans wanted little to do with this faction until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that protected Black and Brown voting enabled the businessmen who hated regulation and taxes to mobilize racists.\nRonald Reagan tapped into the Movement Conservatives in 1964, when he backed Arizona senator Barry Goldwater for the presidency. When he ran for the presidency in 1980, his promises focused on economic freedom, but the racism and sexism in the radical faction was always present; he deliberately appealed to racists with a promise to defend states’ rights and to the sexists trying to combat the women’s liberation movement with an appeal to religious traditionalists. Reagan promised to put businessmen in the driver’s seat, but he depended on the votes of racists and sexists to win the White House.\nReagan’s tax cuts tripled the federal debt and left his successor, George H.W. Bush, facing a $171 billion deficit in 1990, along with the threat of automatic cuts of 40% across the board if the deficit wasn’t reduced. Bush reneged on his promise not to raise taxes. Movement Conservatives signed on in private, but in public they attacked the deal as a betrayal of Reaganism and common people. Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich used the opportunity to purge the Republican Party of its traditional base: those who believed in an active government. He accused anyone who stood against him of being a “Republican In Name Only,” or “RINO.”\nIn 1994, Gingrich managed to flip the House of Representatives to the Republicans for the first time since 1954, and he set out to reshape the Republican Party into an instrument for destroying the modern government. That effort would require destroying the Democratic Party by referring to its members as “corrupt,” “intolerant,” “sick,” “traitors”; by launching investigations of what he insisted—without evidence—was “voter fraud,” and by investigating and then impeaching Democratic president Bill Clinton.\nBy the end of the 1990s, leading Republicans no longer saw party differences as differences of policy. Party trumped country because they believed they were in a fight for the soul of America, and they were on the side of the angels.\nIf keeping Democrats out of power meant it was necessary to skew the system, surely that was justified. Republicans began to talk of purifying the voter rolls in the 1990s, and in 1998 the Florida legislature passed a law that purged from the system as many as 100,000 Black voters presumed to be Democrats. This purge paid off in 2000, when Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore won the popular vote by more than half a million votes but was four votes short of a win in the Electoral College. The contest came down to Florida, where a confusing ballot had siphoned about 10,000 votes intended for Gore off to far-right candidate Pat Buchanan.\nA hand recount had reduced Republican candidate George W. Bush’s lead from 1,784 to 537 when Republican operatives attacked the recount venue in Miami-Dade County to stop the recount, claiming there was “voter fraud.” The Supreme Court—led by five Republican-appointed justices—stepped in to give the victory to Bush.\nWhen voters elected Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, Republicans declared war. On the night of Obama’s inauguration, Republican senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other Republican leaders agreed over dinner to oppose anything that the new president proposed, regardless of whether they agreed with it. “For the next two years, we can’t let you succeed in anything. That’s our ticket to coming back,” Republican senators told incoming vice president Joe Biden.\nThey also worked to make it easier for Republicans to win. In 2010 the Supreme Court overturned a century of campaign finance laws to permit unlimited corporate and other outside money to flow into elections.\nAt the same time, Republican operatives launched Operation REDMAP, or Redistricting Majority Project, to take over statehouses before the redistricting after the 2010 census. They won the statehouses of Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Ohio, and Michigan, as well as other, smaller states, and they redrew congressional maps using precise computer models. In the 2012 election, Democrats won the White House decisively, the Senate easily, and a majority of 1.4 million votes for House candidates. And yet Republicans came away with a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives.\nThree years later, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act by ending the requirement that states with a history of racial discrimination in voting preclear changes to their voting rules with the Department of Justice. Republican-dominated state legislatures immediately began to restrict voting rights.\nBut the Republican economic program of slashing regulations and taxes was never popular, and the Republicans stayed in power by doubling down on the racism and sexism of their voting base. After 1987, talk radio fed the rhetoric that racial minorities and women were ushering socialism into the United States, and after 1994 the Fox News Channel amplified it.\nIn 2016, Donald Trump rode to the White House by playing directly to that racism and sexism and asserting that white men should dominate women and people of color. Establishment leaders backed him for the tax cuts he promised, but they no longer called the shots. The racist and sexist MAGA base did. Trump and his loyalists took the idea that they had a right to rule to its logical extreme. When voters elected Democrat Joe Biden to the presidency, they tried to overturn that election with violence.\nNow, back in office, Trump is dismantling the government as Movement Conservatives have wanted for decades. But he has abandoned the small-government principles Movement Conservatives claimed to champion and is using state power to terrorize citizens. He has abandoned the due process of the law and states’ rights and is working to rig the system permanently in his favor. And now he has abandoned the free-market principles around which the Movement Conservatives organized in the first place.\nFrom the beginning, “Movement Conservatism” was anything but conservative. Its supporters embraced the radical goal of dismantling a practical system that stabilized the country after the Great Depression and a devastating world war, a system that was based in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. But now they are embracing something altogether different.\nRight-wing activist Christopher Rufo explained yesterday on social media that “a new conservatism has emerged. We are leading a rebellion against the establishment and dismantling the elements of the left-wing ideological regime—not for the purpose of nihilism, but for the purpose of rebirth, or restoration, of our republic.”\nRufo’s statement is, as one commenter noted, “just textbook 1930s fascism.”\n—\nNotes:\nMichael Grunwald, The New New Deal: The Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era (Simon & Schuster, 2012).

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the administration may seek up to a 10% stake in Intel Corp., arguing that taxpayers deserve financial returns from companies benefiting from government support.\nThis policy shift marks a significant departure from the Biden administration’s approach, which limited subsidies to direct grants without equity requirements. The selective application of equity demands creates different financial conditions for companies receiving similar federal support under the $52.7 billion program designed to boost domestic semiconductor production.\nTSMC, a critical supplier to major technology companies including Apple and Nvidia, has committed to substantial U.S. investments, pledging $100 billion in new funding this spring in addition to $65 billion already allocated to its Arizona fabrication facilities. The Commerce Department awarded TSMC $6.6 billion in subsidies last year to support domestic chip production. According to people familiar with the matter, TSMC executives have privately discussed returning subsidies if forced to relinquish equity stakes.\nMicron Technology, which received $6.2 billion in CHIPS Act funding, expanded its U.S. manufacturing plans in June. Samsung Electronics Co. also received substantial support with $4.75 billion in federal awards. Market reactions reflected the policy announcement, with TSMC shares rising 1.3% to $142.68, Micron slipping 0.4% to $97.45, and Intel adding 0.9% to $40.82 following the news.\nThe differential treatment raises questions about how the administration determines which companies should provide equity returns to taxpayers and which should receive grants without strings attached. With much of the CHIPS Act funding remaining unspent, this policy approach could influence future investment decisions by semiconductor companies considering U.S. expansion projects.\nThis news story relied on content distributed by citybiz.

      "text": "Intel and Trump Administrative Reach Historic Agreement\n“Intel and Trump Administration Reach Historic Agreement to Accelerate American Technology and Manufacturing Leadership,” Intel Newsroom\nSANTA CLARA, Calif.– Intel Corporation today announced an agreement with the Trump Administration to support the continued expansion of American technology and manufacturing leadership. Under terms of the agreement, the United States government will make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\nThe government’s equity stake will be funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program. Intel will continue to deliver on its Secure Enclave obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to delivering trusted and secure semiconductors to the U.S. Department of Defense. The $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants Intel has received to date, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion.\nThis is what the LA Times had to Say:\nThe idea of federal government investments in public corporation stock has never died. It walks among us like a zombie today. The Trump administration talks about taking a 10% ownership stake in the chipmaker Intel and thinks about creating a sovereign wealth fund akin to those established by Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Norway and other countries.\nWhat does history tell us about the virtues of this idea for the United States: There are not any virtues.\nSuch funds “usually reflect the quality of governance of the states that sponsor them,” observed Steven Feldstein and Jodi Vittori of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April. Adding . . .\n“Considering the Trump administration’s self-dealing and erosion of accountability, there is an acute risk that the U.S. SWF could become a source of graft to reward Trump’s friends, coerce political support for his priorities and bring personal enrichment.”\nLeaving aside the quality of governance in Trump’s White House or legislators’ fears of “socialism,” the idea of federal investment in public companies has never found lasting favor on Capitol Hill. It has been almost impossible for lawmakers to overcome the touchy economic, political and philosophical issues.\nA federal fund with the authority to purchase corporate stock would be one of the largest and most potent investors in the market. As I wrote in 2005, when the idea of allowing Social Security to invest its trust fund in equities was under consideration again, the potential for conflicts of interest is inescapable.\nThe government might be a major shareholder in a corporation it was prosecuting for criminal activity. The government might end up on one side of an international issue as a member of a coalition of nations, and on the opposite side as a shareholder.\nIn itself, Trump is like a child who has learned to ride a two-wheeler. He is full of himself in this achievement. Sometime in the future he is going to slip. Take for an example, the taking of the World Cup Soccer Trophy. The winners were left with an imitation for their Club. Resurrecting a recent idea . . .\nA federal fund with the authority to purchase corporate stock would be one of the largest and most potent investors in the market. Writing in 2005 Michael Hiltzik, the idea of allowing Social Security to invest its trust fund in equities was under consideration again. However, the potential for conflicts of interest is inescapable.\nThe government might be a major shareholder in a corporation it was prosecuting for criminal activity. The government might end up on one side of an international issue as a member of a coalition of nations, and on the opposite side as a shareholder.\nIts financial interests might stand in opposition to its social interests: In his 1999 State of the Union message, for example, President Clinton simultaneously threatened to sue the tobacco industry over its threat to public health, and advocated allowing Social Security to invest in all equities — tobacco included.\nIn 1935, Congress had addressed the conundrum by mandating that the Social Security Administration invest its reserves only in U.S. Treasury securities, a rule that exists to this day.\nSocial Security’s would-be reformers periodically revive proposals to shift some of the program’s trust fund — which held more than $2.7 trillion in treasuries at the end of last year — into equities, pointing to their superior long-term returns compared with bonds. But those efforts have never come to fruition.\nThe federal government taking an equity stake in a public company wouldn’t be unprecedented. In 2009, the Obama administration acquired a 60.8% ownership of General Motors in return for almost $50 billion in bailout funds. The government also acquired a smaller stake in Chrysler, which was subsequently sold to Fiat.\nThe government sold the last of its GM holdings in 2013, booking a direct loss of about $10.5 billion. But its bailout has been deemed a success, given that it saved as many as 1.9 million jobs at GM, Chrysler and their suppliers.\nThe auto bailouts were emergency initiatives. They were to stave off what was shaping up as the auto industry’s imminent collapse. Obama made clear that these were temporary measures and the government would sell off its stockholdings as soon as that was practicable. The government abjured any control over GM’s day-to-day operations. However, it did orchestrate the exit of GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner, oversaw the replacement of a majority of its board members, and imposed compensation limits on its top executives.\nThere is more to read in this piece. I am going to stop here though.\nStill, it would be up to Congress to establish the fund and oversee its operations. Will the lawmakers accept their responsibility? If not, Trump’s idea is a dangerous one. “Giving a president who aspires to be a king a potent financial weapon with ill-defined purposes and methods,” Feldstein and Vittori write, “presents a grave risk to American democracy.”\nFor those who continue to think that Biden’s CHIPS Act and Trump’s purchase of Intel common stock are brilliant ideas: “What do Intel, Cisco, IBM, and Boeing have in common? These giants have all shot themselves in the foot and weakened their ability to compete in the market. All four neglected the tradition of investing in technological development and core business innovation, instead opting to bring immediate value to shareholders—through an addiction to share buybacks…It’s no surprise that Intel missed out on the mobile market and is now playing catch-up in the artificial intelligence space. While competitors were focusing on developing disruptive technologies, Intel spent fortunes on stock buybacks.”\nhttps://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/bypn9cdrc\nGrift is bipartisan big business. I mean, who else but a bunch of corrupt politicians would invest in a “high tech” company that has proven itself incapable of bringing a leading edge product to market when it could still be competitive?\n@John,\nPlease point out where anyone here claimed that Biden’s CHIPS Act and Trump’s purchase of Intel common stock are brilliant ideas. Take all the time you need.\nHow quickly they forget!\nTo add insult to injury, it didn’t even buy Biden and the Democrats the election!\n@John,\nI searched the link. The phrase “brilliant idea” appears nowhere. The name Intel appears nowhere. The name Cisco appears nowhere. The name IBM appears nowhere.\nNice try. Do play again sometime."

While it was a long fiasco, the conclusion is that the Trump administration managed to snag a 10% stake at Intel, with different conditions that we have discussed in the department. Now, according to Taiwan Economic Daily, citing Korean sources, it is reported that Samsung is looking for a 'strategic partnership' with US chipmakers such as Intel, in a bid to secure a better trade deal with the Trump administration.\nIt is claimed that Samsung is exploring partnerships with American companies to 'please' the Trump administration and ensure that its regional operations aren't affected by hefty tariffs. It is speculated that if Samsung manages to strike a deal with Intel, it would allow the Korean giant to see an elevated status in the eyes of President Trump, mainly since Intel has become an important factor for the current US administration. While details around how the partnership could pan out are uncertain, we might know how it could turn out.\nIn a previous report, we discussed how Intel is abandoning its pursuit of glass substrates, and in the midst of it, several engineers from the firm are moving to Samsung's Electro-Mechanics division in the US, since the Korean giant sees glass substrates as an essential part of its prospects. More importantly, since Intel is looking to license its glass substrate technology, Samsung could also play a role in this by producing end solutions for Team Blue, ultimately allowing both firms to leverage the packaging technology.\nFor now, Samsung's chances of adopting Intel's processes, such as the 18A, are slim, considering it all depends on how the node works out for Team Blue's internal products like Panther Lake. Moreover, given that the Korean giant is looking to produce up to 2nm nodes at its Taylor facility, there would be a conflict of interest in sourcing chips from Intel. However, a strategic partnership could still help Intel in many ways and allow the South Korean delegation to secure a better deal."

Although these grants were originally structured as non-dilutive, the administration converted them into equity—an unusual but not necessarily unlawful use—so long as it remains within statutory boundaries .\nPrecedents for intervention: While direct government equity stakes in private companies outside of full-scale bailouts are rare, the government has previously taken minority stakes in critical industries under exceptional circumstances (e.g., the GM bailout). Legal experts are closely watching to see if this new model sets a broader precedent.\nWhat Pressure Was Used on Intel's CEO?\nTensions preceded the deal:\nOn August 11, 2025, Trump publicly demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, citing concerns about his ties to Chinese tech firms\nShortly afterward, Tan met with Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the White House.

      "text": "The federal government just made a power play that’s raising eyebrows and stock prices alike. On Friday, the Trump administration dropped a bombshell, announcing a 10% stake in Intel, a move that signals a new era of government involvement in private enterprise. It’s a calculated step, not a reckless gamble, aimed at securing America’s dominance in the semiconductor game.\nAccording to NBC News, this unprecedented deal, valued at roughly $11 billion, positions the U.S. as a key player in Intel’s future amid fierce competition with China in the artificial intelligence sector.\nLet’s rewind a bit—two weeks ago, President Trump publicly pressed Intel’s CEO to step down over alleged ties to China. That raised some serious questions about where loyalties lie in the tech world. Turns out, actions have consequences, and this stake might just be the follow-through.\nTrump didn’t shy away from taking credit, blasting the news on Truth Social with his signature flair. “It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company,” he declared. Well, if that’s not a mic drop, what is?\nBut let’s unpack this “great deal” Trump touts—the U.S. didn’t shell out a dime directly for these shares. Instead, the stake comes from $5.7 billion in grants under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave program, and $2.2 billion already handed over. It’s a clever use of taxpayer-funded programs, though some might wonder if we’re betting too much on one horse.\nIntel, currently valued at $108 billion on the stock market, has been stumbling lately, with shares down 60% from their pandemic highs. The company’s struggles make this government lifeline a double-edged sword—support, yes, but also a tighter grip from Washington. Is this rescue or control?\nHistorically, the federal government stepping into private business like this is rare outside of crisis moments, like the 2008-2009 financial meltdown bailouts. A 2003 Congressional study warned that such stakes aren’t a “free lunch” and expose taxpayers to risks alongside any rewards. This isn’t exactly a comforting precedent when the economy isn’t in freefall.\nTrump’s approach here tosses aside traditional free-market principles, a departure from conservative norms that might make purists squirm. He’s also strong-armed other chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD into paying 15% of certain China sales revenues for export licenses this month. It’s a bold flex of government muscle—patriotism or overreach, you decide.\nThe administration’s goal is clear: boost U.S. control over semiconductor production as part of a broader national security push in the AI arms race. Chips aren’t just tech—they’re the backbone of our future defense and economy. That’s a mission most Americans can get behind, even if the methods raise a few hackles.\nInterestingly, the U.S. won’t seek a seat on Intel’s board and has agreed to vote with the current directors on most shareholder matters, barring a few exceptions. It’s a hands-off stance for now, which might ease concerns about direct meddling. Still, a 10% stake isn’t pocket change—it’s influence.\nAdding to the mix, Japan’s SoftBank recently pumped $2 billion into Intel, signaling international confidence in the company’s role in advanced tech innovation on American soil. That’s a nice vote of support, especially when Intel’s been lagging behind rivals. Maybe this is the shot in the arm they needed.\nEven some Democrats are on board, with Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia stating, “U.S. leadership is critical for both our economy and national security.” That’s a rare bipartisan nod in these polarized times. But does agreement mean it’s the right move, or just shared desperation?\nWarner also cautioned, “Taking an equity stake in Intel may or may not be the right approach, but one thing is clear: allowing cutting-edge chips to flow to China without restraint will erode the value of any investment we make here at home.” He’s not wrong—China’s tech ambitions are a real threat. Yet, government overreach could stifle the very innovation we’re trying to protect.\nFor now, this $11.1 billion stake—equating to a 9.9% share in a $108 billion company—puts America squarely in the driver’s seat of Intel’s trajectory. It’s a gamble on a struggling giant, one that’s fundamental to our tech future. Will it pay off, or are we just doubling down on a risky bet?\nAt the end of the day, Trump’s strategy is a wake-up call to those who thought government and business could stay neatly separated. National security and economic dominance are on the line, and this administration isn’t playing nice with outdated hands-off policies. Let’s hope this bold move chips away at China’s edge without cracking our own foundation."

Instead of disbursing these as grants, the administration is redirecting them into equity, effectively buying shares without committing new taxpayer dollars.\nRoots in Prior Commitments and Political Maneuvering\nThis move builds on allocations made during the Biden-Harris era, where the CHIPS Act aimed to revitalize U.S. semiconductor production amid global supply chain vulnerabilities. Intel, struggling with market share losses to rivals like TSMC and facing internal challenges, welcomed the arrangement as a vote of confidence. President Trump highlighted the deal as a way to ensure American leadership in advanced technologies, tying it to national security imperatives.\nFurther context from The New York Times reveals this as part of a broader pattern of government interventions, reminiscent of state-managed capitalism seen in other nations. Experts note similarities to post-2008 bailouts of the auto industry, where equity stakes were taken in exchange for support. In Intel’s case, the conversion allows the company to access funds while giving the government a direct say in its operations, potentially influencing decisions on R&D and manufacturing.\nImplications for Intel’s Turnaround Efforts\nIntel’s CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, who assumed the role amid controversy over his ties to Chinese firms, praised the agreement in a statement via Intel’s Newsroom. He emphasized the company’s commitment to U.S.-based leading-edge logic production. The equity infusion, totaling $11.1 billion when combined with prior grants, is expected to accelerate factory builds in states like Arizona and Ohio, creating jobs and reducing reliance on foreign chips.\nYet, skeptics question the long-term efficacy. As The Guardian reported, the deal followed Trump’s demand for Tan’s resignation, underscoring the administration’s aggressive stance on tech nationalism. Industry insiders worry that government ownership could stifle innovation or lead to bureaucratic oversight, potentially deterring private investors wary of political entanglements.\nBroader Economic and Geopolitical Ramifications\nThis unprecedented stake marks a shift from grant-based incentives to ownership models, as noted in analysis from CNN Business. It aligns with Trump’s push for reshoring critical technologies, especially in AI and defense applications. With Intel’s stock volatile amid competition, the government’s position could stabilize the firm but also expose taxpayers to market risks if performance falters.\nLooking ahead, this could set a precedent for deals with other tech firms, like potential interventions in U.S. Steel or Nvidia, per insights from The New York Times. For industry leaders, it signals a new era where federal involvement extends beyond subsidies to equity partnerships, reshaping corporate governance in strategic sectors. As debates swirl over the merits of such interventions, the Intel pact underscores the administration’s bet on blending public funds with private enterprise to secure technological dominance."

      "text": "Intel Corp. announced Friday that the U.S. government has agreed to acquire a 10% stake in the company in exchange for $8.9 billion in federal grants. The move, framed as a turning point for the semiconductor industry, underscores Washington’s determination to reclaim technological dominance from overseas rivals.\nThe funding stems from the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which pledged $39 billion to bolster U.S. chipmaking. Of that, $5.7 billion in unpaid CHIPS grants and $3.2 billion from the Biden administration for secure technology contracts with the Department of Defense will be converted into Intel shares. Together with $2.2 billion Intel has already received, the federal government’s total investment in the company rises to $11.1 billion.\nIntel and Washington Align on National Security\n“As the only U.S. company engaged in leading-edge semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, Intel is committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced chips are American-made,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Friday. He credited President Donald Trump’s aggressive push for U.S. manufacturing as the catalyst for a “historic investment.”\nUnder the deal, the government will obtain 433.3 million primary Intel shares at $20.47 apiece, equaling a 9.9% ownership. The stake will be passive—meaning no board seats or governance rights—but symbolically powerful.\nTrump celebrated the agreement on Truth Social, proclaiming the U.S. “fully owns and controls 10% of Intel,” touting the arrangement as “a great deal for America and Intel alike.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed that sentiment, hailing the move as an engine for AI innovation and national defense."

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced that the federal government has acquired a direct 10% stake in semiconductor giant Intel Corporation.\nThe deal, valued at $8.9 billion, has already appreciated to nearly $11 billion, underscoring Washington’s strategic bet on domestic chipmaking.\nTrump emphasized that the acquisition did not come from “direct taxpayer money,” but was instead structured through existing federal funding mechanisms tied to semiconductor incentives. “This is about ensuring America’s future in technology remains American,” the president declared.\nAccording to Commerce Secretary Harold Lotnick, the U.S. purchased 433.3 million Intel shares at $20.47 per share, a discount to the market price, giving the government a 10% equity stake in the company.\nRoughly $5.7 billion of the purchase was financed through CHIPS Act grants.\nAn additional $3.2 billion came from programs focused on secure chip manufacturing.\nThe agreement also grants Washington an option to acquire an additional 5% stake if Intel loses control of its semiconductor manufacturing division.\nIntel welcomed the investment but clarified that the U.S. government will not hold a board seat or governance rights. In its statement, the company underscored its commitment to keeping advanced semiconductor production “Made in America” while moving ahead with plans to construct new fabs in Ohio. However, construction delays mean those facilities may not be operational until 2030.\nThe government’s stake in Intel marks a departure from traditional federal support for industry, which typically relied on subsidies and tax incentives. Lotnick described the approach as a new model of public-private partnership, saying:\n“The United States is no longer content with simply funding companies. We are now securing ownership returns that reflect our national interest.”\nAnalysts note that the move could reshape how Washington engages with strategically vital sectors, particularly those tied to national security and technological supremacy.\nThe deal comes amid heightened competition in the global semiconductor industry. Japan’s SoftBank recently invested $2 billion into chip technologies, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) remains the world’s most crucial supplier, producing chips for Apple, Nvidia, and other tech giants.\nBy taking a direct stake in Intel, the U.S. aims to bolster domestic production and reduce reliance on overseas suppliers, particularly amid growing geopolitical tensions in East Asia.\nThe government has also announced an $8 billion grant under the CHIPS Act, signed into law in 2022, to support Intel’s long-term manufacturing projects. The funding is intended to accelerate R&D in advanced nodes and secure supply chains critical to defense and civilian applications."

      "bias": "unknown",
      "text": "Key Takeaways:\n- The U.S. government may own a 10% Intel stake.\n- Critics warn politics could guide Intel’s decisions.\n- Some call this state capitalism or socialism.\n- Experts fear this hurts Intel’s competitors.\n- Conservatives say this move clashes with free markets.\nWhat Is the Intel Stake About?\nPresident Trump announced that Intel’s CEO agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% share. As a result, the government would become Intel’s largest investor. Trump pitched this as boosting chipmaking at home. Yet, many worry the move will bring politics into business. After all, the government usually does not hold big shares in private tech firms.\nWhy the Intel Stake Worries Experts\nFirst, some fear politics will drive Intel instead of market demand. A top libertarian scholar warned that government goals may override product quality. He even joked that a chip plant in Ohio might stay unfinished. Moreover, he argued rivals could suffer since the U.S. appears to pick winners and losers.\nSecond, Intel does more than make chips. It runs cloud services, software, and other tech units. Consequently, Washington could intervene in many areas. That raises concerns about global deals too. If Intel ships parts abroad, politics may slow those contracts.\nThird, a former top labor official called this a power grab. He said it is not about helping workers or security. Instead, he claimed Trump wants more control over industry. Critics added that this looks like socialism, not small-government policy.\nFourth, even conservative writers found irony here. One noted Trump often mocks socialist Democrats. Now he pushes what looks like partial nationalization of Intel. Another pointed out that free-market think tanks stayed silent on this big move.\nHow This Move Clashes with Free Market Ideas\nTraditionally, conservatives favor limited government in business. They believe market forces should set prices and guide growth. Yet, by taking a big stake in Intel, the government steps into boardroom decisions. This raises questions about fairness. After all, other chip makers remain purely private. Can they compete when one firm has state backing?\nFurthermore, investors value companies for profit, not politics. If Washington owns a chunk of Intel, some worry profit motive may shrink. In turn, research and development could slow. Competitors may suffer from unequal ground. Hence, business leaders warn that this deal may stifle innovation.\nPolitical Reactions and Labels\nMany voices joined the debate. A former Watergate prosecutor called this a “government takeover.” She highlighted the irony: Trump often labels Democrats as communists. Yet linking state funds to private industry echoes old communist tactics.\nA senator who once championed limited government asked a blunt question. He said, “If government owning production is socialism, is this a step toward it?” His point hit home for many free-market conservatives.\nMeanwhile, a local firefighter running for office exclaimed that this was “literally communism.” His dramatic tone showed how heated the discussion grew. Others left sarcastic comments, mocking the idea of a “small government conservative” who backs big state moves.\nPotential Benefits and Drawbacks\nOn one hand, advocates say more government support could speed up chip production. They argue this move may secure supply chains and boost national security. After all, chips power cars, phones, and military gear. A steady domestic supply matters.\nOn the other hand, critics stress risks to Intel’s long-term health. They fear political pressure could hamper product decisions. In addition, government ties might scare away private investors. As a result, Intel could lose its edge in a fast-moving market.\nIn addition, global partners may view Intel differently. Seeing Washington as a key owner could raise trust issues abroad. Companies in Europe or Asia might avoid deals over political concerns.\nWhat Comes Next?\nFor now, Congress and Intel’s board must approve the deal. If they do, the U.S. will hold a major stake. Then, we will see if politics seeps into Intel’s plans. Ultimately, this experiment may reshape how the government interacts with tech giants. It may also redefine what many call “state capitalism.”\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat does a 10% Intel stake mean for the public?\nA 10% stake means the government will own one in ten Intel shares. This gives Washington voting power in company decisions. It also ties Intel’s future to political goals.\nCould this deal speed up chip production?\nPossibly. More funding and state support might help complete factories faster. Yet, political rules could slow some projects or limit partnerships.\nHow might competitors react?\nCompetitors may feel the playing field tilts toward Intel. They could push for their own government support or challenge the deal in court. Overall, competition might intensify in the chip sector.\nWill this move affect tech jobs?\nIntel may get new projects funded by government goals. This could create jobs in the U.S. However, if politics override profits, long-term hiring could shrink."

On paper, taxpayers are already sitting on a $1.9 billion gain.\n“The United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote in a social media post.\nThe investment represents a remarkable reversal for Trump, who just last week called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation over concerns about his past ties to Chinese firms. After a White House meeting and a public letter in which Tan pledged his allegiance to U.S. interests, Trump praised him Friday as a “highly respected” leader.\nTan, in a statement, thanked Trump for “driving historic investments in a vital industry” and vowed to restore Intel’s leadership in American manufacturing and technology.\nIntel, valued at roughly $108 billion, has shed more than 20,000 workers in recent months and is trading more than 60% below its late-1990s peak. By comparison, rival Nvidia is now worth $4.3 trillion, cementing its dominance in artificial intelligence chips.\nMuch of the stake derives from unspent CHIPS and Science Act incentives launched under President Joe Biden to spur U.S. semiconductor production. Trump officials, previously critical of the act, said the conversion ensures “America gets the benefit of the bargain,” in the words of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\nCritics warned the move could politicize the industry. Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute called it “a horrendous move” that risks distorting markets, while investor Nancy Tengler said the government should “let the private sector lead” rather than risk Trump’s direct involvement in Intel’s business.\nThe deal evokes comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis, when Washington took a majority stake in General Motors, ultimately selling at a $10 billion loss.\nStill, Trump’s team argues the Intel investment is different — a strategic bet to ensure U.S. chip independence amid a high-stakes technology race with China. Alongside the purchase, his administration has imposed a 15% commission on Nvidia and AMD’s China chip sales in exchange for export licenses.\n“The future of American technology leadership depends on reducing our reliance on overseas manufacturing,” Trump said. “This is about protecting jobs, security, and our lead in artificial intelligence.”"

      "text": "On Friday afternoon, Intel confirmed what everyone already knew: that the U.S. government is taking the unprecedented step of investing $8.9 billion into the company.\nOn Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the United States was pushing Intel to accept its $10.9 billion CHIPS Act funding as an equity deal instead. On Friday, President Trump confirmed that deal in a White House press conference. Intel now has formally published a statement outlining the terms of the agreement.\nThe government will invest $8.9 billion into Intel as part of a purchase of common stock, paid for by the $5.7 billion in grants awarded but not yet paid to Intel as part of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program, Intel said in a statement. The actual investment will total $11.1 billion, Intel said, because of $2.2 billion in CHIPS Axct grants that Intel has already received.\nAll told, the U.S. government will own 9.9 percent of Intel, made up of 433.3 million shares of Intel common stock at $20.47 per share. After hours, Intel’s share price had climbed to $24.80, but the government still received a discount.\nThe U.S. government said that its investment would be a passive one, “with no Board representation or other governance or information rights.” The government also pledged to vote with Intel in matters requiring shareholder approval. It remains to be seen whether President Trump, who is notoriously outspoken, adheres to these goals.\nThe government also has the option to purchase an additional basket of shares worth five percent of the company but only if Intel’s ownership of its foundry business drops below 51 percent.\nThat would seemingly cement Intel’s foundry aspirations, although the additional capital doesn’t solve the fundamental question: who will use it? Intel has previously said that it would slow an Ohio fab and put off manufacturing projects in Poland and Germany as it weathered layoffs. That provoked former chief executive Craig Barrett and others to suggest that Intel’s customers bail it out. Broadcom and TSMC were even named as suitors.\nTrump originally called for Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan to step down, citing concerns that his investments had close ties to the Chinese government — even though he allowed Nvidia and AMD to sell AI chips to Chinese government after paying 15 percent of its revenues. On Friday, Trump said that he had met with Tan, and that the Intel chief had agreed to pay $10 billion to the government, and that other, similar deals could happen as well.\n“As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” Tan said. “President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security.”\nIntel cited executives from Microsoft, Dell, HP, and AWS in support of the investment."

      "text": "“It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10 percent of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday.\nThe announcement came after Trump said earlier in the Oval Office on Friday that the CEO of Intel had agreed to such a deal, adding that he hopes to strike similar deals with other companies in the future.\n“I said, I think you should pay us 10 percent of your company,” Trump said of his conversations with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. “And they said yes.”\nTrump said the deal will was a win for both sides.\n“I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post announcing the deal. “The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.”\nThe agreement is part of an effort to help boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States and cement the US as a leader in the global chipmaking industry, a key priority of Trump’s second term so far.\nTrump has touted his close ties to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the AI chip giant’s investments in the US as political victories, using it as both a bargaining chip in trade talks with China and a means to pressure US companies like Intel to invest in the US. Trump said earlier this month that he plans to impose 100 percent tariffs on semiconductors coming into the country, except for companies that have committed to building products in the United States.\nTwo weeks ago, Trump called for Tan’s immediate resignation following reports about his alleged connections to China.\nIt is not immediately clear whether the Trump administration aims to be in strategic decision-making at the company. The deal gives the US government a passive ownership in Intel, according to the company’s press release, “with no Board representation or other governance or information rights.”\nThe remaining $5.7 billion that Intel had been awarded but not yet granted from the CHIPs and Science Act will fund the equity, along with $3.2 billion that Intel had been promised from the Department of Defense as part of the Secure Enclave program. The government is purchasing 433.3 million shares at a price of $20.47 per share, or a 9.9 percent stake in the company.\n“As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel, said in a press release.\nTrump also said he would do more of these types of deals. His administration has been weighing opportunities to take similar stakes in various US companies in critical industries, two people familiar with the White House discussions on the matter told CNN last week.\nThe chipmaker’s stock (INTC) rose seven percent on Friday.\nAfter Trump met with Tan at the White House last week, reports emerged that the White House was considering the unusual move of taking an stake in Intel. Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the discussions, saying the deal would likely involve converting grant funding from the Biden-era CHIPS Act into an equity stake.\n“America should get the benefit of the bargain,” Lutnick told CNBC.\nOn Friday following Trump’s announcement, Lutnick posted on X that “The United States of America now owns 10 percent of Intel, one of our great American technology companies.”\n“This historic agreement strengthens US leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge,” Lutnick said in the post. “Thanks to Intel CEO (Lip-Bu Tan) for striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.”\nLike his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, Trump has said that increasing domestic production of semiconductors is a national security priority, given their central role in products ranging from cars and iPhones to weapons and medical machinery. Currently, most of the world’s chips are produced in Taiwan, although several major tech companies have been investing in increased chipmaking capacity in the United States in recent years.\nAlthough it was once one of America’s most important tech companies, Intel has fallen behind rivals after failing to anticipate successive technology waves. Tan took over Intel in March and has been attempting to turn around the beleaguered company. Intel said last month that it had mostly completed plans to lay off 15 percent of its staff as part of Tan’s efforts to right the ship.\nJapan’s SoftBank on Monday said it would invest $2 billion into Intel.\nBloomberg reported last week that the White House wants to help Intel follow through on plans to open a new US manufacturing facility in Ohio, which has been repeatedly delayed amid the company’s financial troubles. And Bessent confirmed on CNBC that an Intel stake would be intended to “help stabilize the company for chip production here in the US.”\nBut it’s not clear how Trump’s investment will help directly solve some of Intel’s core problems, namely that it struggles to attract customers with chip technology that’s less advanced than that of competitors like TSMC.\nBessent indicated that the White House doesn’t plan to pressure other US tech companies to buy Intel’s chips. He added that “the last thing we’re going to do is put pressure, is take the stake and then try to drum up business.”\nIt’s not the first unusual deal Trump has reached with US semiconductor companies. Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD said earlier this month that they would pay 15 percent from their chip sales in China to the government in exchange for export licenses, after the White House had previously said selling their products there posed a national security risk."

      "text": "Donald Trump and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick have announced that the US government has secured a groundbreaking 10% stake in Intel through a partnership with struggling chip manufacturers. This marks another significant intervention by Corporate America’s White House.\nLutnick stated on X: “Big News: The United States now owns 10% of Intel, one of our nation’s leading technology firms. We extend our gratitude to Intel CEO @Lipbutan1 for negotiating fair agreements benefit Americans.”\nTrump met with Lipbu Tang on Friday and posed for a photo with Lutnick. This move was prompted by the US president’s demand for Intel’s resignation regarding its ties with Chinese companies after a previous meeting between Tang and Trump earlier this month.\n“He approached us to continue his efforts and ultimately committed $1 billion to the US, so we secured a billion,” Trump shared on Friday.\nAlthough Trump did not detail the $10 billion sum, it approximately corresponds to the financial assistance Intel receives from the government under the Chips and Science Act to build a US chip manufacturing facility.\nIntel’s investment is the latest in a series of extraordinary deals brokered by the US administration under Trump, including allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell H20 chips to China. Amd has similarly pursued a comparable transaction.\nAdditionally, the Department of Defense is poised to become the principal stakeholder in small mining companies, enhancing the production of rare earth magnets, with the US government negotiating specific veto rights and “golden shares” as part of a deal enabling Nippon Steel to acquire US steel.\nThe extensive range of US government interventions in corporate affairs is raising concerns among critics who argue that Trump’s measures will establish a new category of corporate risk.\nThis development follows a $2 billion capital infusion from SoftBank Group, a significant endorsement for a troubled US chipmaker now navigating a turnaround. Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, mentioned that Intel’s challenges extend beyond the financial boosts from SoftBank or government profits.\n“Without government backing and strong financial allies, it’s tough for Intel’s Foundry units to generate enough capital to keep expanding fabs at a reasonable pace,” he stated. “We need to catch up with TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] to be competitive technically.”\nThe 10% stake is valued at approximately $10 billion at the current stock price. Lutnick noted this week that these shares do not confer voting rights, meaning the US government cannot dictate the company’s operational decisions.\nFederal backing could provide Intel with more leeway to revitalize its struggling casting business, analysts observe, though it still faces weaknesses in its product roadmap and challenges in attracting customers to its new factories.\nTang, who took on a leading role at Intel in March, has the responsibility of reviving the iconic American chipmaker, which reported a loss of $18.8 billion in 2024—the first loss since 1986.\nSource: www.theguardian.com"

It will ensure that the chipmaker will receive about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the US.\nFunding Tied To CHIPS Act\nUnder the agreement, the US will purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, or $20.47 per share, which represents a discount of about $4 from Intel’s closing share price of $24.80 on Friday.\nThe purchase of the 433.3 million Intel shares will be made with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid grants from the Biden-era CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Secure Enclave program, also awarded under Trump’s predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden.\nIntel stock rose roughly 1% in the extended session on Friday after closing up 5.5% during regular trading.\nVictory in $10 Billion Deal\nTrump met with Tan on Friday, a White House official said.

      "text": "US Takes Nearly 10% Intel Stake, Clinching Unorthodox Deal\nIntel shares rose 5.5% to $24.80 at the close in New York on Friday.\nPresident Donald Trump sealed a deal that gives the US government a nearly 10% stake in Intel Corp., part of an unconventional bid to reinvigorate the beleaguered company and boost domestic chip manufacturing.\nUnder the agreement, the US will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock — representing 9.9% of the fully diluted common shares in Intel — according to a statement from the company. The $8.9 billion investment will be funded by grants from the US Chips and Science Act and Secure Enclave program that had previously been extended but not yet paid, Intel said, confirming a report by Bloomberg News.\nTogether with the $2.2 billion in Chips Act money that Intel already received, the investment totaled $11.1 billion. The government will be a passive owner, with no board seat or other governance or information rights, Intel said.\n“We are grateful for the confidence the president and the administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan said in the statement.\nIntel shares rose 5.5% to $24.80 at the close in New York on Friday. They slipped about 1% in choppy postmarket trading after the deal was finalized.\nIn a social media post, Trump described the transaction as a “great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL.”\n“Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation,” he said.\nBIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies.\n— Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) August 22, 2025\nThis historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure Americaâs technological edge.\nThanks to Intelâ¦ pic.twitter.com/AYMuX14Rgi\nThe US taking partial ownership marks a stunning level of intervention in an American company, cutting against the principles of free-market capitalism that investors and policymakers have long considered sacrosanct except in the most extraordinary situations, such as war or a systemic economic crisis.\nThe administration considers it an extraordinary and unique situation — and sees semiconductor production as a matter of national security, a White House official said. Intel is one of a small number of American companies capable of making chips at scale on domestic soil, the official said, and the administration looks to avoid shortages like those in recent years that rattled US supply chains.\nThough the administration telegraphed its intentions with Intel in recent weeks, the move creates untold risks that could distort markets and the flow of capital as well as lead to massive taxpayer losses. But the government’s bet could also pay off in a major way for a onetime industry pioneer. Intel has faced a turbulent stretch with investors worried it is losing its technological edge and falling too far behind competitors.\nThe approach represents a new way for Trump to wield Chips Act funding, after long assailing the law signed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Trump has said the law’s subsidies for semiconductor manufacturers didn’t provide any return for US taxpayers. Intel was already poised to be the biggest beneficiary of money from the Chips Act.\nAs part of the pact, the government will receive a five-year warrant — at $20 per share for an additional 5% of common stock — that’s only exercisable if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of its chip-manufacturing business. PJT Partners served as Intel’s financial adviser on the transaction.\nSanta Clara, California-based Intel touted its more than $100 billion effort to expand manufacturing in the US and its new factory in Arizona, which is set to begin high-volume production this year. But it didn’t discuss a facility planned for Ohio that has been repeatedly delayed.\nThe deal represents a dramatic reversal from earlier this month, when Trump called for Tan’s ouster and accused him of being “highly conflicted” because of concerns over his earlier ties to China. Those remarks prompted the sit-down between the president and the Intel CEO, laying the groundwork for Friday’s deal.\n“I said, ‘You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel,’ and he said, ‘I would consider that,’ and I said, ‘Well, I’d like you to do that,’” Trump said of his discussion with Tan.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has signaled that Trump wants to see more direct benefits to the US from funding key companies instead of just giving away grants. Lutnick worked to finalize the details of the agreement since Tan and Trump’s meeting.\nWhile the White House has cast the Intel deal as a possible template for other companies, they haven’t said which ones it may be having similar discussions with. A US official, however, said that companies that are boosting US investment pledges, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Micron Technology Inc., will not be pressured to offer equity in exchange for funding.\nThe fresh infusion of nearly $9 billion instantly boosts growth prospects for the company. It also opens the door to partnerships that could be critical in developing new intellectual property and technology, areas where Intel has lagged in recent years.\nStill, in order for government ownership to boost Intel, Trump will have to do more than just take a stake. Wall Street analysts don’t expect money alone to turn around the company, which has suffered from years of declining sales and market share. But there is a possibility that pressure from Trump will help line up more clients for Intel’s production arm, potentially justifying the cost of expanding domestic manufacturing.\n“Trump kind of becomes your salesman,” said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust who has covered the company since the 1990s.\nLining up more Intel clients might be a tough sell for Trump. The company’s chip-manufacturing arm is widely considered inferior to rivals and it still must build new cutting-edge facilities.\n“Beside money, Intel needs customers,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients. “Funding a buildout with no customers probably won’t end well for shareholders, of whom the US government would be the largest under this situation,” he said.\nIn its statement, Intel said it was “deeply engaged” with current and potential clients and partners that could help build up the US chip supply chain. Microsoft Corp., Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS all pledged support as part of the announcement.\n“The industry needs a strong and resilient US semiconductor industry, and no company is more important to this mission than Intel,” Michael Dell, CEO of the namesake computer maker, said in the statement.\nThe Intel deal exemplifies how Trump has embraced a new brand of economic statecraft in his second term, as he looks to bolster domestic manufacturing, rebalance trade ties and ensure American dominance in critical sectors.\nTrump in early August announced a legally questionable arrangement with Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., in which they agreed to give the US government 15% of revenue generated from sales of artificial intelligence chips to China.\nThat followed Trump securing a “golden share” from Nippon Steel Corp. that gives the president power to make decisions over United States Steel Corp., which the Japanese steelmaker acquired. The Defense Department last month also announced that it will take a $400 million equity stake in little-known US rare-earths firm MP Materials Corp."

The move comes just days after the company secured a $2 billion injection from SoftBank.\nDespite the boost, Intel’s stock tumbled nearly 7% on Wednesday, erasing earlier gains tied to the SoftBank deal and reports that the Trump administration may step in with its own involvement.\nGovernment Pressure and Investor Concerns\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this week that any U.S. support from the CHIPS Act should come with an equity stake for Washington, underscoring the administration’s tougher stance on corporate accountability.\n“They need money to build whatever it is that the customers may actually, ultimately want,” CNBC’s David Faber noted on-air. “And having the CHIPS Act money, which is free, so to speak, no strings attached, become equity is not helpful to them because it’s dilutive.”\nStruggles in AI and Manufacturing\nIntel is in the middle of a turnaround plan after years of shrinking sales and dwindling market share. The company has lagged behind rivals in capitalizing on the AI chip boom while pouring billions into its foundry business, which has yet to secure a significant customer.\nLeadership has also shifted. Lip-Bu Tan took over as CEO in March after Pat Gelsinger’s ouster. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump publicly called for Tan’s resignation, labeling him “highly CONFLICTED,” though the president’s tone softened following Tan’s visit to the White House.\nAuthor’s Opinion\nIntel’s situation highlights the risks of trying to rebuild an empire in the middle of a rapidly shifting industry. Pouring money into factories without a clear pipeline of customers is dangerous, no matter how much political or corporate backing exists. Intel still has brand recognition and Washington’s attention, but if it can’t secure major AI chip orders soon, no amount of discounted equity will stop it from losing relevance in a market where speed and partnerships matter most.\nFeatured image credit: Morton Lin via Flickr\nFor more stories like it, click the +Follow button at the top of this page to follow us."

      "text": "- Trump is linking national security interests with aggressive industrial policy: giant government investments in semiconductors, rare earths—and even creative “pay-for-play” deals with AI titans like Nvidia.\nUS President Donald Trump announced that the United States would take a 10 per cent stake in struggling chip giant Intel. The surprise move is turning heads—not just for its size ($8.9 billion), but for how boldly the White House is inserting itself into America’s corporate engine room.\nThe US government has agreed to purchase 9.9 per cent of Intel, making them a real heavyweight in the legacy chipmaker’s future. The purchase price? $20.47 per share, which is a relatively sweet deal, considering Intel closed Friday at $24.80. That’s about $4 below the market—nothing to sneeze at for taxpayers footing the bill.\nTo pay for the shares, the White House is tapping two big sources: $5.7 billion in still-unspent Chips Act grants and $3.2 billion slated for a project called Secure Enclave. Together, those funds make the acquisition possible without needing a new Congressional fight over spending.\nHigh-stakes negotiations\nIntel’s CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has had a whirlwind month. He was called to a tense sit-down with President Trump earlier in August—a meeting originally triggered by Trump’s fiery call for Tan to quit over his history with Chinese firms.\nInstead of walking out with a pink slip, Tan seems to have walked away with $10 billion for Intel and a deal that’s got tongues wagging across the financial sector.\nAfter the accord, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick didn’t waste a minute declaring: “The United States of America now owns 10 per cent of Intel.” He emphasised that the transaction was “fair to Intel and fair to the American People,” positioning it as a win-win—though critics may see it differently.\nA pattern of unusual moves\nFriday’s Intel investment is only the latest in a string of extraordinary government interventions:\n- The US clinched a deal with Nvidia: it must let Washington receive a 15 per cent cut of H20 AI chip sales to China.\n- The Pentagon is about to become the biggest shareholder in a lesser-known rare earth magnet maker.\n- The government snatched up a “golden share” with powerful veto rights as Nippon Steel seeks to acquire US Steel.\nThese policy pivots are stirring discomfort among critics who worry that ever-deeper government entanglement could reshape how risks are calculated in corporate America.\nWhy Intel? Why now?\nIntel has suffered a bruising two years, posting an eye-popping $18.8 billion loss in 2024—the first red ink the company’s seen since the 1980s. Their once-mighty foundry business is coughing and wheezing, falling far behind Taiwan’s TSMC in technology and market share.\nThe White House also insists it’s not seeking similar deals with other chipmakers, like TSMC or Micron, for now.\nBut overall, Trump’s break-the-mold approach is clear. He’s linking national security interests with aggressive industrial policy: giant government investments in semiconductors, rare earths—and even creative “pay-for-play” deals with AI titans like Nvidia.\nIt’s a bold and risky path, and the results are bound to ripple through both the economy and policy debates for years to come."

      "text": "The Trump administration and Intel have reached an agreement for the U.S. government to own nearly 10 percent of the struggling chip maker, the president announced on Friday.\n“The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, claiming the agreement means the government “fully owns and controls” a major portion of the company.\n“This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation,” he added.\nFunding for the $11.1 billion deal comes from $2.2 billion in funding Intel received under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, plus $5.7 billion from the act the company was awarded but has not received, as well as $3.2 in funds already awarded as part of the Secure Enclave national security program, the company announced on its website.\nThe stake is in the form of passive ownership and does not give the government board representation or other governance rights, Intel said, adding that the U.S. had an option to purchase further shares.\n“As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement. “President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security.”\nThe deal marks a striking change in tone from the administration, as well as the most consequential government investment in a single U.S. company since the multi-billion-dollar auto bailout of GM and Chrysler during the 2008 financial crisis.\nEarlier this month, Trump called on Tan to resign, accusing the CEO of being “highly conflicted” because of his past work and investments in the Chinese tech sector.\nThe administration said the deal sprang from negotiations last week with the Intel boss, who “walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States,” Trump said at a news conference.\nA framework for the deal between Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Intel finance chief David Zinsner was solidified on Wednesday, The New York Times reports.\nFollowing the announcement of the deal, Lutnick praised the agreement “as fair to Intel and fair to the American People,” posting a photo on X of himself with Tan.\n“This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge,” Lutnick wrote.\nThe deal could face legal challenges from shareholders, and some experts say it’s unclear if the CHIPS Act funds can legally be turned into equity.\nSome observers were also unsure if a government investment would turn things around for Intel, a pioneering Silicon Valley chip maker that has struggled in recent years as competitors like Nvidia outpaced it on key innovations like chips for artificial intelligence.\n“The questions I have are first, what are the guardrails to ensure that a government stake doesn’t result in unhelpful political influence on the company, and, second, how exactly a government stake will facilitate the financial turnaround,” economic historian Chris Miller told The Washington Post.\nIntel shares were up more than 5.5 percent as of Friday afternoon.\nThe Trump administration previously sharply criticized the Biden-era CHIPS Act for awarding billions to revive the U.S. semiconductor industry, which makes key components for computers and numerous other devices with digital components, arguing the act was a giveaway to companies that didn’t result in enough benefit to the American people.\nThe White House, which has also negotiated “golden share”-style government influence over Nippon Steel’s investment in U.S. Steel, has shown particular interest in putting Trump’s mark on the semiconductor industry, which has largely moved to Asia in recent decades.\nTrump said this month he plans to put a 100 percent tariff on computer chips unless companies build in the U.S., and the administration agreed to a deal to receive 15 percent of Nvidia and AMD’s revenues from the sale of the companies’ chips in China."

      "text": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick delivered major news on Friday, confirming that the United States has finalized an investment deal with Intel, securing a 10% ownership stake in the semiconductor powerhouse. This development marks a significant step in bolstering America’s position in global technology amid ongoing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and competition from abroad.\nThe agreement stems from negotiations tied to the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which aimed to revitalize domestic chip production. Under the terms, the U.S. gains a nonvoting equity position in Intel in return for federal funding support.\nWhile specific financial details remain under wraps, the move aligns with efforts to ensure taxpayer dollars yield tangible returns for national interests. Intel, for its part, has committed billions to constructing advanced manufacturing facilities in Ohio, with full operations expected by 2030. This follows an $8 billion grant finalized last fall to accelerate those projects.\nLutnick shared the update via a post on X, emphasizing the deal’s importance for economic growth and security.\n“The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,” he wrote. “This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge. Thanks to Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan for striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.”\nPresident Donald Trump had hinted at the arrangement earlier in the week, highlighting it as a way to expand American influence over critical industries. Sources indicate the stake could be valued around $10 billion, reflecting Intel’s substantial market presence and the scale of federal incentives involved. For conservatives, this represents a pragmatic approach to industrial policy—using government resources not for endless subsidies, but to foster self-reliance and protect against foreign dependencies, particularly from China and Taiwan, where much of the world’s chip production is concentrated.\nThe CHIPS Act itself, passed under a previous administration, has faced criticism for slow rollout and bureaucratic hurdles. Yet under Trump’s leadership, deals like this one demonstrate a renewed focus on execution, prioritizing American workers and innovation. Intel’s Ohio investments alone promise thousands of high-paying jobs in a heartland state, underscoring the administration’s commitment to rebuilding manufacturing at home.\nCritics from the left may decry increased government involvement in private enterprise, but proponents argue it’s essential for safeguarding national security in an era of geopolitical tensions. As Lutnick noted, the pact benefits both Intel and the public, positioning the U.S. to lead in semiconductors—a sector vital for everything from consumer electronics to defense systems.\nThis deal could set a precedent for future public-private partnerships, ensuring that American ingenuity drives global progress while keeping strategic assets firmly under domestic control.

China will no longer buy any of their chips thanks to Trump. Or Nvidia either. Some 64% of their business is gone overnight. So the US wants to get into the chip game? If it wasn’t so sad, it would be laughable.\nI do think it’s illegal for the federal government to financially prop up a private business and reap a profit from future earnings.\nIs it to instill confidence in American manufacturing? That’s odd because American automobile manufacturers are foreign parts assembled in USA.\nThis sounds like something Chairman Mao would be proud of.\nSupporting Trump is one thing, but I don´t make him an idol.\nHe gets it right about 90% of the time …. well, maybe 80.\nImv, this is NOT cool.\nWho allowed this?\nDid they understand the implications?\nBad idea for the US Federal Gov and for Intel.\nCould be an opportunity to install spyware. We are not the only party doing it. We would be fools not to. America First! ULTRAMAGA!"

      "text": "Trump says US government will take 10% stake in Intel\nU.S. President Donald Trump today announced that the federal government will receive Intel Corp. shares in exchange for the CHIPS Act financing the company won last year.\nTrump detailed the deal, which confirms recent media reports, during a White House press briefing. He told attendees the U.S. government will take a 10% stake in Intel.\nIn a statement released a few hours after the briefing, the chipmaker detailed that the government will receive 433.3 million shares of common stock for $20.47 apiece. That’s a slight discount to today’s closing price. Intel stated that the stake won’t come with a board seat. Additionally, the U.S. government has agreed to vote with the company’s board on matters requiring shareholder approval “with limited exceptions.”\nThe agreement includes a warrant that gives the White House the option to buy another 5% of Intel’s common shares in the next five years. According to the company, the warrant can only be exercised if it “ceases to own at least 51% of the foundry business.” Earlier this year, rumors emerged that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. had floated the idea of taking an up to 50% stake in Intel’s foundry unit.\n“As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the U.S., Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement today.\nA few years ago, Intel launched a multibillion-dollar initiative to expand its U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. The plan is set to see the company build several new fabs in Arizona and Ohio. The company also intends to revamp a number of existing chip plants by upgrading them to new manufacturing processes, expanding their production capacity or both.\nLast November, the Biden administration provided Intel with $7.86 billion worth of federal grants to support the manufacturing push. A few months earlier, the company won $3 billion in federal financing as part of a separate initiative called Secure Enclave. The latter program is set to see Intel produce chips for the U.S. defense sector.\nThe stake that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government will be provided in exchange for the grants it won in 2024. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the White House isn’t expected to increase the amount of federal financing available to the chipmaker. However, it’s believed that the government may accelerate the disbursement of the grants issued last year.\nTrump remarked during today’s press briefing that “we do a lot of deals like that. I’ll do more of them.” That suggests the White House may seek stakes in additional chipmakers. Rumors of such a plan first emerged on Wednesday, when Reuters reported that the administration would focus on CHIPS Act funding recipients.\nTSMC, Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Inc. are among the companies that have received federal grants under the legislation. Sources told the Wall Street Journal today that the White House has no plans to take stakes in TSMC and Micron because they’re actively upgrading their U.S. manufacturing infrastructure.\nPhoto: Intel\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\nSupport our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

      "text": "'I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel': US president Trump wants a piece of the action, says CEO Lip Bu Tan has already forked over $10 billion because he wants to 'keep his job'\nThe deal might already be done.\nUS president Donald Trump says Intel should give the US government a 10% stake in the company, echoing a recent statement made by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who said earlier this week that the US government should get an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funding.\nTrump had actually called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan earlier this month over his alleged ties to China, but minds apparently changed following a meeting between the two, as the US government began talks about taking a stake in the company. Lutnick then said Intel's funding under the CHIPS Act, which Trump called \"a horrible, horrible thing\" earlier this year, should come in exchange for providing a stake in the company.\nIt's a position the US president shares. Asked about \"the 10%\" while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office today, Trump said:\n\"I met a man, he was a very nice man, and I called for his removal because I saw something by a man named Tom Cotton, a senator from Arkansas. He's a great guy, friend of mine, supporter of mine, big supporter. I was a supporter of him too. And he wrote a pretty nasty story about the head of Intel, and I said, 'Well, that's right, he should resign,' and he came and he saw me, and we talked for a while. I liked him a lot, I thought he was very good. I thought he was somewhat a victim, but you know, nobody's a total victim, I guess. And I said, 'You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel.' And he said, 'I would consider that.' I said, 'Well I would like you to do that,' because Intel's been left behind, as you know, compared to Jensen and some of our friends, Nvidia and some of the people, and people in—Intel should have never been—Intel was the biggest, most powerful chip company in the world.\"\nTrump: \"I said, 'You know what? I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel.'\"\n— @atrupar.com (@atrupar.com.bsky.social) 2025-08-22T20:51:14.318Z\nTrump then went on to suggest that the deal had already been done. \"I think it's a great deal for them, I think it's a great deal—he walked in, wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion, to the United States. So we picked up 10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that. I'll do more of them.\"\nTrump on Intel boss: \"He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. We do a lot of deals like that. I'll do more of them.\"\n— @atrupar.com (@atrupar.com.bsky.social) 2025-08-22T20:51:14.325Z\nIt should be somewhat unexpected to see a purportedly conservative figurehead advocating for the state to seize the means of production—Ronald Reagan would never—but, as far as I can make sense of any of this, that does seem to be what's happening here, spiritually anyway. And it's resulted in a sort of political alliance of convenience that makes even less sense as a team-up than Batman and Green Arrow.\n\"I am glad the Trump administration is in agreement with the amendment I offered three years ago,\" US senator Bernie Sanders, a Democrat and one of Trump's most vociferous opponents, said in a statement provided to Reuters. \"Taxpayers should not be providing billions of dollars in corporate welfare to large, profitable corporations like Intel without getting anything in return.\"\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nI don't think governments should be providing funding to multi-billion-dollar companies, but I also don't think they should be 'investing' in them—picking winners and losers in the markets is not what governments are for. But I don't think any of the rest of this bullshit should be happening either, and given all that we've seen in the recent past—thinking a lot about Apple CEO Tim Cook's golden gift here—I imagine the Trump administration will get its cut, and having established that precedent, will go after other companies for the same thing.

      "text": "President Trump said on Friday he had asked Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan for a 10% stake in the company during a recent meeting at the White House.\n“He agreed, and they’ve agreed to do it, and I think it’s a great deal for them,” Trump told reporters. “He walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States,” Trump said.\nNeither Intel nor the White House press team immediately responded to requests for comment.\nBut should such a deal move ahead, it would be a highly unusual step — it would mark an escalation in the Trump administration’s efforts to push chipmakers to manufacture in the United States, and a new milestone in how willing CEOs are to cede the president an unprecedented amount of control over their companies.\nThe nature of how a deal might work is not yet clear — and neither is the response of Intel’s board or shareholders.\nEarlier this week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that a potential deal for an Intel stake would convert grants to Intel from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into equity. The law authorized a total of nearly $53 billion in government funding for chip-related activities.\n“So we’ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We’ll get equity in return for it,” Lutnick said, adding the stake would not give the government voting or governance rights in Intel.\nAfter Trump’s remarks, Lutnick posted on X that the U.S. “now owns 10% of Intel,” and he called it a “historic agreement.”\nIntel, once a leader in chip production, has faced a raft of problems in recent years.\nIt has stumbled in the race to feed soaring data center demand for chips used to build artificial intelligence models known as graphics processing units, or GPUs. The leader in that field is Intel’s Santa Clara, California-based neighbor Nvidia, now the world’s biggest company with a market capitalization of over $4 trillion.\n(Earlier in August, Trump announced that Nvidia would pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenues of H20 chip sales in China in exchange for being allowed to sell them there. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on the 15% figure, and in a statement, the company said it follows “rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.”)\nIntel’s revenue has fallen in recent years, driving its market capitalization down. This year, the company reported net losses for the first two quarters.\nPresident Trump took direct aim at Intel CEO Tan earlier this month, calling on him to resign following reports he invested in a range of Chinese tech companies. Days later, Tan went to the White House for a face-to-face meeting with the president, after which Trump called the meeting “interesting” and Tan a “success.”\nIntel is planning to invest more than $28 billion in two chip production facilities in Ohio, but the plans have been delayed and analysts say it is unclear if there will be sufficient demand for the chips the company eventually produces.\n“One of the questions that we still haven’t seen answers to yet in the public sphere, at least, is how this discussion about equity financing relates to the question of who’s going to be the customer for Intel’s factories that are being built and their processes or their manufacturing processes that are being brought online,” said Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.\n“That’s a key part of the puzzle,” he said, adding it was too early to know if a potential equity deal would be a boon for Intel or complicate the company’s efforts to try to lead the field again."

      "text": "The Biden-era CHIPS Act was designed to revive America’s semiconductor sector, but under the Trump administration, that funding is taking a new form: direct equity ownership. On Friday, President Trump announced that the U.S. government will acquire a 10% stake in Intel, a move aimed at stabilizing the struggling chipmaker and cementing its role in America’s technology future.\nThe announcement sparked immediate investor reaction, sending Intel shares up more than 7% in midday trading. The move represents one of the most aggressive interventions in U.S. industrial policy in recent years, underscoring Washington’s belief that semiconductors are not only an economic priority but also a national security imperative.\nIntel has endured a turbulent few years. Once the undisputed leader in computer processors, the company has seen its dominance erode as rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm gained ground in the PC market. Meanwhile, Nvidia has surged ahead in artificial intelligence chips, leaving Intel far behind in one of the fastest-growing and most strategically critical corners of the tech world.\nFinancially, the company has struggled to contain mounting losses. Its manufacturing division continues to bleed cash, while its market capitalization of roughly $111 billion is less than half of what it was in 2021. Under current CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Intel has been forced to make difficult cuts, laying off 15% of its workforce and shelving ambitious international expansion plans, including new facilities in Europe.\nStill, Intel holds unique strategic importance. It remains the only U.S.-based company capable of producing advanced semiconductors at scale, a capability that has become increasingly vital as the global chip supply chain faces geopolitical risks. With tensions between the U.S. and China intensifying, reshoring semiconductor manufacturing has become a bipartisan priority in Washington.\nTrump’s announcement also comes just days after Japan’s SoftBank Group revealed a $2 billion investment in Intel, signaling international confidence that the company may yet succeed in its turnaround. Even so, the road ahead remains challenging. Intel’s $20 billion Ohio chip complex—once heralded as the centerpiece of America’s semiconductor revival—has been delayed again, reflecting the company’s struggle to balance ambition with financial discipline.\nAt the same time, Intel is trying to reinvent itself as a contract chip manufacturer, or foundry, capable of producing semiconductors for other firms. Microsoft and Amazon have already signed agreements to use Intel’s newest 18A chip technology, but Intel itself remains its largest foundry customer, raising questions about whether it can truly scale the business to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\nThe U.S. government’s decision to become a shareholder in Intel adds a new layer of complexity. Supporters argue it provides Intel with the financial stability and political backing it needs to remain competitive in a cutthroat industry. Critics, however, caution that government ownership could distort market dynamics and discourage private-sector innovation.\nFor now, markets appear optimistic. Intel’s rally suggests investors see Washington’s stake as a sign of long-term commitment to keeping the company afloat. With global demand for chips set to surge alongside artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and cloud computing, Intel’s future may hinge on whether government backing can help it reclaim its leadership position in one of the world’s most consequential industries."
