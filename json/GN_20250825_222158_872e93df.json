The plea deal offer reportedly expires Monday morning.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on social media saying Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation.\nA notice last Friday said the administration might attempt to deport him to Uganda."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and later returned to the U.S., was taken into federal custody Monday morning by immigration authorities. An attorney for Abrego Garcia confirmed the news to NPR.\nThe detention, which was expected, happened minutes after Abrego Garcia walked into the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Baltimore for a check-in after being released from federal custody on Friday in Tennessee pending a trial on separate criminal charges.\nTalking to supporters gathered outside the building, Abrego Garcia said seeing his family over the weekend filled him with hope, and said those moments “will give me strength to continue fighting.”\n“God is with us. God will never leave us. God will bring justice to all of the injustice we are suffering,” Abrego Garcia said, fighting through tears.\nAbrego Garcia on Monday filed a lawsuit challenging his current detention and any deportation to Uganda or any other country until a trial is held at an immigration court.\nIn a statement after his detention, Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said Abrego Garcia is being processed “for removal to Uganda.”\nAt the core of Abrego Garcia’s case is the question of due process under President Trump’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The man was arrested in March and sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to the Central American country because of the “well-founded fear” of gang persecution there. The Trump administration conceded Abrego Garcia’s removal was an “administrative error,” and returned him to the U.S. in June, to face criminal charges.\nHe was indicted on two charges, including conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants and unlawful transportation of migrants without legal status.\nThe Trump administration has said it intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, despite the latter government indicating last week it prefers to receive people from other African countries and individuals without criminal records.\nAbrego Garcia’s attorneys said in a court filing that the U.S. government has offered the possibility of deporting him to Costa Rica if Abrego Garcia pled guilty to the criminal charges against him and served the imposed sentence. His attorneys have said that move is “coercive” and “vindictive.”\n“Regardless of what happens today with ICE, please promise me that you will keep fighting, praying, believing in the dignity and the liberty for not only me, but for everyone,” Abrego Garcia told supporters."

just arrested Democrats' favorite MS-13 associate — and now he's getting the boot for good | Blaze Media Cookie Settings\nMENU\n© 2025 Blaze Media LLC. All rights reserved.\nPhoto by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\nMS-13 associate Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Salvadoran national credibly accused of human trafficking, domestic abuse, and posing a danger to the community — was deported back to his home country earlier this year, where he was housed in a prison for terrorists.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (Md.) and Reps. Robert Garcia (Calif.), Maxwell Frost (Fla.), Yassamin Ansari (Ariz.), and Maxine Dexter (Ore.) were among the Democrats who complained about the MS-13 associate's ouster and imprisonment and demanded his return.\n'Remember that I am free, and I was able to be reunited with my family.'\nDemocrats technically got what they wanted, but Garcia's story did not ultimately play out as they may have hoped.\nGarcia was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges over his involvement in an alleged multistate human trafficking operation, then temporarily held at the Putnam County Jail in Tennessee.\nAbrego Garcia's lawyer, Sean Hecker, told WZTV-TV on Friday that Garcia was free, \"presently en route to his family in Maryland, after being unlawfully arrested and deported and then imprisoned, all because of the government's vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back against the administration's continuing assault on the rule of law.\"\nThe Department of Homeland Security confirmed to Blaze News that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has cut short the MS-13 associate's time with his family.\nRELATED: Last week for John Oliver? Barmy Brit fears Trump will put him on ICE\nPhoto by Alex Wong/Getty Images\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to Blaze News, \"Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation.\"\n\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator, to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" added Noem.\nBefore surrendering to ICE in Baltimore on Monday, Garcia told supporters, \"Brothers and sisters, my name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this: Remember that I am free, and I was able to be reunited with my family.\"\nImmigration officials reportedly offered to send Garcia packing to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty to the human smuggling charges. Since he apparently chose not to take the deal, he will apparently be deported to Uganda.\nLike Blaze News?

His case on human trafficking is still ongoing in Tennessee.\nAs The Gateway Pundit reported earlier, MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia may be deported to the East African country of Uganda after his release from a Tennessee jail on Friday. According to Fox News’ Bill Melugin, the DHS notified Abrego Garcia that his deportation will happen “no earlier than 72 hours from now.”\nAbrego Garcia traveled back to Maryland to be with his family over the weekend.\nA federal grand jury in Tennessee recently indicted Abrego Garcia for “transporting undocumented migrants within the United States.” He was charged with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.\nAbrego Garcia was an illegal alien residing in Maryland when he was deported to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year and placed in the notorious CECOT prison; however, leftist judges ordered him to be returned to the US.\nOn Monday morning Abrego Garcia turned himself in to ICE in Baltimore. He faces possible deportation to Uganda after refusing to plea guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\nFOX News reporte David Spunt is covering the latest this morning in Maryland:\nDavid Spunt: About 200 people here to support Kilmer Arbrego Garcia. He walked into the building about 30 minutes behind me for that ICE check-in. This is not a court hearing. This is just a court-mandated check-in with ICE, a status quo hearing to see exactly what’s going on with his status in front of ICE officials. We’re going to wait to see what happens, whether he walks out with an ankle bracelet to go home, or is he going to be deported, as you mentioned, to Uganda? His supporters say that he’s a Maryland man, a Maryland dad, a good person, but the government says he’s MS 13, part of a notorious gang in El Salvador, his home country. Again, we were out here a couple of hours ago as this began. You see people that are there praising Garcia. He doesn’t want to go back to Uganda or go to Uganda in the first place, though it’s unclear if he’s going to go anywhere today at all.\nVideo via Midnight Rider.\nThey are singing again! pic.twitter.com/rhAgMhNoOn\n— Karli Bonne’ (@KarluskaP) August 25, 2025"

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, at center of Trump immigration crackdown, detained again\nThe Maryland resident whose wrongful deportation fueled protests over the Trump administration plan to send migrants to a Salvadoran mega-prison was detained by U.S. immigration officials on Monday and could be deported again.\nKilmar Abrego Garcia, 30, reported to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore three days after being released from criminal custody in Tennessee and returned to his home in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Beltsville. He has spent more than five months in detention, including time in his native El Salvador at a prison known for its harsh conditions.\n\"ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia & are processing him for deportation,\" the White House said in a social media post. \"@POTUS is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, & child predator to terrorize American citizens...\" - @Sec_Noem.\"\nAbrego Garcia, who has repeatedly denied those claims, arrived at the ICE office Monday with his wife and brother and was quickly surrounded by a crowd of supporters chanting \"Si se puede,\" Spanish for \"Yes we can.\" He and his wife embraced in the building's lobby before proceeding through a security checkpoint.\nHIs lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said his client was detained upon reporting for an interview. U.S. officials have offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he pleads guilty to transporting migrants living illegally in the U.S., his lawyers say.\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say they have entered plea discussions with the government to avoid deportation to Uganda, which they say would be \"far more dangerous\" than Costa Rica.\n\"They're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"They're weaponizing the immigration system in a way that's completely unconstitutional.\"\nAbrego Garcia claims he was beaten, tortured\nAbrego Garcia was mistakenly deported and taken to the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in March. The Trump administration has admitted in court documents that the deportation was a mistake, which it blamed it on an “administrative error.”\nAbrego Garcia experienced \"severe beatings\" and \"psychological torture\" in the notorious high-security prison, his lawyers said in a court filing last month. The filing also says that Abrego Garcia experienced \"severe sleep deprivation\" and nutrition so inadequate that he lost 31 pounds.\nLawsuit filed in Maryland seeking to ban deportation\nAbrego Garcia has filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland seeking an order to ban deporting him anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has blamed “activist liberal judges” for blocking administration efforts to remove people living in the U.S. illegally who were suspected of committing crimes.\n“By ordering this monster loose on America’s streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people,” Noem said. “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.”\nTrump administration has focused on Abrego Garcia\nAbrego Garcia, a sheetmetal worker living in suburban Washington, DC, became the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping and controversial deportation tactics.\nAbrego Garcia entered the country illegally around 2012 as a teen. Immigration officials issued a final order of removal in 2019, but they said he could not be released to his home country of El Salvador because of credible fears of persecution by gangs in that country.\nContributing: Amanda Lee Myers, USA TODAY; Reuters"

      "text": "Abrego Garcia detained by ICE as possible second deportation looms\nKilmar Abrego Garcia has been taken into custody after arriving at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Baltimore.\nIn a statement, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem confirmed his arrest and said that ICE \"are processing him for deportation\".\nHe was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador in March, and then brought back to face criminal charges.\nUS authorities have informed him he may be deported to Uganda, following his refusal to accept a plea deal, his lawyers say.\nHis legal team accuses the US of trying to \"coerce\" him to plead guilty by threatening to re-deport him \"halfway across the world\".\n\"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him, to punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,\" one of his attorneys, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters outside the ICE office.\nHe said that Mr Abrego Garcia had filed a new federal lawsuit in Maryland challenging his current detention and potential deportation \"to Uganda or any other country\" until he has a trial.\nA subsequent court order barred the government from removing Mr Abrego Garcia from the continental United States or altering his legal status until 16:00 Wednesday, unless a judge extends the order.\nThe new lawsuit has been assigned to US District Judge Paula Xinis, the same jurist who oversaw the initial lawsuit over Mr Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to El Salvador.\nThey have said their client declined an offer to plead guilty to human smuggling charges in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica. He was asked to check in on Monday at the field office in Baltimore.\nDuring the interview, Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg said ICE officers had taken Mr Abrego Garica into custody with no explanation. An officer told the attorneys he would be taken to a detention center but would not specify which one.\nHis attorney argued there was no reason to detain Mr Abrego Garcia, as he was under ankle monitoring and \"basically on house arrest\".\nHis supporters now fear he faces a second deportation - this time to Uganda, a country where he has no known ties.\nSupporters held a rally outside the premises in support of the Salvadorean national, whose drawn out immigration case has made global headlines.\nIn a statement, Ms Noem alleged Mr Abrego Garcia was guilty of human trafficking and domestic abuse. President Donald Trump would not allow him to \"terrorise American citizens any longer\".\nThe US reached bilateral deportation agreements with Honduras and Uganda as part of the Trump crackdown on illegal immigration.\nDocuments obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, quote Uganda's foreign ministry as saying it prefers individuals it accepts to be from African countries.\nThe saga of Mr Abrego Garcia's deportation case has been in the news since March when he was deported to his native El Salvador, and initially kept in the notorious Cecot prison.\nBut after US government officials acknowledged he was deported due to an \"administrative error\", a judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return.\nHe was sent to Tennessee where he was charged in a human smuggling scheme and detained until his release on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge.\nMr Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the charges."

      "text": "Federal immigration authorities took custody of Kilmar Abrego Garcia early Monday morning and he is expected to be deported to Africa or Central America.\nAbrego Garcia, an illegal migrant from El Salvador, was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after checking into a detention center in Baltimore, Maryland, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Salvadoran national has become one of the biggest faces of the Trump administration’s deportation agenda after being sent back to his home country earlier this year and then returned to face human smuggling charges. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Feds Arrest Brother Of Illegal Migrant Truck Driver Accused Of Killing Three In Accident)\n“Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a post on Monday. “President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer.”\nShortly before walking into the ICE field office on Monday, the alleged gangbanger addressed a crowd of supporters who had gathered outside.\n“To all the families who have been separated or to all the families who have been threatened with family separation, this administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something,” Abrego Garcia said in Spanish, requiring an English translator. “God is with us and God will never leave us. God will bring justice to all of the injustice we are suffering.”\nBeside Abrego Garcia as he spoke was his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who had repeatedly accused him of domestic abuse before he was first deported from the U.S.\nFederal immigration authorities first deported Abrego Garcia — who had been living unlawfully in the U.S. for years — to his home country of El Salvador in March, where he briefly stayed at the country’s infamous CECOT mega-prison. He became a major name after the public discovered he was previously granted a withholding of removal order by a judge that prohibited his removal to El Salvador, prompting outcry from Democrats who repeatedly demanded he be returned to the U.S.\nThe Trump administration facilitated his return to the U.S. in June for him to face human smuggling charges. Over the course of nearly a decade, Abrego Garcia allegedly made more than 100 trips across the U.S., smuggling illegal migrants, drugs and guns, according to a grand jury indictment.\nThe Salvadoran’s human smuggling charges stem from a Tennessee Highway Patrol stop in 2022. During the traffic stop, officers suspected Abrego Garcia of human smuggling after noticing that none of eight other passengers he was driving had any luggage, and all of them claimed Abrego Garcia’s address as their own.\nThe illegal migrant was released from a Tennessee jail on Friday, where he immediately returned to his residence in the Baltimore area. Federal immigration authorities have since offered him a choice: plead guilty to the human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence or else face deportation to Uganda, according to his attorneys.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He was returned to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers call preposterous and vindictive.\nThe Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the 30-year-old married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He denies the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution. Immigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to the smuggling charges.\nHere's the latest:\nWho is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?\nKilmar Abrego Garcia’s story begins in his native El Salvador, but it’s become increasingly unclear where it will end.\nA local gang, Barrio 18, began extorting his family for “rent money.” When he was 12, the gang threatened to take Abrego Garcia away until his father paid “all of the money that they wanted.”\nAbrego Garcia eventually fled to the U.S. illegally around 2011, the year he turned 16, according to documents in his immigration case. He found work in construction.\nIn March 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot seeking work as a laborer when he and three other men were detained by local police, court records say. They were suspected of being in MS-13 based on tattoos and clothing, according to the records.\nAbrego Garcia became a flash point in Trump’s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The latest filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\nThe smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.\nOn Friday, Abrego Garcia returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs.

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia taken into ICE custody, facing deportation to Uganda\nWashington — Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.\nAbrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.\nAbrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.\n\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"\nSandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"\nThe U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The order will remain in effect until 4 p.m. Wednesday unless Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, extends it. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.\nThe Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.\n\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.\nIn a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His attorneys said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.\n\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.\nSandoval-Moshenberg said an ICE officer did not answer when asked about the reason for Abrego Garcia's detention and would not say which detention center he would be taken to, or commit to providing paperwork.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"\n\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring Ábrego García back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda — to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"\nAn immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\""

      "text": "🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nPresident Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi escalated their rhetoric Monday following the detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia by immigration authorities. Speaking from the Oval Office, both officials framed Garcia's case as emblematic of broader failures in the justice system and vowed to pursue his removal.\nWhat to Know:\n- Trump said Abrego Garcia is \"very bad for votes\" and blamed \"liberal courts\" for shielding him.\n- Bondi declared Garcia \"will no longer terrorize our country\" and called for his imprisonment.\n- The remarks came after ICE detained Garcia amid renewed deportation efforts.\n- Garcia's legal team is fighting removal to Uganda, citing fears of persecution.\n- The administration has portrayed Garcia as a public safety threat, though he has not been convicted of violent crimes.\n- Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March and returned to the U.S. in June.\n- He was released on Friday ahead of a January trial on federal human smuggling charges.\n- DHS notified his lawyers Saturday of possible deportation to Uganda within 72 business hours.\nStay with Newsweek for the latest updates.\nTrump signs order targeting flag burning\nTrump signed an executive order on Monday directing federal prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against individuals who burn American flags during protests.\nThe order instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to examine whether flag burners can be charged under alternative statutes, such as disturbing the peace or violating environmental laws. Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, called the court's decision \"very sad\" and claimed flag burning incites unrest.\nThe administration's push to criminalize the act comes amid polling that shows growing public opposition to flag burning. Legal experts say the order is likely to face constitutional challenges, given the precedent set in Texas v. Johnson, which invalidated flag-burning bans in 48 states.\nTrump: 'These people are deranged'\n\"They think he's going to be good for votes, and I think he's very bad for votes,\" Trump said today when asked about Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\"These people are deranged,\" he continued. \"He's not good for votes. He beat the hell out of his wife. His wife is afraid to even talk about it. She's been mauled by this animal.\n\"And, you know, through a system of liberal courts, he's doing things, but no, we have that under control.\"\nTrump then referred to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who repeated: \"We've got him under control.\"\nTrump defends DC crackdown, denies dictator label\nTrump pushed back against criticism of his law enforcement tactics in Washington, D.C., telling reporters Monday that some Americans \"maybe like a dictator.\" He rejected the label, saying, \"I'm not a dictator. I'm a man with great common sense.\"\nThe remarks came amid growing backlash over the administration's deployment of armed National Guard troops in the capital.\nTrump also reiterated threats to send troops into Chicago, part of a broader effort to expand federal policing in major cities. Critics have accused the administration of overreach and undermining local authority.\nTrump opens public safety event with media criticism\nDuring a scheduled Oval Office event on public safety, President Donald Trump shifted focus to a sharp critique of the press, accusing reporters of biased coverage and political hostility. He claimed the media publishes \"purposely negative stories\" and suggested journalists privately support his law enforcement policies but won't admit it publicly due to \"radical left\" leanings.\nTrump also argued that media influence has waned, pointing to his electoral success despite unfavorable reporting. \"Many of you are corrupt,\" he said, \"but we keep winning.\"\nVan Hollen slams ice over detention of Abrego Garcia\nSenator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) issued a sharp rebuke Monday of the Trump administration's handling of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case, following the Salvadoran national's detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nVan Hollen accused federal officials of withholding information from Garcia's legal team and spreading false claims about his background. He called on the administration to stop making public accusations and instead present its case in court.\n\"While ICE is holding Kilmar Ábrego García and keeping his lawyers in the dark as to what is next for him, Administration officials continue to spread lies about the facts in his case,\" he said. \"Instead of spewing unproven allegations in the press and social media, the Trump Administration needs to put up or shut up in court and allow Mr. Ábrego García the opportunity to defend himself. That is the right to due process that he and everyone else living in America is afforded by our Constitution, and we will keep fighting to ensure that right is honored.\"\nAbrego Garcia open to Costa Rica refugee deal, lawyer says\nKilmar Abrego Garcia is willing to leave the United States and accept refugee status in Costa Rica, according to his attorney. The offer aligns with a previously proposed plea deal from the Trump administration, which would have allowed Garcia to plead guilty to federal charges and be deported to the Central American country.\nGarcia's legal team says the alternative—rejection of the deal—would trigger efforts to deport him to Uganda, a country where Spanish is not widely spoken and where they argue he could face serious risks.\nThe administration's push to send Garcia to East Africa has drawn criticism from rights advocates and sparked legal challenges over due process and safety concerns.\nCourt filing pauses Uganda deportation for Abrego Garcia\nKilmar Abrego Garcia's legal team filed a habeas corpus petition Monday morning in Maryland federal court, triggering a temporary halt to his deportation under a standing judicial order. The rule, issued in May by the state's chief federal judge, bars the government from deporting immigrants for 48 business hours after such petitions are filed.\nThe emergency motion seeks to block Abrego Garcia's removal to Uganda, arguing that the Trump administration re-arrested him without allowing him to raise concerns about potential persecution or torture. The filing marks the latest legal maneuver in a high-profile immigration case that has drawn national attention and intensified scrutiny of federal deportation practices.\nDHS defends Uganda deportation plan in online thread targeting Abrego Garcia\nThe Department of Homeland Security launched a public thread Monday morning detailing its case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national arrested by ICE and now facing deportation to Uganda. The agency's official account accused Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, a human trafficker, domestic abuser, and child predator—allegations his legal team has repeatedly denied.\nThe posts followed Secretary Kristi Noem's announcement that Garcia had been taken into custody in Maryland and was being processed for removal. DHS said Garcia was validated as an MS-13 member by local police in 2019 and cited a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee as evidence of suspected human trafficking. The thread also referenced past domestic violence allegations and court filings related to inappropriate communications with a minor.\nGarcia's attorneys say the government is retaliating against him for challenging his wrongful deportation earlier this year and have filed a federal lawsuit to block his removal to Uganda. The DHS thread drew immediate backlash from immigrant rights advocates, who accused the administration of using social media to smear Garcia and bypass due process.\nUganda agrees to accept U.S. deportees under new deal\nUganda has agreed to accept third-country nationals deported from the United States, becoming the latest nation to participate in President Donald Trump's expanded removal strategy. The deal, confirmed by Uganda's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, allows Washington to transfer migrants who refuse to return to their home countries—under conditions that exclude individuals with criminal records or unaccompanied minors.\nThe agreement follows similar arrangements with Eswatini, Rwanda, and South Sudan, and comes as Uganda faces steep U.S. tariffs on key exports like coffee and vanilla, Al Jazeera reports. While the details of what Uganda may receive in return remain unclear, analysts suggest trade incentives could be part of the negotiations.\nRights groups have condemned the policy, warning that deporting vulnerable individuals to countries with limited human rights protections may violate international law. Critics also argue that the deals treat African nations as political bargaining chips, with legal experts likening the practice to human trafficking.\nUganda, which already hosts over 1.7 million refugees, has long been praised for its open-door asylum policy. But opposition lawmakers say the U.S. deal could bolster President Yoweri Museveni's standing ahead of the 2026 elections, despite concerns over political repression and civil liberties.\nThe Trump administration has defended the agreements as necessary to enforce immigration laws and protect national security. Deportees have already been sent to countries including El Salvador, South Sudan, and Eswatini, often under controversial circumstances.\nAbrego Garcia files federal lawsuit to block Uganda deportation\nKilmar Abrego Garcia has filed a new federal habeas corpus petition in Maryland, challenging the Trump administration's plan to deport him to Uganda.\nWhile the filing remains sealed, his attorney confirmed the lawsuit aims to stop what they describe as a coercive and retaliatory removal effort.\nAdvocates condemn federal deportation push against Abrego Garcia\nImmigrant rights group CASA sharply criticized the federal government Monday for its handling of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case, calling him a \"martyr\" for resisting what they describe as illegal deportation practices.\n\"Kilmar is being made an example of,\" said Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, CASA's chief of organizing and leadership, in a press release. \"They're throwing the entire federal apparatus at one father of three to prove that no one should dare challenge their authority.\"\nThe statement comes amid growing backlash over the Trump administration's efforts to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, despite ongoing legal proceedings and public support from elected officials. CASA called the government's actions \"torturous\" and demanded an immediate end to what it views as retaliatory enforcement.\nNoem: 'President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien...to terrorize American citizens any longer'\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem shared a statement on the arrest of Abrego Garcia.\nFederal officials allege Garcia is affiliated with the MS-13 gang and accuse him of human trafficking, domestic abuse, and child exploitation. Secretary Noem said the arrest reflects the Trump administration's commitment to removing individuals deemed dangerous to public safety.\n\"Today, ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia and are processing him for deportation,\" said Secretary Kristi Noem. \"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator, to terrorize American citizens any longer.\"\nTrump to sign order targeting D.C.'s cashless bail policy\nTrump is expected to sign an executive order Monday aimed at ending Washington, D.C.'s longstanding cashless bail system, according to a senior White House official. The order would pressure the district to abandon the policy by threatening to withhold federal funding and project approvals.\nThe directive also calls for suspects arrested in D.C. to be placed in federal custody rather than local detention, further expanding federal control over the city's criminal justice process.\nD.C. has operated under a cashless bail framework since 1992, allowing judges to release defendants pretrial based on risk assessments rather than financial conditions. Critics of Trump's move say eliminating the policy could disproportionately harm low-income residents and undermine judicial discretion.\nThe order follows a series of aggressive federal actions in the capital, including arming National Guard troops and threatening deployments to other cities. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office declined to comment on the pending order.\nWhat did Kilmar Abrego Garcia do?\nThe Trump administration accuses Kilmar Abrego Garcia of being a member of MS-13, a transnational criminal gang designated as a terrorist organization. The allegation stems from a 2019 police encounter in Maryland, where officers cited his clothing, tattoos, and a confidential source as indicators of gang affiliation. Abrego Garcia denies the claim, and his attorneys argue that the evidence is speculative and uncorroborated. He has never been convicted of gang-related activity in the U.S. or El Salvador.\nIn 2025, Abrego Garcia was indicted on federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee after being stopped while transporting several passengers. He pleaded not guilty, and his legal team says he was driving construction workers between job sites. No trafficking charges were filed at the time of the stop.\nA domestic violence allegation also surfaced in 2021, when his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order claiming physical abuse. She later withdrew the petition, stating the couple had resolved the matter privately through counseling. Vasquez Sura continues to support her husband publicly and denies any gang involvement.\nDespite these allegations, Abrego Garcia was granted protection from deportation to El Salvador in 2019 due to threats from rival gang Barrio-18. He has complied with immigration check-ins since then and maintains that he poses no danger to the community. His legal team argues that the government's efforts to deport him—particularly to Uganda—are retaliatory and politically motivated.\nWho is Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wife?\nJennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen and wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has been a vocal advocate for his return since his wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March 2025.\nThe couple is raising three children together.\nHer public efforts have drawn attention to the family's struggle and the broader implications of U.S. immigration policy.\nAbout Abrego Garcia's possible Uganda deportation\nKilmar Abrego Garcia could be deported to Uganda, the Associated Press reported on Saturday, citing a court filing.\nThe Salvadoran man, who was mistakenly sent to the high-security CECOT prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration in March, was returned to the United States in June following a lengthy court battle to face the human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.\nHe was then held in pre-trial detention in Tennessee, from which he was released on Friday.\nFollowing his release, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told CBS News. He declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica, which offered to receive him, so officials have turned to Uganda, which has agreed to receive deportees although preferably \"individuals from African countries.\"\nNewsweek has contacted the DHS for comment via email.\nAbrego García detained by ice at Baltimore check-in\nKilmar Abrego García was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Monday morning after reporting to the agency's Baltimore field office, according to his attorney. The check-in was part of the conditions of his release pending trial on federal human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\nAbrego García, a Maryland construction worker, had been released from criminal custody on Friday after months of legal battles stemming from what his lawyers describe as a wrongful deportation to El Salvador earlier this year. His legal team has accused the government of retaliatory tactics, including efforts to deport him to Uganda before his trial begins.\nTo read how Newsweek uses AI as a newsroom tool, Click here."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia detained at ICE office in Maryland\nThe Salvadoran native is facing possible deportation to Uganda.\nKilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported in March before being brought back to the U.S. to face new criminal charges, was taken into immigration custody after checking in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement at its office in Baltimore on Monday morning, his attorney said.\nAbrego Garcia was detained as soon as he entered ICE's office, attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\"We asked the ICE officer what the reason for his detention was, the ICE officer didn't answer,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said, adding that ICE officers would not say which detention center his client would be taken to.\n\"We asked the ICE officer for a copy of any paperwork that's being served on him today, the ICE officer wouldn't commit to even giving us that paperwork,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\nLess than 24 hours after being released from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday, ICE notified Abrego Garcia's attorneys that he may be deported to Uganda and ordered him to report to their office in Maryland.\nThe notification from ICE came after Abrego Garcia rejected a plea deal to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and remaining in jail, according to a court filing from his attorneys.\nIn the filing, Abrego Garcia's attorneys accused the federal government of trying to force their client to accept a guilty plea or face deportation to East Africa.\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which his family and attorneys deny.\nHe was brought back to the U.S. in June to face charges in Tennessee of allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. while he was living in Maryland. He has pleaded not guilty.\nIn July, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered that, should he be released while awaiting trial, Abrego Garcia be placed under ICE supervision in Maryland, where he was living with his wife and children before he was mistakenly deported in March, \"to \"provide the kind of effective relief to which a wrongfully removed alien is entitled upon return.\"\nXinis also said that if the government intends to deport Abrego Garcia to a third country, it needs to provide 72 hours' notice.\nThe order allowed the Trump administration to initiate \"lawful immigration proceedings\" when Abrego Garcia returned to Maryland. The immigration proceedings may or may not include \"lawful arrest, detention and eventual removal,\" Xinis said in July.\nIn a habeas lawsuit filed Monday morning, Abrego Garcia's lawyers accused the federal government of taking him into custody without providing him the right to be heard \"on his expressed fears of persecution and torture\" should he be deported to Uganda.\n\"Respondents are seeking to remove Petitioner to Uganda -- a process which they know will trigger lengthy legal proceedings -- rather than Costa Rica -- the country for removal designated by Petitioner that offered him resettlement -- in order to punish him for his constitutionally protected activity,\" the attorneys said in the filing.\nThe attorneys allege the government is seeking to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda instead of Costa Rica for \"refusing to plead guilty in his criminal proceedings\" in Tennessee.\n\"In so doing, Respondents know and intend for Petitioner to be detained by ICE for a lengthy period of time, even though a removal to Costa Rica could be effectuated with little or no ICE detention at all, and Respondents seek to use ICE detention to punish Petitioner,\" the filing states.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland shortly after Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE, requests that the court block the government from detaining Abrego Garcia \"more than 200 miles\" from the courthouse in Baltimore.\nThe attorneys are also asking the court to block the government from removing Abrego Garcia to Uganda without first attempting to remove him to Costa Rica.\nThey also ask the court to order the government to allow Abrego Garcia to have a \"reasonable fear\" interview before their client is deported to Uganda."

      "text": "BALTIMORE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who reunited with his family last week after 160 days apart following his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, was taken into ICE custody on Monday after an immigration check-in, his attorney said.\nThe check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore was part of the conditions of his release from federal custody on parole on Friday.\nWhile such meetings are usually routine and are meant for case updates, Abrego's attorneys said they expected he would be taken into ICE custody during the check-in after the Trump administration announced over the weekend its intention to deport him to Uganda.\n\"There was no need to take him into ICE detention. ... The only reason they took him into detention was to punish him,\" for using his constitutional right to speak up and fight proceedings, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego's attorneys, said Monday morning.\nSandoval-Moshenberg said on Friday that a notice said the 8 a.m. meeting on Monday would be for an interview.\n\"Clearly that was false,\" he added.\nHe said lawyers asked ICE officers why Abrego was taken into custody, and the officers would not answer. The ICE officers would also not give information as to where Abrego is going, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a matter that is completely unconstitutional, and specifically weaponizing the decision of which country they send him to,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\nWhat we know about Abrego Garcia's case\n- Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what officials described as an “administrative error.”\n- In April, a judge ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego — spurring a legal back-and-forth that involved the Supreme Court.\n- Abrego was returned to the U.S. on June 6, following an indictment in a federal court in Nashville. The indictment charged Abrego with transporting within the U.S. people who were not legally in the country.\n- He was released from federal custody on parole on Friday and had a tearful reunion with his family after months apart. Minutes after his release, immigration authorities notified Abrego that they intend to deport him to Uganda.\n- Separately, the Trump administration offered him a plea deal that would ensure his eventual deportation to Costa Rica.\nThe White House confirmed Monday's arrest and said ICE officials are \"processing him for deportation.\" The White House X account did not offer more details about Abrego's future.\nSandoval-Moshenberg said Monday that Abgrego has filed a new lawsuit in federal district court for the district of Maryland \"seeking to ensure that he is not removed from the United States pending his immigration proceedings.\"\nThe lawsuit asks for an order from a Maryland federal judge that Abrego not be allowed to be removed from the United States, unless he is given proper due process to fight his potential deportation.\nThe suit challenges Abrego's deportation to Uganda or any other country unless and until he's had a fair trial, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. He later argued that deporting his client to any country without any credible assurances that he can stay there would be \"just a very inconvenient layover to El Salvador.\"\nAbrego spoke at a news conference before heading into his ICE appointment on Monday morning, surrounded by family, supporters, faith leaders and his legal team, who were all calling for his freedom.\n\"My name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this, remember that I am free and I was able to be reunited with my family,\" he said in Spanish before a translator repeated in English.\n\"This was a miracle. Thank you to God and thank you to the community,\" Abrego added. \"I want to thank each and every one of you who marched, lift your voices, never stop praying and continue to fight in my name.\"\nIt's the latest move by the government to boot Abrego from the country after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a 2019 court order. After much legal resistance, Abrego was returned to the U.S. in June and hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee, which he pleaded not guilty to.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a gang member part of the notorious MS-13, which his attorneys have denied. Abrego’s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.\nThe Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal last week, his lawyers said in a Saturday court filing that was part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be \"vindictive\" and \"selective\" prosecution.\nIf he pleads guilty to the federal charges out of Tennessee and serves time, he can be deported to Costa Rica. The Costa Rican government said he'd live as a free man there, according to the filing.\nBefore Monday morning's appointment, Sandoval-Moshenberg said his client would not be taking the plea deal as Abrego \"will not accept charges of which he's not guilty.\" This means the agreement to be deported to Costa Rica could be off the table.\nAbrego's attorneys rebuffed the Trump administration's apparent attempt to strong-arm him.\n\"What they’re trying to do here is punish him. They’re trying to use the deportation system, and specifically, they’re trying to use which country they’re planning on deporting him to as a means of punishing him for exercising his constitutional rights,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Saturday outside Abrego's brother's home in Maryland.\nGary Grumbach reported from Baltimore, Marlene Lenthang from Los Angeles, and Rebecca Cohen from New York."

The detention comes three days after the undocumented immigrant was freed after a federal judge determined he did not pose a flight risk or danger to the community. Trump officials had insisted Abrego would “never go free” in the United States. Maria Sacchetti, Jeremy Roebuck and Dana Munro/The Washington Post. (See related articles below.)\nMOORE SLAMS TRUMP; TRUMP SUGGESTS PULLING FUNDS FROM KEY BRIDGE: President Donald Trump clapped back at Gov. Wes Moore on Sunday, threatening to “send in the troops” to Baltimore in a lengthy social media post. The outburst saw Trump mock Moore’s offer for him to “walk the streets” of Baltimore, suggest he could pull federal funding for the reconstruction of the Key Bridge, and imply that Moore lied about receiving a Bronze Star for his service in the Army. He received the honor this past winter. Carson Swick/The Baltimore Sun.\n- Moore said that President Trump’s military deployment in Washington, D.C., is “not sustainable” and “unconstitutional,” adding that he would not authorize deployment of National Guard troops from Maryland to D.C. Margaret Brennan/Face The Nation.\n- Trump threatened Sunday morning to revisit the federal government’s decision to fully fund the Key Bridge replacement and to send the military to Baltimore. The threats, posted to Trump’s Truth Social platform, are a sharp escalation in the back-and-forth between the president and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore in recent weeks. Lee O. Sanderlin/The Baltimore Banner.\n- Trump ended his missive by noting that “I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge. I will now have to rethink that decision???” an apparent reference to a Congress-approved commitment to fully fund replacement for the Key Bridge after it was destroyed in a crash with a container ship last year. Staff/Maryland Matters.\nTRUMP COULD AGGRAVATE PROGRESS MADE IN B’MORE, ADVOCATES SAY: Advocates and officials discussed the task of police reform amid threats of a takeover by federal law enforcement at a town hall Saturday. The event, hosted by Baltimore’s Police Accountability Board and Office of Equity and Civil Rights, aimed to discuss the shift from reactive to proactive community policing and handling of behavioral health crises. But panelists were quick to point out that the Trump administration’s funding cuts and domineering may aggravate the challenges they face.

Katie Shepherd/The Washington Post.\nTRUMP CRUSADE AGAINST RENEWABLE ENERGY WEAKENS STATE OBJECTIVES: After four years of state and federal alignment on energy policy, Maryland is on defense against the Trump administration’s crusade against renewable energy projects in favor of fossil fuels. Executive actions and new laws are undermining the state’s plan for a clean energy future as Maryland faces growing demands on its electrical grid. Ben Mause/The Baltimore Sun.\nMATH GRADES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS DROP: From wealthy suburbs to rural hillsides, Maryland public school students on average aren’t great at math. It wasn’t always so. Back in 2009, Maryland’s eighth graders significantly outperformed the national average on the country’s most rigorous math test, called the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Liz Bowie/The Baltimore Banner.\n****TRUMP ADMIN INTENDS TO DEPORT ABREGO GARCIA TO UGANDA: The Trump administration intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said. Anita Wadhwani/Maryland Matters.\n- ICE told Garcia to report to the Baltimore field office Monday morning as it plans to deport him to Uganda. The Salvadoran native and Beltsville resident, once wrongfully deported then returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges, was released from pretrial detention in Tennessee and allowed to return to his family in Maryland only Friday.

John-John Williams/The Baltimore Banner.\nADVOCATES SAY NEW STORMWATER PERMIT MISSED THE MARK: A new stormwater permit meant to control runoff of polluted rainwater from state roads into state waterways is a “critical missed opportunity,” according to environmental groups, who say the new guidelines backtrack from previous requirements. The five-year permit sets a requirement of controlling runoff on more than 4,000 acres owned by State Highway Administration, which is backed up by $216 million in combined state and federal funding, officials said.

Wes Moore answered in the affirmative. “Yeah, and I think we have to,” Moore told CBS News anchor Margaret Brennan during his appearance on “Face The Nation” Sunday morning. Moore drew parallels between the GOP’s redistricting strategy and President Donald Trump’s call urging Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes” to help overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.\nCrowd yells ‘shame!’\nAbrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.\n“This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,” Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. “God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.”\nRoughly 200 people had gathered and prayed in front of the Baltimore field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some held signs with messages such as “Stop Detaining Our Neighbors” and “Free Kilmar.”\nWith Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: “The people united will never be defeated.”\nThe crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled “Shame!”\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office that Abrego Garcia “will no longer terrorize our country.”\nBut Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration’s removal attempts.\n“I expect there’s going to be a status conference very promptly, and we’re going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,” he said.\nReunion with family\nAbrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.\nThe Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.\nAbrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them “for everything.”\n‘Hold Abrego Garcia accountable’\nImmigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.\nFilings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face detention.\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a “clear danger” and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.\n“Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,” Gilmartin said.\nThe U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the United States in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, calling it an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\nThe smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.\nA recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.\n“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.\n___\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Abrego Garcia is being sent to Uganda, a country with a language he doesn’t speak. Uganda’s official language is English."

The order applies to immigrants in Maryland who are challenging their detention.\nAbrego Garcia, a 30-year-old Maryland construction worker and Salvadoran national, spoke at a rally before he turned himself in.\n\"This administration has hit us hard, but I want to tell you guys something: God is with us, and God will never leave us,\" Abrego Garcia said, speaking through a translator. \"God will bring justice to all the injustice we are suffering.\"\nRoughly 200 people had gathered and prayed in front of the Baltimore field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some held signs with messages such as \"Stop Detaining Our Neighbors\" and \"Free Kilmar.\"\nWith Abrego Garcia and his wife standing before them, the crowd spoke in unison: \"The people united will never be defeated.\"\nThe crowd waited outside after Abrego Garcia entered the federal building. When his lawyer and wife walked out without him after his detainment, the crowd yelled \"Shame!\"\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was being processed for deportation. But Abrego Garcia's lead immigration attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said lawyers will fight the administration's removal attempts.\n\"I expect there's going to be a status conference very promptly, and we're going to ask for an interim order that he not be deported, pending his due process rights to contest deportation to any particular country,\" he said.\nAbrego Garcia was wrongfully deported in March to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face human smuggling charges that his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.\nThe Trump administration has said it is trying to deport Abrego Garcia months before his trial is scheduled in Tennessee, alleging that the married father is a danger to the community and an MS-13 gang member. He has denied the gang allegation, pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges and has asked a judge to dismiss the case on ground of vindictive prosecution.\nAbrego Garcia was released Friday afternoon from a jail in Tennessee and returned to his family in Maryland. Video released by advocates of the reunion showed a room decorated with streamers, flowers and signs. He embraced loved ones and thanked them \"for everything.\"\nImmigration officials have said they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, which recently agreed to accept certain deportees from the U.S. He declined an offer to be removed to Costa Rica in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges.\nFilings in federal court show the Costa Rican government saying Abrego Garcia would be welcomed as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face detention.\nIn a statement, Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin said the criminal charges underscore how Abrego Garcia presents a \"clear danger\" and that he can either plead guilty or stand trial.\n\"Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people,\" Gilmartin said.\nThe U.S. mistakenly deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a \"well-founded fear\" of violence there.

His lawyers have argued that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\nThe smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nAbrego Garcia has an American wife and children and has lived in Maryland for years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, he remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.\nA recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours' notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.\n\"Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),\" it states. Uganda recently agreed to take deportees from the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who became a symbol of Trump’s anti-immigrant crackdown when the administration illegally sent him to El Salvador earlier this year, is at risk of being deported again — this time to Uganda, a country he has no ties to.\nAbrego Garcia was one of hundreds of men sent to El Salvador in March to be jailed in that country’s brutal CECOT mega-prison, despite a court order specifically meant to prevent his deportation. After initially claiming no power to return Abrego Garcia, the administration brought him back in June to face human smuggling charges that his legal team has condemned as retaliation. He was released Friday from federal detention in Tennessee and allowed to rejoin his wife and three children in Maryland pending trial, but the administration immediately informed his lawyers of their intention to begin new deportation proceedings to Uganda. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody again Monday morning.\n“Clearly, the Trump administration is sort of making this all up as they go along,” says Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and a lawyer for Abrego Garcia’s family. He accuses President Trump of using “the highest office in this land to railroad and prosecute and punish an innocent man.”\nTranscript\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman.\nWe turn now to a case that’s become a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign and crackdown on immigrants. We’re talking about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 30-year-old father from El Salvador who lived in Maryland for years. He was detained by federal immigration officials again today, just days after he was reunited with his wife and children in Maryland after being separated from them for more than 160 days.\nThis morning, Abrego Garcia presented himself to ICE for a check-in. Dozens of his supporters rallied outside ICE’s office in Baltimore, where he addressed the crowd before walking into the building, where he was taken into custody. He spoke in Spanish, followed by a translator.\nKILMAR ABREGO GARCIA: [translated] And this is why I want to thank each and every one of you, who marched, lifted your voices, never stopped praying and continued to fight in my name.\nAMY GOODMAN: Kilmar had just returned home Friday, after he was released from jail in Tennessee. The father of three still faces deportation, this time to Uganda, a country he has no connection to. The Trump administration threatened to send him there for refusing to plead guilty in a human smuggling case that Kilmar’s legal team has condemned as retaliation for challenging his initial wrongful removal to El Salvador and for his refusal to accept a plea deal that would have seen him sent to Costa Rica after the completion of his prison sentence.\nKilmar Abrego Garcia’s anguish began in March, when he was wrongfully sent to El Salvador’s notorious maximum-security CECOT mega-prison along with 260 other immigrants in the United States without due process. A court order forced his return to the U.S. in June. He was visited there by a number of politicians, including Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen. But upon his return, the Trump administration arrested and indicted Abrego Garcia on alleged human smuggling charges, for which he awaits a federal trial. His lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the case based on vindictive and selective prosecution.\nFor more, we go to a lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s family, Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, known NDLON.\nChris, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you explain these latest developments of the last few days?\nCHRIS NEWMAN: Boy, I mean, like the whole saga, it’s been a whirlwind. You know, I’m anxiously looking at my phone. I’m Zooming in to you live here from California, talking to colleagues on the East Coast. And yes, Kilmar was just apprehended. He was released from jail in Tennessee, returned home to his family and reported dutifully to his ICE check-in this morning and was apprehended.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, explain, after he was held in El Salvador, first at CECOT and then another prison, the more than 200 people sent from the United States there — more than 200 were sent to Venezuela. This was all clearly illegal, being held in El Salvador. He came back to the United States but was immediately imprisoned. Explain what he’s charged with. And is it possible that they’re talking about sending him to Uganda, a country he has no connection to?\nCHRIS NEWMAN: Well, I mean, the legal charges and legal maneuvers that are being deployed against Kilmar are unprecedented and almost defy description, because they are so unprecedented. The strategy has been incoherent from the Trump administration from the beginning. But the political strategy is clear as day. They are seeking to use the highest office in this land to railroad and prosecute and punish an innocent man.\nAnd, you know, again, words escape us. He was never — you know, he wasn’t deported to El Salvador. I think the better and more appropriate term is that he was “renditioned.” This is a guy that has never been convicted of anything. And I think it’s actually important to consistently put this case in context. You know, you say that his nightmare started in March. It actually preceded that, when he was wrongfully arrested while looking for work at a Home Depot, much like, you know, people are being arrested every day in Los Angeles. The difference is, in Los Angeles, if you get arrested by local police, you’re protected by sanctuary laws, which prohibit police and ICE from being — you know, from collaborating. Kilmar was wrongfully arrested by local police — in fact, he was arrested by a police officer who himself pled guilty to criminal wrongdoing — but was then transferred into ICE custody, where he functionally won his case. He won something called withholding of removal, saying that he can’t go back to the country that he fled from.\nHe was then, as you pointed out, wrongfully apprehended during that big, really awful moment in American history where hundreds of people were renditioned to the biggest and worst prison in the hemisphere. When he was brought in there, he was told, like everyone else, that he was never leaving. And, you know, he was, in fact, one of the few — very, very few — people to ever leave CECOT, and certainly one of the few people to at least momentarily be a free man, as he was over the weekend.\nWhat comes next, honestly, is anyone’s guess at this point, because clearly the Trump administration is sort of making this all up as they go along. And we are going to do everything we can in court, in this country, in other countries, if necessary, to make sure that Kilmar is ultimately reunited with his family and is able to live a free and prosperous life.\nAMY GOODMAN: This just in: Kilmar Abrego Garcia has filed a new federal lawsuit in Maryland. Since it’s a habeas corpus case, the petition isn’t public, but his lawyers said it challenges the Trump administration’s scheme to send him to Uganda. I also want to quote Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who spoke with Kilmar and his wife yesterday, on Sunday. In response to his threats, Trump’s threats to send Kilmar to Uganda, Senator Van Hollen said in a statement, quote, “Kilmar Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court. But Trump Administration officials — who continue to make public statements about his case that have been expressly repudiated by the courts — would rather insult judges and circumvent our justice system than uphold people’s constitutional rights.” Your response, Chris?\nCHRIS NEWMAN: Well, right from the start, when the senator and I were momentarily detained in El Salvador, Senator Van Hollen has said that this is a test case for due process for everyone. And part of the reason why the senator, I think, has been and continues to be so invested in the outcome of this case is not only because, you know, he’s convinced that we’re experiencing a grave injustice for Kilmar and his family, but also because all of our rights are currently under threat. And so, one way to look at this is that this is, you know, a high-profile deportation case. The other way to look at it is that this is a high-profile test case as to whether or not we have due process at all in this country.\nAnd so, you know, when Kilmar said earlier today that he’s grateful for those that have been standing with him, I want to echo that sentiment and say this is far from over, and it’s going to be incumbent upon, you know, not just his lawyers to make every argument, including the habeas petition filed just now, but it’s going to be incumbent upon anyone who believes in due process and the constitutional system and constitutional values in this country to accompany him, because he right now is not only defending himself and his family, but he’s defending all of us.\nAMY GOODMAN: His lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, says the stated intention of the meeting with immigration police today was for an interview, but clearly that was false, the lawyer says. He said ICE did not say why they were detaining him or where they are taking him. Your final comment, Chris Newman?\nCHRIS NEWMAN: Look, we’ve been on a slippery slope in this country for years, in which, you know, debates of — the course in debate about immigration has been used as a pretext and mechanism for incipient authoritarianism. The fact is, is that Kilmar fled El Salvador, made a great life here in this country, contributed to his community, and now has the types of authoritarian human rights violations that he was fleeing from in El Salvador following him here to the United States. And so, Donald Trump wants to close the border for immigrants, but he seems to be importing authoritarian legal and political techniques into this country. And thankfully, Kilmar and his family are standing up.\nAnd I will share with you what I shared with him and his family yesterday when we spoke. On behalf of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, we plan to stand with him every step of the way, until his civil and human rights are vindicated. And this is now, obviously, a major setback, but we’re going to continue this fight to the very end, because it’s important not just for him, but for all of us.\nAnd I will say, again, there was a fleeting moment of joy when he was able to be with his family, and I think that that gave a lot of people hope, particularly in Los Angeles, because we’re seeing apprehensions and human rights violations at Home Depots every single day in Los Angeles, akin to the kinds of things that are happening to Kilmar. And I think the way Kilmar and his family have fought back have been an inspiration not just to the country, but to every day laborer in the United States.\nAMY GOODMAN: Chris Newman, I want to thank you for being with us, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, NDLON, lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s family, actually speaking to us from California.\nSpeaking of fighting back, we turn now to George Retes, a disabled 25-year-old U.S. citizen and Army veteran held by ICE for three days and nights without charge. We’ll find out what he’s doing about it. Back in 20 seconds.\n[break]\nAMY GOODMAN: “Envy” by Lila Downs, performing in our Democracy Now! studio.\nMedia Options"

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia faces deportation to Uganda after release from Tennessee jail\nKilmar Abrego Garcia faces deportation to Uganda less than 24 hours after his release from a Tennessee jail, according to a Saturday court filing.\nCheers and smiles marked Abrego Garcia's reunion with his family after 160 days apart.\n\"Today is such a special day because, after 160 days, I am able to see my family again,\" Abrego Garcia said Friday through an interpreter.\nHowever, the joy was short-lived as immigration officials informed his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda shortly after his release from a Putnam County, Tennessee, jail.\nAbrego Garcia had previously turned down an offer to be deported to Costa Rica, where he would be accepted as a legal immigrant, in exchange for pleading guilty to human smuggling charges and staying in jail.\n\"The issue here is that Kilmar deserves full liberation,\" said Jossie Sapunar, the national communications director with CASA, an advocacy organization that has been supporting Abrego Garcia and his family. \"Kilmar deserves access to his rights, and nothing should get in the way of that.\"\nAbrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to CECOT, a mega prison in El Salvador, in March. A Supreme Court order in April forced the Trump administration to bring him back to the U.S. in June.\nThat's when he was federally charged in Tennessee with human smuggling, to which, he pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the case, saying it was a punishment for challenging his deportation to El Salvador.\nThe human smuggling charge stems from a 2022 traffic stop, when a Tennessee highway patrolman stopped the car Abrego Garcia was driving for speeding and suspected human trafficking. Abrego Garcia was not charged at that time.\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys argue that the latest threat to deport him to Uganda is further proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\n\"It is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn't even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options,\" said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney. \"This family has suffered enough ... We're going to fight tooth and nail against that.\"\nSandoval-Moshenberg told 11 News he believes that Costa Rica is a reasonable option for Abrego Garcia's deportation since it's a Spanish-speaking country and closer to the United States.\nA Justice Department spokesperson released a statement, saying: \"A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes ... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.\"\nAbrego Garcia has a check-in scheduled Monday morning at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office, before which, CASA plans to hold a prayer vigil for him.\nSapunar and her team hope Abrego Garcia can stay with his family.\n\"Monday's ICE check-in comes with fear, of course, but frankly, this family has been ready to fight for Kilmar's freedom,\" Sapunar told 11 News.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, released a statement, saying: \"Kilmar Abrego García deserves his day in court, but Trump Administration officials — who continue to make public statements about his case that have been expressly repudiated by the courts — would rather insult judges and circumvent our justice system than uphold people's constitutional rights.\"\nThe office of Maryland U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-District 1, who is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, sent a statement to 11 News, saying: \"Congressman Harris supports deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia given his ties to MS-13, his history of domestic abuse and the serious criminal indictment related to human smuggling. The congressman commends ICE for enforcing immigration law and keeping American communities safe, while abiding by Mr. Garcia’s desire not to be repatriated to his native country.\"\nAbrego Garcia has lived for years in Prince George's County with his American wife and children; he immigrated to the U.S. illegally. In 2019, an immigration judge denied his application for asylum but granted him protection from being deported back to El Salvador, where he faces a \"well-founded fear\" of violence, according to court filings. He was required to check in yearly with ICE while Homeland Security issued him a work permit.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "text": "The crisis of the American legal system\nJust a reminder of who we’re dealing with:\nKilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant who was wrongfully expelled to El Salvador in March and then brought back to face criminal charges, was detained again on Monday after the administration indicated that it planned to re-deport him to Uganda, his lawyer said.\nThe detention unfolded after Mr. Abrego Garcia arrived at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore and came only three days after he was freed from custody in the criminal case that was filed against him in Federal District Court in Nashville.\nA lawyer for Mr. Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the stated intention of the meeting with ICE was for an interview. “Clearly, that was false,” he said, adding that the immigration authorities did not say why Mr. Abrego Garcia was being detained or even where he would be taken.\nShortly after Mr. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody, his lawyers filed a legal action known as a habeas petition in Federal District Court in Maryland seeking to stop his removal to Uganda. The petition claimed that the Trump administration had re-arrested him without first giving him the opportunity to express “fears of persecution and torture in that country.”\nMr. Abrego Garcia should have a grace period of two business days from being deported again under a standing order issued in May by the chief federal judge in Maryland. The order automatically stopped the government from following through on expulsions of immigrants for 48 hours after they filed habeas petitions.\nOver the weekend, his lawyers had accused the Trump administration of seeking to “coerce” a guilty plea from him on the charges of human smuggling that were brought against him in an indictment in June.\nThe lawyers said the administration had promised to send Mr. Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, where he could live freely as a legal resident, if he pleaded to the charges and agreed to serve whatever prison sentence he eventually received. Otherwise, the lawyers said, Trump officials said they would deport Mr. Abrego Garcia “halfway across the world” to Uganda, where, the lawyers said, “his safety and liberty would be under threat.”\nThe arrest in Baltimore was the latest twist in a long-running saga that began this spring, when the Trump administration removed Mr. Abrego Garcia to a notorious terrorism prison in El Salvador, despite a court order that expressly barred him from being sent to the country. Then, after weeks of complaining that they were powerless to bring him back to U.S. soil, Trump officials did exactly that — not merely to correct their own mistake but to file criminal charges against him.\nAs he arrived for his immigration check-in in Baltimore on Monday, Mr. Abrego Garcia was greeted by the cheers of dozens of supporters at the federal building in Baltimore. His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and his brother, Cesar, were by his side. Speaking in front of the crowd, he thanked the people who had stood with him and delivered an emotional plea to immigrants and the immigrant rights community to keep up the fight and not lose hope.\n“Brothers and sisters, my name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia,” he said. “And I always want you to remember that today, I can say with pride, that I am free and have been reunited with my family.”\nI’m teaching a class this semester, the first session of which is this morning, on the current crisis of the American legal system. I see this as a crisis of meaning — what and how does the law mean? — a crisis of judicial legitimacy, closely related to the first — and ultimately a crisis of liberal democracy.\nI plan to begin by announcing some bad news and good news. You can probably guess the bad news. The good news is that this is an extremely interesting topic, although perhaps most so in the sense of the proverbial (apocryphal?) Chinese curse.\nAn interesting meta-question is how one is supposed to go about teaching a class on this subject — which does seem to me to be something that ought to be touched on directly within American law schools at the moment — in a politically “neutral” way. It seems to me that political neutrality is something that’s both impossible and undesirable to maintain, in a situation in which questions such as “is liberal democracy collapsing in America?” are inherently political down to the last turtle.\nWe’ll see how it goes."
