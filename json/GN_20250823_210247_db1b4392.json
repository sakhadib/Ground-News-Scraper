But Trump has so far extended the deadline three times during his second term — with the next one coming up on Sept. 17.\n“We’re gonna watch the security concerns,” Trump told reporters, but added, “We have buyers, American-buyers,” and “until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer.”\nThe first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect.

Young people love TikTok. If we could keep it going.”\nAs the extensions continue, it appears less and less likely that TikTok will be banned in the U.S. any time soon. The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but the administration has not faced a legal challenge in court — unlike many of Trump’s other executive orders.\nAmericans are even more closely divided on what to do about TikTok than they were two years ago.\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren’t sure.\nAmong those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users’ data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report."

And to the dismay of some fans, the chain’s new logo now ditches the barrel itself.\nOr rather, the drawing many have associated with Cracker Barrel over the years. The man leaning on that barrel is also gone, as are the words “Old Country Store.” Instead, the new emblem features a simpler design with just “Cracker Barrel” written on a gold background, which also has a semi-updated shape.\n“Anchored in Cracker Barrel’s signature gold and brown tones, the updated visuals will appear across menus and marketing collateral,” the Tennessee-based company wrote in a Tuesday announcement. Cracker Barrel added that its logo is “now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all.”"

      "text": "President Trump said U.S. concerns over TikTok are exaggerated and suggested he may extend ByteDance’s deadline to sell its American assets, despite lawmakers’ security warnings.\nPresident Donald Trump has signaled he may extend the deadline for Chinese tech giant ByteDance to divest its TikTok assets in the United States.\nSpeaking to reporters on August 22, Trump downplayed national security fears surrounding the app, saying concerns had been “exaggerated” but insisted his administration was monitoring potential risks closely.\nHe added that he intends to discuss the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping “at the appropriate time,” suggesting the matter could feature in broader U.S.-China negotiations.\nThe current deadline for ByteDance to either sell or restructure its U.S. holdings has already been postponed until September 17. Trump noted there are “significant American buyers” interested in TikTok, though he declined to name them.\nLast year’s legislation requires ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or show clear progress toward a sale. However, Trump has repeatedly delayed implementation since taking office, citing diplomatic considerations and economic factors.\nThe debate reflects growing tension in Washington over Chinese ownership of TikTok. While some lawmakers argue that extending the deadline ignores mounting national security concerns, Trump insists a more measured approach is needed to avoid unnecessary disruption.\nAnalysts say Trump’s latest comments highlight the delicate balancing act between safeguarding digital security and maintaining stable economic ties with Beijing. The outcome could reshape both TikTok’s future in the U.S. and the broader trajectory of U.S.-China tech relations."

The next extension deadline is set for September 17.\n- The first extension was issued via executive order on January 20, the first day of Trump’s second term, following a brief TikTok shutdown under a national ban upheld by the Supreme Court.\n- The second extension happened in April when White House officials expected a deal to spin off TikTok to U.S. ownership; however, China backed out after Trump announced tariffs.\nGo deeper: The White House recently launched its own TikTok account, with Trump expressing positive personal sentiments, stating he used TikTok during his campaign and that young people, including his own children, enjoy the platform.\n- Public opinion on TikTok remains deeply split; a Pew Research Center survey found about one-third of Americans support banning the app, down from 50% in early 2023, with data security concerns driving most supporters of a ban.\n- No legal challenges have yet been brought against the executive orders extending TikTok’s operation, unlike other Trump administration directives."
