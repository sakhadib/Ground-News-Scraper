They are wrong. The Russians are not about to forget our support for Ukraine.\" Nate, who returned to the United States in January, continued: “We are Vladimir Putin’s useful idiots.\"\nThe Vice President's cousin apparently travelled to Ukraine just three weeks after the country was invaded in February 2022 and enlisted in the “Da Vinci Wolves” battalion, which saw action in some of the conflict's bloodiest battles to date."

Six months later, Vance parroted his boss’s assessment that it was “good TV.”\nMonday’s meeting was more cordial. The sit-down followed last Friday’s non-breakthrough summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and came before Trump’s talk with key European allies at the White House.\nVance on Wednesday credited Trump with “cut[ting] through the B.S. of many diplomatic protocols” during that gathering by calling Putin right afterward.\nWhen Trump announced his intentions, European leaders assumed he meant several days later, Vance said.\n“He was like, ‘No. What time is it in Moscow? Let’s call him right now,’” according to Vance. “One of the things I have realized about President Trump’s leadership is he cuts through the B.S. of some of these diplomatic protocols and just says ‘I’m going to get things done. If I want to talk to somebody, I’m going to talk to somebody’.”\nVance, whom Trump has given a larger role in working on a peace deal, added: “And I think that kind of no holds barred, no B.S. diplomacy is part of the reason why we have made the progress we have. And we’ve made a lot of progress.”\nAfter Friday’s summit with Putin, neither leader offered specifics about what was achieved.\nVance said the president has acknowledged there is no certainty about the outcome of negotiations until it’s done."

Inconsistencies may occur.\nVice President JD Vance told Fox News' Laura Ingraham that he greeted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with a \"little icebreaker\" during his visit to the White House this week.\nWhy It Matters\nVance's comments will likely stir debate among the president's critics and supporters, which come amid fluctuating approval ratings as the electorate responds to key policies and developments in his presidency, including his administration's handling of foreign policy.\nWhat To Know\nVance said on The Ingraham Angle, \"President Zelensky walked into the Oval Office, and I was chatting with him, and the president [Trump] and some of the senior Ukrainian delegation. I said, Mr. President, so as long as you behave, I won't say anything. And he just chuckled a little bit, and it was a good little icebreaker.\"\nDuring a February Oval Office meeting, President Trump and Vance abruptly confronted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, culminating in a public shouting match and the cancellation of a signed minerals deal after Zelensky was called \"disrespectful\" and escorted out of the White House.\nThe meeting—which had initially been intended to formalize U.S. support for Ukraine—collapsed entirely, with lunch and a joint press conference scrapped amid the dramatic fallout.\nTrump met with Zelensky and other European leaders at the White House on Monday to discuss the status of the United States' ongoing effort to broker an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which Putin launched without provocation in 2022. That meeting ended with Trump signaling an openness to some security guarantees for Ukraine, though it's unclear what that would consist of.\nWhat People Are Saying\nCalifornia Governor Newsom said in a speech last week: \"We need to stand up—not just California. Other blue states need to stand up.\"\nChristian Martinez, spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement responding to Newsom: \"Gavin Newsom's latest stunt has nothing to do with Californians and everything to do with consolidating radical Democrat power, silencing California voters, and propping up his pathetic 2028 presidential pipe dream. Newsom's made it clear: he'll shred California's Constitution and trample over democracy - running a cynical, self-serving playbook where Californians are an afterthought and power is the only priority.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe White House is hammering out the details of a possible Putin-Zelensky meeting, and Leavitt said she will share more information about the time and location when they're finalized.\nUpdate 8/20/25: This article has been updated with additional information and context.\nAbout the writer\nSonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.
