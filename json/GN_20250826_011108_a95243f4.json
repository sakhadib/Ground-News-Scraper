      "text": "Analysis: During the past year, more than a dozen countries have moved towards formally recognising the Palestinian state, as the conflict in Gaza rages on and Kiwis’ screens are bombarded with horrific images of trapped, starving children.\nThis month, New Zealand’s closest partner (and only formal ally) Australia joined that group, committing to officially recognising the state during next month’s UN General Assembly, in the hope of preserving the vision of a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza and release of the hostages held by Hamas.\nLater that same day, Foreign Minister Winston Peters confirmed New Zealand is also considering a move in that direction, but it’s not there yet.\n“Ultimately, New Zealand has an independent foreign policy, and on this issue, we intend to weigh up the issue carefully and then act according to New Zealand’s principles, values and national interest,” he said at the time.\nPeters reiterated the enduring position of successive governments in support of a two-state solution and Palestinian self-determination, where Israelis and Palestinians would be able to live peacefully side by side.\nThe question is whether Palestine can, at some point in the near-future, meet the prerequisites of a viable and legitimate state. And what impact declaring recognition of the Palestinian state will now have on whether a two-state solution is brokered between Israel and Palestine.\nAfter almost 80 years to ponder the solution to a lasting peace, it might be expected that the Government would be ready to go with an answer.\nBut it’s more complicated than that. And the three-way coalition dynamic brings additional complexities to the decision.\n“There are a broad range of strongly held views within our Government, Parliament and indeed New Zealand society over the question of recognition of a Palestinian state,” Peters said a couple of weeks ago.\nSince then, the narrative has taken hold that Act is standing in the way of the coalition making the call to formally recognise Palestine. It’s a narrative David Seymour has leaned into.\nBut it’s not just Seymour. There are a range of strongly held views both between the coalition parties and within each of the parties themselves. The strength of emotion on the issue has been on display in the House and revealed in private meeting rooms in the Beehive.\nPeters himself has long said that he supports a two-state solution, but has been a skeptic on Palestinian recognition – questioning what it will achieve at this point in time.\nIndeed, he was particularly affronted by former foreign minister Murray McCully’s decision to co-sponsor UN Resolution 2334 in 2016 without taking it to Cabinet for approval first.\nThe resolution, which was passed while New Zealand had a seat on the Security Council, reiterated the vision for a two-state solution and expressed grave concern over actions from Israel which could further undermine that prospect.\nWhen Peters again became foreign minister (and deputy prime minister) in 2017, the Labour-NZ First coalition agreement included a commitment to record a Cabinet minute regarding the lack of process followed prior to the National-led government’s sponsorship of UNSC2334.\n“This is not a straightforward, clear-cut issue,” Peters said this month.\nRecognising statehood is never straightforward, and in the case of Gaza it’s particularly complex given the history, the current conflict, and the extreme positions of parties on both sides of the deadlock.\nNewsroom asks how has New Zealand gone about recognising new states in the past, how could the Government do it in the case of Palestine, what factors are they weighing up, and what’s the hold-up?\nGiven these challenges, New Zealanders should expect the coalition to take all the time they have between now and UN General Assembly leaders’ week – starting September 22 – to make a call.\nHow has NZ recognised states in the past?\nNew Zealand doesn’t have a specific formula or process that kicks in each time it wants to formally recognise a new state or country, and governments haven’t tended to make formal or explicit statements of recognition.\nInstead, New Zealand’s position can be inferred through its actions.\nFor example, when a country is admitted as a new member of the UN, and recognised by the international community, New Zealand follows that international agreement. Usually, what comes alongside that is establishing formal diplomatic ties and exchanging ambassadors.\nThere are other actions that can flow from recognising a new state or country.\nIn 2011, when South Sudan officially gained independence, then-foreign minister Murray McCully wrote to the country’s new foreign minister Deng Alor congratulating him on his country’s declaration of independence.\n“The birth of a new nation is always a significant event for the international community,” he wrote.\nThe New Zealand government at the time also said it was considering rolling over its contribution to the UN Sudan peacekeeping deployment to South Sudan, and offered $1 million in assistance towards the repatriation of South Sudanese refugees.\nThe minister would have taken protocol advice from his ministry at the time, and the UN had gone through the regular process to grant South Sudan recognition and membership.\nThe international community was onboard with the process and the outcome was straightforward.\nHowever, the context this time is different.\nFirst, the usual unanimity among the international community doesn’t exist.\nBeyond that, there are stipulations that a state needs to meet in order to be considered official. These are laid out by the 1933 Montevideo Convention and have been adopted as customary international law.\nLoosely, they are that the country has a defined territory, an effective government that has control over all of that territory, a clear population and an ability to interact with other states.\nThere have been cases when statehood has been recognised where there were ongoing boundary disputes or even civil wars. But in Palestine’s case, it’s clear the would-be state does not meet this orthodox criteria.\nIt’s not clear what the borders of the state would be, and there’s no governing entity which has effective control over the territory.\nAnd while there has been agreement from the international community for about 80 years that the conflict should be resolved through a two-state solution, the conventional view has always been that this would happen through negotiations between Israel and Palestine themselves.\nDone this way, there is a higher chance the two sides would achieve a comprehensive and lasting political settlement, and – as a result – the creation of the Palestinian state.\nThis obviously hasn’t happened. If anything, the vision of a two-state solution is further from being achieved than it ever has been.\nThat leaves countries, including New Zealand, asking whether they should recognise Palestine anyway – even though it doesn’t meet the conventional criteria and there’s no comprehensive political settlement.\nBut if there’s a conflict raging, if Israel doesn’t agree to a Palestinian state, if there’s no clear agreement on borders or on security, then what are countries recognising? What does recognising an abstraction actually mean? And will official recognition of Palestine will help preserve the possibility of a future two-state solution?\nWhat is the Government weighing up?\nIt’s these complications the New Zealand Government will be considering when making its decision on whether it makes a formal declaration in recognition of a Palestinian state when Peters heads to New York for the UN General Assembly next month.\nThe Government will also be asking whether recognising Palestine will actually make things better on the ground. Or, could it possibly have the opposite effect?\nThere are a range of mechanisms New Zealand and other countries have already used, or considered, since Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Regardless, the situation has continued to deteriorate.\nMinisterial statements in the House and written statements New Zealand has signed onto with global partners have repeatedly voiced concerns at the humanitarian situation in Gaza, as well as Hamas’ actions.\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon has described scenes on the ground as “incredibly heartbreaking”, and Peters’ latest ministerial statement condemned actions from both sides. But the Government has repeatedly stressed that New Zealand has limited influence.\nSome view these comments as a cop-out, saying there is more the coalition could do, from recognising statehood and using New Zealand troops to drop aid in Gaza (something the Government briefly looked at but hasn’t considered a viable option), to autonomous sanctions.\nGreen Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick has put forward a member’s bill which would allow the imposition of sanctions against individuals and entities associated with Israel’s unlawful presence in Gaza and the West Bank. And a survey from John Minto’s Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa found 60 percent of people support sanctions. But the coalition parties don’t support this bill.\nPeters also received criticism on Friday for not joining withy 22 countries, including the UK, Australia and Canada, to make a joint statement condemning illegal Israeli settlements. About the same time the statement was released, the foreign minister was on a call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in which they discussed Gaza among other global issues.\nBut a spokesperson for Peters says the minister holds the view that “providing a running commentary on the situation on the ground in the Middle East while the Government is considering this matter is unhelpful and counterproductive”. As for joint statements more generally, some New Zealand signs, and some it does not.\nBeyond statements of concern and condemnation, the Government has designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation, and has taken the unusual step of sanctioning certain Israeli ministers with particularly extreme views. The coalition also quietly provided a further $8m in aid funding at the end of June, following a six-month gap in contributions.\nThe majority of Israeli people don’t support a two-state solution, or are skeptical Israel and Palestine can co-exist peacefully, according to a Pew Research survey conducted during February and March. The 21 percent of Israeli adults who think they can coexist peacefully is the lowest since the research centre began asking the question in 2013.\nWhile Israelis want the conflict to end, the majority see recognition of Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas.\nHamas doesn’t believe in a two-state solution either, and while the group has experienced a steep decline in popularity since the latest conflict began, polling from May shows Hamas retains more support among Palestinians than any other political party or faction.\nThe same poll from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research shows 4 in 10 Palestinians support the two-state solution, but when asked in a different context 60 percent support a Palestinian state.\nWhile the Palestinian Authority does believe in the two-state vision, it doesn’t have the popular backing of the people.\nWhere do other countries stand?\nA growing number of countries have – or plan to – officially recognise a Palestinian state.\nThere are 147 out of 193 United Nations countries that now recognise Palestine, with a group of New Zealand’s partners saying they plan to formally recognise the state at the UN next month.\nMost of the nations that recognise a state of Palestine did so in 1988 following the Palestine National Council’s declaration of the state. Other non-Western states followed suit in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.\nIn the spring of 2024, more European and Caribbean nations recognised a Palestinian state, including Barbados, Ireland, Jamaica, Norway and Spain.\nAnd in recent weeks, France, Canada and Australia have said they plan to recognise Palestine next month. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom has conditionally said it will recognise a Palestinian state if Israel does not meet criteria that include agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded by accusing these nation’s leaders as siding with “mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers”.\nIn announcing their September plans, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong said: “The Netanyahu government is extinguishing the prospect of a two-state solution by rapidly expanding illegal settlements, threatening annexation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and explicitly opposing any Palestinian state.\n“The international community is moving to establish a Palestinian state consistent with a two-state solution.”\nIn response, Netanyahu said Albanese would be remembered as a “weak politician who betrayed Israel and abandoned Australia’s Jews”.\nWhile the majority of UN member countries now recognise Palestine as its own state, there are some who haven’t, including the US, Germany and Italy. Those still weighing up its options include some of New Zealand’s close security partners: Singapore, Japan and South Korea.\nWhat are NZ’s options?\nThe Government has three options: the status quo, full recognition, or something more conditional.\nOther like-minded countries moving towards recognition have put a variety of conditions on recognition, but there is no suggestion that they won’t follow through with their pledges when their leaders arrive in New York.\nFor instance, Australia’s recognition is predicated on the Palestinian Authority undergoing major reform in areas of governance, schooling, demilitarisation and holding general elections.\nThe UK says it will recognise Palestine unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza and revives the prospect of a two-state solution ahead of the UN General Assembly.\nMeanwhile, New Zealand leaders have already named a couple of their own key conditions.\nAll three coalition parties agree that Hamas must be excluded from any future Palestinian government – a condition that may not be easily met given the group’s leadership role in Gaza, with the BBC reporting this month on its ongoing payments to civil servants even as the bloodshed continues.\nMeanwhile, Seymour says the release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas should be an “obvious precondition” to any diplomatic recognition – a firmer stance than the Prime Minister, who has shied away from staking out a position before further Cabinet talks.\nGovernance of a Palestinian state is also a problem.\nThe Palestinian Authority is viewed internationally as the representative of the Palestinian people and has representation as an observer at the UN, and Peters has met with both the prime minister and the foreign minister of the Palestinian Authority during this parliamentary term. But the authority doesn’t hold a mandate from the Palestinian people.\nThe last time there was an election, Palestinians rejected Fatah (the controlling faction of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation). Meanwhile, polling data out of Gaza and the West Bank shows greater support for Hamas.\nHowever, the Government has the option of recognising Palestine without formally recognising the authority. This means there wouldn’t be formal diplomatic relations, exchanging ambassadors, or entering into government-to-government agreements.\nThere are examples where New Zealand recognises a country or state, but not the ruling party or power, such as the military junta in Myanmar and the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nWhat’s the hold-up?\nThe prevailing narrative is that the Act Party has created a roadblock. But while Seymour and his party clearly have strong views on the topic, it’s not the Government’s only reason for waiting.\nOn one side, there are those who see recognition as rewarding Hamas, and for many this move would go against their conservative religious beliefs, or those of their constituents.\nOn the other, the Government has faced increased protest activity and calls from the Green Party, Te Pāti Māori and parts of Labour to recognise statehood as an obvious first step.\nAfter being kicked out of the House for calling Government MPs spineless for not lending their support to her Israeli sanctions bill, Green co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick told reporters that after almost two years into the Gaza conflict “this Government continues to pour shame on our legacy of standing for human rights and justice”.\n“New Zealanders, and the world, are sick of the blame game. They expect their so-called leaders to just do something and to do the right thing, and it’s pretty bloody clear what the right thing is here.”\nPublic awareness about Palestine is mounting as more people are bombarded with a stream of horrific images of bloodshed and starvation in Gaza. There is no doubt that Kiwis have formed stronger views on the topic during the past 22 months. Even so, it seems clear the Government won’t be rushed on its decision.\nThen there is the context on the ground. The situation in Gaza is constantly evolving, and the context in early August could be very different to the one in late September; the Government will be watching the reaction to other countries’ declarations\nIn light of heavy international pressure in July following news of the Israeli Defence Force targeting civilians lining up for food aid and increasing starvation, Israel brought in a daily pause in fighting in parts of Gaza.\nBut this reprieve was short-lived and only limited aid made it through.\nSince then, it seems statements of strength from the international community against Israel’s campaign have been met with increasing stubbornness by Netanyahu.\nThere could be a tipping point for the prime minister – a point where the pushback from the international community is too great, but it’s hard to know where that line is, or what testing this theory could mean for Palestinian civilians.\nEven the US, which has more leverage than most other countries, has struggled to wield it to any effect.\nIf somehow a ceasefire deal is reached before next month’s leaders’ week at the UN, it would dramatically impact the Government’s calculations, with the prospect of a two-state solution looking more likely.\nWhile anything could change, and both the Prime Minister and foreign minister say there is no exact date for an announcement planned yet, it’s likely Cabinet will make a final call on recognising Palestine just ahead of Peters’ trip.\nCabinet is expected to meet on September 15 ahead of the UN General Assembly the following week.\nAnd the Palestinian Authority is expected to host a conference call on Monday, September 22, at the start of leaders’ week. The call will be used to discuss the two-state solution, and Palestinian statehood is likely to be the primary theme of the week.\nIt seems the Government will use every second it can to talk it out, and to monitor what happens on the other side of the world. And the central question they will be asking is: will it make a difference in the quest for peace in the Middle East?\nWithout wishing to be totally cynical, Luxon just confirmed his fear of upsetting his junior (senior?) coalition parties on RNZ when questioned about why NZ is not included on the latest global collective response regarding Israel’s attack on Gaza. He twice said that this question should be referred to the Foreign Minister, Winston Peters.\nOn August 13th, Luxon said Netanyahu had “gone too far” and “lost the plot”. An hour after these statements he clarified these were his personal opinions. Just enough time for Peters to tell Luxon, again, to stay out of Foreign Affairs and, no doubt, for Seymour to remind him that ACT supports Israel.\nThe reason for the delay in NZ making a declaration on Palestine is no more complex than a combination of Luxon’s weakness as a leader and the competing egos of this coalition of chaos.\nRe “Hamas doesn’t believe in a two-state solution either” – however this changed in 2017 – https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/5/2/hamas-accepts-palestinian-state-with-1967-borders\n“Principles, values and interests” all suggest we should move to recognise Palestine as governed by the Palestinian Authority. Principles because we have always stood for a two state solution and for (eventual) self-determination of the Palestinian people; Values because we abhor the violence on the ground and stand for human rights as well as an international system which provides a framework for interaction between states; Interests because our like-minded partners are already moving in this direction and we risk being “last cab off the rank”. But will this change things in Gaza and the West Bank? Simply put not unless we along with those same like-minded partners resolve to bring pressure probably through sanctions on the State of Israel and commit to practical assistance for the newly recognised state of Palestine. If not the latter then the former could be seen as an empty gesture but nonetheless one which would signal to the world where we stand: and since the State of Israel seems most concerned by it this suggests it is probably the right thing to do.\nAs abhorrent as the Israeli genocide is, a Palestinian state that is not allowed to arm itself for defence – as is regularly suggested as a solution – is in effect cow-towing down to Israeli propaganda and continued apartheid. It is simply exasperating an already exasperated situation. Israel has shown itself to be untrustworthy in its colonisation of firstly Palestine and now its obvious intents regarding Gaza and The West Bank. Full statehood and ability to defend itself is the only solution and needs to be backed up by all of those professing abhorrence but proposing a wet blanket solution. Israel was once called Palestine for a reason – it was full of Palestinians."

      "text": "The United Nations has declared famine in Gaza, warning of mass starvation and death as the ongoing genocide pushes millions into further catastrophe.\nThe UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said: “As of 15 August 2025, Famine (IPC Phase 5)—with reasonable evidence—is confirmed in Gaza Governorate.” It added: “After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterized by starvation, destitution and death.”\nThe analysis projected that famine will spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of September. It warned that nearly a third of the population, 641,000 people will face famine, while 1.14 million others will be in “Emergency” conditions. It noted that North Gaza may be “as severe—or worse—than in Gaza Governorate,” but the absence of data prevented formal classification.\nThe IPC report described conditions as worsening rapidly. It said: “Through June 2026, at least 132,000 children under five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition—double the IPC estimates from May 2025. This includes over 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death.” It cited 25,000 infants in urgent need of nutrition support, along with 55,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women.\nThe report attributed the crisis to collapsed food systems, soaring prices and blocked aid. “Immediate, large-scale, unobstructed multi-sector humanitarian assistance is critical to avert further destitution, starvation and death,” it warned. “This is not possible without an immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict.”\nThe Famine Review Committee said the disaster was “entirely man-made” and cautioned: “Any further delay—even by days—will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality.”\nJean-Marten Bauer of the World Food Program (WFP) and Richard Peeperkorn of the WHO said at a Geneva briefing: “For the first time, we have a famine in the Middle East.”\nSubscribe to our newsletter and stay updated on the latest news and updates from around the Muslim world!\nInternational condemnation\nSince 7 October 2023, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 62,600 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry. At least 289 people, including 115 children, have died of malnutrition and starvation, while more than 2,000 have been killed while trying to access food aid.\nInternational leaders and agencies issued strong rebukes. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “This man-made, widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases like diarrhoea are becoming fatal, especially for children.” He added: “A ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative,” warning that Gaza’s health system, run by “hungry and exhausted health workers,” cannot cope.\nFood and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) chief Qu Dongyu said: “Access to food is not a privilege – it is a basic human right.” WFP’s Cindy McCain warned: “Full humanitarian access and a ceasefire now are critical to save lives.”\nUNICEF’s Catherine Russell described “children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat; babies dying from hunger and preventable disease.” UNICEF stressed: “There is no time to lose.” Russell added that children on the brink of death need therapeutic feeding. Tedros said: “Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines to save lives and begin the process of reversing malnutrition. Hospitals must be protected, aid blockages must end, and peace must be restored, so that healing can begin.”\nEuropean officials condemned Israel’s conduct. EU commissioner Hadja Lahbib wrote: “Famine is a reality in Gaza, now confirmed by @theIPCinfo report. People are dying from starvation.”\nIrish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said Israel had an “absolute obligation to allow the people there unfettered and urgent access to humanitarian aid, medical and food supplies.”\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the famine “utterly horrifying and … wholly preventable,” adding: “The Government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further.” Slovenia’s deputy prime minister Tanja Fajon said: “Famine is the new phase of hell Gaza faces in this man-made catastrophe. This has to stop.”\nScotland’s First Minister John Swinney said starvation represented “genocide in plain sight.” German Foreign Ministry spokesman Josef Hinterseher told reporters: “I think there is no doubt that there is hunger in Gaza.”\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini declared: “It’s time for the Government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza.” He added: “All of those who have influence must use it with determination and a sense of moral duty. Every hour counts.”\nIsraeli response\nMeanwhile, Israeli politics revealed stark divisions. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told the military: “No water, no electricity – let them die of hunger or surrender. This is what we want, and you’re capable of doing it.”\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir asked the army chief: “Are you scared of the military advocate general?”\nMilitary chief Eyal Zamir fired back at ministers: “You don’t understand anything. You don’t know what a brigade or battalion is. This takes time.” His remark was aimed at undermining the two ministers’ experience and dismissing their view on military operations.\nIsrael insists it is fighting Hamas and denies responsibility for the famine and shortage of aid. However, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ex-Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes, while Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ)."

      "text": "As the situation continues to deteriorate, the United Nations has officially declared a famine in the Gaza Strip, with UN Secretary-General António Guterres calling it a 'failure of humanity'. Guterres has described the famine as a 'man-made disaster' and a 'moral indictment'.\n\"Famine is not about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,\" he said in a statement.\n5 lakh people facing 'catastrophic hunger'\nIn its report, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a multi-stakeholder initiative that analyses the severity of a food crisis - said that half a million people in Gaza are \"facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death\".\nIt further claimed that the famine will worsen by the end of September and may even expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. It noted that acute malnutrition will continue to worsen 'rapidly'.\n\"Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while those in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely rise to 1.14 million (58 per cent),\" the report said.\nBy June next year, 1.32 lakh children under the age of five will suffer from acute malnutrition, which is double the estimates of the IPC from May this year. This includes more than 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death, the report stated.\nWhat is the criteria for declaring a famine by the UN?\nThere are three criteria for the UN to declare a famine. First, if at least 20 per cent of the population in a particular area is facing 'extreme levels of hunger'. Second, if 30 per cent of the children in the same area \"are wasted, or too thin for their height\". Third, if the mortality rate has doubled, and two people out of every 10,000 or four children out of every 10,000 are dying of hunger every day.\nWhat happens when the UN declares a famine?\nThe UN declares a famine in a particular area, suggesting that the affected place is not able to manage the crisis on its own. Once a famine is declared, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) start sending food supplies and medicines for the affected population, while the World Health Organization (WHO) starts monitoring the spread of any disease in the affected area.\nA declaration of a famine also means that a government cannot obstruct relief efforts. In this case, Israel has been blamed for obstructing relief efforts. Even the UN has said that Israel has restricted the amount of aid entering Gaza.\nEarlier this year, Israel imposed a two-and-a-half-month blockade on Gaza, but later resumed some access.\nWhat did Israel say on UN's declaration of famine in Gaza?\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has rejected the famine declared by the UN in Gaza. In a post on 'X' (formerly Twitter) on August 22, it said Israel does not have a policy of starvation, but prevents it either.\n\"The IPC report is an outright lie,\" Netanyahu's office said. \"Since the beginning of the war Israel has enabled 2 million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip, over one ton of aid per person.\"\n'Israel cannot deny its duties'\nThe UN, however, has clearly said that Israel cannot deny its duties and give any excuses. \"As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population,\" said Guterres.\nWhat is the situation in Gaza?\nAccording to the Gaza Health Ministry, 62,622 Palestinians have lost their lives since the beginning of the war that was launched by Israel in response to the October 7 attacks. Malnutrition-related deaths also stand at 281."

      "text": "History shows that famines are, for the most part, engineered. Be it through carelessness, selfishness or plain malice on the part of officialdom, creating the circumstances under which a population expires to hunger is a matter of construction. As the economist and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen so powerfully showed in Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation (1981), the focus on the cause of famines should be less on the food supply and more on the economic, social and political factors surrounding them. Food prices might severely spike. Food distribution systems can fail. Certain groups in society may lose their means of employment, thereby preventing them from purchasing essential foodstuffs.\nIn Gaza, the conditions of famine have been in the making for months. From March, when the Netanyahu government purposely halted all food from entering Gaza, only to ease the blockade in May through a handful of food distribution points murderously overseen by the Israeli Defense Forces and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the only question was when that ghastly outcome would be realised. “As was the case for the UK government in Ireland in the 1840s and Bengal in the 1940s, Israel is responsible for this famine because it controls almost all the Gaza strip and its borders,” writes Ilan Noy, an expert on the economics of disasters and climate change. “But Israel has also created the conditions for the famine.”\nBy the end of July, the New York Times, citing data from the Gaza Governorate Chamber of Commerce and Industry, listed a number of basic food items that had become obscenely priced: sugar, costing $106 per kilogram, as opposed to 89 cents prior to the war; flour, costing $12 per kilogram compared with the pre-war price of 42 cents; and tomatoes: $30 per kilogram, a shocking increase from the pre-war level of 59 cents. Hebrew University academic and economic historian Yanni Spitzer, casting his eye over the soaring food prices, observed that the situation had shifted from the start of the war, given the testimonies coming from the Strip.\nOn August 22, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee (FRC) published a report claiming that 514,000 people – a roughly a quarter of Gaza’s population – faced famine conditions for the period July 1 to August 15, described in technical terms as IPC Phase 5. The body defines IPC 5 as “the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity Scale, and is attributed when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 dying each day due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease.” The Committee was satisfied that reasonable evidence was available showing that the IPC Phase 5 conditions were affecting the Gaza Governorate. It also concluded that “the severity of conditions in North Gaza similar or worse than in Gaza Governorate”, though refrained from an official classification given “limited evidence on the population in this area”.\nThe IPC report is also adamant that the central and southern regions, comprising the governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, will face the same level of catastrophic food insecurity next month, taking the number to over 640,000. A further 1.14 million in the territory will be in an Emergency (IPC Phase 4) state, with a further 396,000 people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions. “The time for debate and hesitation,” urge the authors, “has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading.” Any further delays to reverse this “entirely made-made” famine “will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality.”\nIn keeping with other famine-inducing authorities in the past, COGAT, Israel’s military arm responsible for overseeing the distribution of aid, offers a thin gruel of denial. The report was, COGAT thundered in its published response, “false and relies on partial, biased data and superficial information originating from Hamas, a terrorist organization, often laundered through organizations with vested interests.” The IPC, in any case, could not be trusted, ignoring Israel’s own information and repeatedly providing “inaccurate” assessments that failed to “reflect the reality on the ground.”\nOne could only express awe at the unflinching mendacity of the following statements: “The report disregards the fact that in recent weeks we have advanced significant efforts and that the overall trend has shifted”; “Since the start of the war, and specifically over the past several months, COGAT, in cooperation with other Israeli authorities and international partners, has implemented an extensive humanitarian operation in the Gaza Strip.” There had also been “a sharp decline in the prices of food, which plummeted in the markets.” Even as this is happening, however, a convenient culprit always looms large: “Hamas has not ceased its attempts to exploit humanitarian aid for its own military buildup.”\nBe it willed ignorance or sinister motivation, Israel’s official response sidesteps the fundamental problem: the issue was always whether food would be allowed to reach a hungry Palestinian civilian population through unabridged humanitarian channels. Given the complete blockade of March and the choking, murderous points of food distribution set up in Gaza after May, the answer is all too clear in its grimness. As Forensic Architecture and the World Peace Foundation (WPF) plausibly contend, “Israel has effectively dismantled the existing ‘civilian model’ of aid distribution” long used and accepted in favour of a “military model”. This suggested a pattern, one positively crying out for judicial scrutiny and international sanctions."

That must shame the world to do better.\"\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) committee, responsible for determining the presence of famine, confirmed on Friday that famine is currently occurring in Gaza and is projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis cities in the coming weeks. IPC warned that by the end of September, nearly a third of Gaza's population – more than 640,000 people – could face catastrophic hunger, with another 1.14 million at emergency levels.\nAt the press briefing in Geneva, Fletcher said: \"Please read the IPC report, cover to cover. Read it in sorrow and in anger. Not as words and numbers but as names and lives. Be in no doubt that this is irrefutable testimony.\"\n\"My ask, my plea, my demand to (Israeli) Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu and anyone who can reach him: Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south, all of them. Let us get food and other supplies in, unimpeded and at the massive scale required,\" said the UN humanitarian chief.\n'Man-made' disaster\nThe IPC announcement triggered a UN reaction led by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\"Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: 'famine,'\" he said in a statement while visiting Expo 2025 Osaka in Japan.\n\"This is not a mystery, it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself,\" he said, noting that famine is not only about food, but also the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival.\nAs the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law, including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies for the population, said Guterres, adding that this situation could not be allowed to continue with impunity.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, Commissioner-General of UNRWA, also said the crisis was \"by design and man-made,\" blaming Israel for blocking food and other basic supplies, including UN aid, for months.\nIsrael rejected the IPC findings. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office called the report \"an outright lie,\" saying Israel \"does not have a policy of starvation\" but rather \"a policy of preventing starvation.\"\nGaza's Health Ministry said 273 people, including 112 children, have died from starvation and malnutrition since the war began.\nIsrael tightened its blockade on Gaza after the collapse of a ceasefire with Hamas on March 2, sharply curbing food, fuel and humanitarian aid deliveries.\nDutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp, who had faced criticism after proposing a possible trade ban on products from Israeli settlements in a letter to parliament, resigned on Friday. He announced his decision in The Hague following a meeting of the Council of Ministers.\n\"I see that I cannot take sufficiently meaningful additional measures to increase pressure on Israel,\" Veldkamp told reporters. He added that while the Netherlands had \"nothing to be ashamed of,\" he had encountered persistent opposition within the cabinet to his push for tougher policies regarding Gaza City and the West Bank.\nDisplaced Palestinians travel on a vehicle loaded with belongings as they flee amid an Israeli military operation, in Gaza, August 22, 2025. /VCG\nOngoing offensive\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that multiple strikes were reported overnight in the Jabalya al-Balad and An Nazla neighborhoods, adding that as strikes continue to intensify across the strip, casualties are flooding hospital emergency departments.\nHumanitarian partners monitoring population movements in Gaza reported around 900 people had fled, heading toward the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood and western Gaza City, said the office.\nOCHA said the United Nations and its partners warned of the catastrophic consequences that the intensification of the ongoing offensive in Gaza City would have for civilians, reminding relevant parties to the conflict of their obligations under international law to protect civilians, including humanitarian workers and those who cannot or choose not to move.\nThe office said that those fleeing must be allowed to do so safely, to return if they wish and as the situation allows. It reiterated the urgency of ensuring people's access to aid and basic services, whether they leave or stay.\nHumanitarian partners working in health care said that nearly half of all hospitals and field hospitals in Gaza City account for 40 percent of the total inpatient bed capacity in Gaza. Expansion of military operations would further cripple the collapsing health care system.\n(With input from Xinhua)"

      "text": "What Happens If The UN Declares Famine In Gaza And Why It Matters | Explained\nThe United Nations declares a famine when 20% of the population lacks sufficient food, hunger causes 2+ deaths per 10,000 daily, and over 30% of children are malnourished\nThe United Nations officially declared a famine in Gaza on August 22, stating that 500,000 people are facing “catastrophic\" hunger. This announcement raises questions about whether aid will now reach the region, especially given the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s immediate response that “there is no famine in Gaza\".\nThe United Nations officially declares famine in a region when the situation reaches a severe humanitarian crisis, indicating not just a shortage of food but widespread distress. The term “famine\" is applied cautiously under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) scale.\nRecommended Stories\nCriteria For Declaring A Famine\nThe United Nations declares a famine when three critical conditions are met:\n- 20% of the population does not have enough food.\n- At least 2 out of every 10,000 people are dying of hunger daily.\n- Over 30% of children are malnourished.\nA famine declaration signifies a severe humanitarian crisis beyond mere food shortage, indicating mass deaths due to hunger.\nWhat Happens When A Famine Is Declared\n- When a famine is declared, a global alarm is sounded, suggesting that the affected area cannot manage the crisis alone.\n- The World Food Programme (WFP) promptly sends large quantities of food grains.\n- UNICEF provides high-energy food supplements and medicines for children and mothers.\n- The World Health Organization monitors disease spread, which often accompanies famine.\n- The UN appeals for funds from member countries, donor agencies, and NGOs worldwide.\n- It pressures local governments not to obstruct relief efforts. (For example, in Somalia or Sudan, the government or militias often blocked relief supplies)\n- Violence, looting, and migration often occur in famine-affected areas. United Nations peacekeeping or international security forces can protect relief distribution, which also brings the area under UN peacekeeping.\nImpact On People’s Lives\n- Special camps are established in affected areas to provide food and water.\n- Priority is given to children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.\n- Daily airlifts and relief trucks are dispatched to deliver aid.\n- In prolonged crises, millions of people may be displaced, seeking refuge in neighboring countries.\nAssessment Process Before Famine Declaration\n- Data is collected from various sources.\n- Information is obtained from the local health ministry, hospitals, and clinics, documenting child malnutrition and hunger-related deaths.\n- Market surveys are conducted to assess food availability and prices.\n- The status of water, electricity, and fuel is evaluated.\n- The frequency of daily meals among the population is recorded.\n- Child malnutrition is measured through weight and height assessments.\n- Data on deaths, particularly among children under five, is compiled and analysed.\nDecision-Making Committee\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is composed of experts from UN agencies, NGOs and local authorities. This team compiles data to assess the condition of different areas. Before declaring a famine, the Famine Review Committee conducts an independent evaluation, including international specialists in food security, nutrition, and epidemiology, to verify the reliability of the data and ensure the assessment is free from political influence.\nInvolvement Of Various Organisations\n- The report is submitted to the office of the United Nations Secretary-General.\n- The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs issues an official press statement.\n- The World Food Programme, UNICEF, Food and Agriculture Organization, and World Health Organization jointly present the report.\n- The Global Committee of the IPC then provides technical approval.\n- This process does not require the consent of any specific country or countries.\nDeployment Of Peace Force\nThe UN peace force is deployed only in cases of violence, armed conflict, or political instability, following a resolution by the United Nations Security Council. If routes are unsafe, the UN Security Force or local army provides protection. Peacekeepers may guard food convoys, camps, and prevent looting.\nComplexities In Gaza\nThe situation in Gaza is complicated as the UN Peace Force has never been deployed there due to opposition from Israel and the United States, with the latter often exercising its veto power. The delivery of relief materials requires an agreement between Israel, Egypt, and Hamas, with some borders opened under UN supervision.\n- Location :\n- First Published:"

      "text": "The UN-affiliated body that monitors mass hunger has for the first time officially declared a famine in Gaza City and warned that other areas of Gaza will soon face famine.\nThe announcement by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is the first time that the organization has declared a famine outside of Africa.\nThe declaration of a famine in Gaza stands as yet another piece of evidence that Israel, with the support of the imperialist powers, is deliberately seeking to exterminate the Palestinian people through mass starvation.\nThe IPC noted that recent months have seen the “most severe deterioration” since the Israeli onslaught on Gaza began in October 2023.\nThe report warned that “this famine is entirely man-made.” It added that “after 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterized by starvation, destitution, and death.”\nIt warned that “through June 2026, at least 132,000 children under five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition—double the IPC estimates from May 2025.”\nThe IPC blamed the famine on the complete cutoff of humanitarian aid deliveries by Israel earlier this year. It noted that “the complete halt of humanitarian and commercial food deliveries in March and April, followed by critically low volumes through July, coupled with the collapse of local food production, has led to extreme food shortages.”\nAfter Israel halted food deliveries into the country, it largely forced the shutdown of the operation of legitimate humanitarian organizations within the country and replaced them with a US-Israeli outfit known as the “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation” (GHF).\nThe GHF turned the distribution of meager food rations in southern Gaza into the occasion for massacring desperate and hungry civilians, opening fire on dozens of occasions and killing hundreds of people. The food distributed at these death trap facilities are mere starvation rations, aimed at luring the population to the south in order to trap them in concentration camps.\nResponding to the report, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said that “it is a famine that we could have prevented had we been allowed. … Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.”\nThe IPC has only declared famines four times in the past: in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The organization defines famine as two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition, and one in three children actively malnourished.\nResponding to the report, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the famine in Gaza as a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\nHe added, “As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law—including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies for the population. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nUN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher added, “It is a famine that we repeatedly warned of. But that the international media has not been allowed in to cover. … A 21st-century famine watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history. It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war. It is a famine on all of our watch. Everyone owns this. The Gaza Famine is the world’s famine. It is a famine that asks ‘but what did you do?’”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the report in Hitlerian fashion, not only denying the famine but claiming that the occupying force imposing it on the Palestinian population is seeking to save them from hunger. “Israel does not have a policy of starvation. Israel has a policy of preventing starvation,” he said. “Israel will continue to act responsibly, ensuring aid reaches Gaza’s civilians while destroying Hamas’s terror machine.”\nSeveral imperialist backers of the Gaza genocide responded to the findings of the IPC with hypocritical criticism of Israel. In a statement, UK Foreign Secretary David Lamy said that “the confirmation of famine in Gaza City is utterly horrifying and wholly preventable. The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.”\nBut the UK, along with the other imperialist powers, has repeatedly stated that Israel has the “right to defend itself” against the people it illegally occupies and whose land it is attempting to annex. The British government has repeatedly prosecuted and jailed critics of the Gaza genocide.\nAccording to figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry, 89 people in Gaza were killed by malnutrition or starvation in the first seven months of the year. But this month so far 138 people have died from starvation.\n“We are seeing the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe that we can even measure,” said Jeanette Bailey, a spokesperson for the International Rescue Committee, in a statement.\n“Without consistent entry and distribution of items like specialized supplementary feeding items—high-energy biscuits and fortified foods—we are watching a preventable crisis turn into a widespread nutrition emergency,” Antoine Renard, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, told Reuters. “At first, it affects the most vulnerable groups, but of course, that will broaden,” he added.\nFrom June to August, the number of children suffering wasting from food shortages nearly doubled, hitting more than 12,000, the World Health Organization said.\nThe declaration of famine came just days after the Israeli military announced the launch of its long-planned attack on Gaza City, which is aimed at the total military conquest of Gaza in preparation for the roundup of its population to concentration camps and their forcible displacement from their ancestral land.\nLast week, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the attack on Gaza City “risks triggering an unprecedented, life-threatening humanitarian crisis.”\nThe proclamation of famine by the IPC comes just one day after a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call revealed that, according to Israel’s own figures, civilians accounted for about 83 percent of the total death toll in Gaza.\nThe publications obtained military intelligence estimates that listed 8,900 fighters from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as “probably” or confirmed dead. Over the same period, a total of 53,000 people in Gaza were reported killed, meaning that alleged fighters amounted to just 17 percent of the death toll. This massive level of civilian death is almost totally unprecedented in modern warfare.\nErika Guevara Rosas, a spokesperson for Amnesty International, said “this famine is the direct consequence of Israel’s deliberate campaign of starvation in Gaza. … The deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid, the destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure, and the direct killings of civilians are a clear manifestation of how Israel is inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as part of its ongoing genocide.”"

      "text": "A young man walks with a sack on his shoulder with other people carrying bags of humanitarian aid they received at a distribution centre run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), as they cross the so-called \"Netzarim Corridor\" in the central Gaza Strip, Friday. AFP-Yonhap GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — The world's leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine , and that it's likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month. The determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel's restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children. Israel rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.” The grim milestone — the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East — is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been fighting Hamas since the militant group's Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to seize Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, an escalation experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis. The IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war. More than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the findings show a “human-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself,” and appealed for an “immediate ceasefire.” Netanyahu denies there's hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas. “The IPC report is an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” his office posted on X. The U.S. State Department also sought to cast doubt on the report. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “is a serious concern,” but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid. After the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths in recent weeks, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the United Nations says what's entering is far below what's needed. The Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, known as COGAT, called the report “false and biased.” It said significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks. Israel's Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. But experts say Gaza is still reeling from the tightening of the blockade from early March until mid-May, when Israel barred the import of all food, medicine and other goods. “A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group. Netanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel’s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether. Formal famine determinations are rare. The IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed: At least 20 percent of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30 percent of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15 percent of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease. Palestinians struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Gaza City, northern Gaza Strip, Aug. 16. AP-Yonhap The data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached. The IPC warned that a third of Gaza’s population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount. Alex de Waal, author of “Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine” and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner. “It seems that it’s necessary for experts to shout ‘famine!’ before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,” he said. Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there’s currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys. Witnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated. On the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington. Throughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighborhoods have been almost completely destroyed . Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year . Doctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients. Kirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving. She said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Thousands will be too weak to evacuate the city ahead of the planned offensive, said Blacka. Families in Gaza City say they're watching their loved ones waste away. Yousef Sbeteh's two teenage children were wounded by an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they've both lost weight because there hasn't been enough food, he said, adding that he can't afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions. His 15-year-old daughter, Aya, lost nearly 20 kilograms (44 pounds), or about 30 percent of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say. “Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,” Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. “But I can't provide that now.”"

Just in August, there have been at least 138 deaths, including 25 minors, the ministry said on Friday.\nThe IPC said the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made”, driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should “haunt us all”.\n“It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” he said.\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said “it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare”.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access to Gaza, adding: “We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nThe International Red Cross described the declaration of famine as “devastating and entirely foreseeable”.\n“Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met,” it said in a statement.\nOutrage\nHamas called on Friday for an immediate end to the war in Gaza and the lifting of the Israeli siege on the territory.\nIn a statement published online, the group called for “immediate action by the UN and the security council to stop the war and lift the siege” and demanded that crossings be opened “without restrictions to allow the urgent and continuous entry of food, medicine, water and fuel”.\nIt said the declaration by the UN confirmed the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza — but lamented that it came far too late.\nBritain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday condemned the famine in Gaza as a “moral outrage” and a “man-made catastrophe”.\nCalling it “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable”, he called on Israel to take urgent action to remedy the situation.\n“We are seeing the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe that we can even measure,” said Jeanette Bailey, a child nutrition lead at the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based aid organisation.\n‘Too weak to cry’\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.\n“The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,” said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell.\nThe local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98pc of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said.\nMeanwhile, livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.\nThe IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025"

The agency described the famine as “entirely man-made,” adding that it could be reversed or halted.\n- Israel makes chilling threat and warns Gaza could be obliterated\n- Netanyahu says he will approve plans to take over Gaza City\n“The time for debate has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed,” the IPC said in the report.\n“Any further delay—even by days—will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality.”\nThe IPC warned that if a ceasefire is not reached between Israel and Hamas and if food supplies and other aid are not restored immediately, \"avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.\"\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, according to the report.\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said the findings show a \"a failure of humanity itself” and called for an “immediate ceasefire.”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the report, calling it \"an outright lie.\"\n\"Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” his office posted on X.\nThe report comes after Israel vowed to seize Gaza City, in a move experts say will worsen the hunger crisis.\nThere have been hundreds of people killed at new food-distribution sites run by the US-Israeli backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The aid sites were opened several weeks ago, after Israel faced international condemnation for blocking the entry of all food, water and other aid supplies to Gaza for nearly three months.\nIsrael has employed private security contractors to take control of the distribution of supplies, accusing Hamas of keeping aid for itself, without providing evidence. The UN has said the new aid distribution system violates humanitarian principles."

      "text": "Israel’s defense minister warned Friday that Gaza’s largest city could be destroyed unless Hamas yields to his country’s terms, as the world’s leading authority on food crises declared that the city is gripped by famine from fighting and an Israeli blockade.\nA day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to mount a major operation to seize Gaza City, Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that it could “turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,” areas largely reduced to rubble earlier in the war.\n“The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas’ murderers and rapists in Gaza — until they agree to Israel’s conditions for ending the war,” Katz wrote in a post on X.\nHe restated Israel’s ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas’ complete disarmament.\nHamas issued a statement that called Katz’s comments “a confession of committing a crime that amounts to ethnic cleansing.”\nThe militant group has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but it rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, expressed frustration with Hamas’ stance in long-running ceasefire talks, suggesting the militant group was less interested in making deals to release hostages with so few left alive in captivity.\n“The situation has to end. It’s extortion, and it has to end,” Trump told reporters Friday. “And we’ll see what happens. I actually think (the hostages are) safer in many ways if you went in and you really went in fast and you did it.”\nNetanyahu on Thursday said he had instructed officials “to begin immediate negotiations” to release hostages and end the war on Israel’s terms. It was not immediately clear if that meant Israel would return to long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the mediators.\nGaza City offensive could begin within days\nWith ground troops already active in strategic areas, the wide-scale operation in Gaza City could start within days.\nIsrael says Gaza City is still a Hamas stronghold, with a network of militant tunnels, after several previous large-scale raids. The city is also home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, some of whom have fled from other areas, and it contains some of the territory’s critical infrastructure and health facilities.\nGet daily National news\nIsrael could also accept the latest ceasefire proposal, which would forestall the offensive. The proposal calls for a phased deal involving hostage and prisoner exchanges and a pullback of Israeli troops, while talks continue on a longer-term cease-fire. Israeli leaders have resisted such terms since abandoning a similar agreement earlier this year under pressure from Netanyahu’s far-right coalition allies.\nMany Israelis fear an assault could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack.\nAid groups and international leaders warn that renewed fighting would worsen Gaza’s humanitarian crisis.\nThe logistics of evacuating civilians are expected to be daunting. Many residents say repeated displacement is pointless since nowhere in Gaza is safe, while medical groups warn that Israel’s call to move patients south is unworkable, with no facilities to receive them.\nNetanyahu has argued that the offensive is the surest way to free captives and crush Hamas.\n“These two things — defeating Hamas and releasing all our hostages — go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said Thursday while touring a command center in southern Israel.\nSince 251 people were taken hostage more than 22 months ago, ceasefire agreements and other deals have accounted for the vast majority of the 148 who were released, including the bodies of eight dead hostages.\nIsrael has managed to rescue only eight hostages alive and to retrieve the bodies of 49 others. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive.\nReport declares famine in Gaza City\nThe world’s leading authority on food crises declared Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue.\nA report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. It’s the first famine confirmed by the IPC in the Middle East.\nNetanyahu’s office denounced the IPC report as “an outright lie.”\nIsrael says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war, and it eased its blockade in recent weeks after images of emaciated children sparked international outrage. But U.N. agencies say it’s not nearly enough, especially after Israel imposed a complete ban on food imports from early March to mid-May.\nAirstrike hits area ahead of broader offensive\nGaza City’s Shifa Hospital said at least 17 Palestinians were killed Friday as Israel escalated its activity in the area in the lead-up to its broader planned offensive.\nAn Israeli airstrike hit a school in Sheikh Radwan, a Gaza City neighborhood where tens of Palestinians shelter in makeshift tents in the schoolyard. The attack killed at least seven people, according to an eyewitness and hospital records.\nThe Israeli military said it wasn’t aware of a strike in the area but in a statement said troops were operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the Zeitoun neighborhood.\nThe strike is part of Israel’s ongoing push in Gaza City, where witnesses have reported intense bombardment in the days since Israel approved its plans to take the city.\nAmal Aboul Aas, who is now sheltering in Gaza City after being displaced four times, said the explosions were so intense she couldn’t sleep, yet she couldn’t leave either.\n“We do not have the money, the resources or the energy to evacuate again. I just wish for a quick death right where I am here because I am not going anywhere. Eventually one of these missiles will hit me,” she told The Associated Press.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Friday that at least 62,263 Palestinians have been killed in the war. Two more people have died from malnutrition-related causes, bringing the total number of such deaths to 273, including 112 children, the ministry said.\nThe ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. It does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are civilians or combatants, but it says around half were women and children. The U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel disputes its toll but has not provided its own.\nHamas-led militants started the war when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking hostages.\nMetz reported from Jerusalem. Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Michelle Price in Washington contributed.\nComments"

Reuters has previously reported on the IPC’s struggle to get access to data required to assess the crisis.\n“It is a famine that we could have prevented had we been allowed,” said U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher. “Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.”\nIsrael dismissed the findings as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\nThe report was an “outright lie”, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” he said in a statement. “Israel has a policy of preventing starvation. Since the beginning of the war Israel has enabled 2 million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip, over one ton of aid per person.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation.\nHowever, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, when asked about the IPC determination, reiterated accusations that assistance to Gaza has been looted and said Hamas was “systematically promoting a false narrative of deliberate mass starvation to put political pressure on Israel.”\n“The U.S. Government is focused on getting aid delivered to the people of Gaza. Addressing these challenging issues means honestly addressing problems for the sake of Gazans, who deserve better, not engaging in semantics,” the spokesperson said.\nFamine classification\nThe IPC — an initiative involving 21 aid groups, U.N. agencies and regional organizations funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada — has only registered famines four times previously — in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020 and in Sudan in 2024.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20 percent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Gaza famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself”.\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Turk warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime. Israel rejects war crimes charges in Gaza.\nKate Phillips-Barrasso, vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps aid agency, said it was a frustration that the IPC report was not legally binding.\n“We have photos, we have clear data, and now we have this assessment, yet it still hasn’t translated into the urgent action needed to stop people from starving,” she said.\nDiplomatic fallout\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’ propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nIn Israel, Hebrew-language news websites highlighted the famine report on their front pages, with the liberal Haaretz focused on the severity of starvation in Gaza City, while Israel Hayom, N12 and ynet emphasized Israel’s rejection of the report as biased and cited concerns over the possible diplomatic fallout.\nUnderscoring those worries, Britain called the IPC report “utterly horrifying” and demanded that Israel immediately allow unhindered supplies of food, medicines and fuel.\nBritain, Canada, Australia and many European states recently said the humanitarian crisis had reached “unimaginable levels”.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65 percent of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nThe IPC said its analysis only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nThe U.N. has complained of obstacles to delivering and distributing aid in Gaza, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel had criticized the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe Gaza war was triggered on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

      "text": "As the world's leading authority on hunger crises officially declared a catastrophic famine in Gaza, a report published Friday details how Israel has dismantled the time-tested civilian aid distribution model and replaced it with a military-based system in which many Palestinians are not only dying from starvation but are also being killed while trying to obtain food.\nForensic Architecture (FA)—a multidisciplinary research group based at Goldsmiths, University of London—and World Peace Foundation (WPF), a philanthropic organization affiliated with the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts—published The Architecture of Genocidal Starvation in Gaza, March-August 2025, \"revealing how... Israel has dismantled the proven and internationally-backed 'civilian model' of aid distribution, replacing it with a 'military model' which furthers Israel's military and political objectives in Gaza while starving the region'ss civilian population.\"\n\"Aid can be lethal when used in a manipulative way,\" an introduction to the report states. \"We have unpacked the architecture of starvation imposed by Israel in Gaza. It is composed of acts of construction and destruction: the destruction of Palestinian agriculture and food sovereignty, the destruction of Palestinian civil society, and the construction of death traps.\"\nThe report opens by noting a March 2024 provisional order by the International Court of Justice in The Hague—a product of the tribunal's ongoing genocide case against Israel filed by South Africa—directing the Israeli government to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel ignored the order and ramped up its forced starvation of Gaza.\n\"In Gaza, under the Israeli system of aid distribution, intentional mass starvation is happening on two levels, the biological starvation of individuals through the provision of starvation rations, or no rations at all,\" the report's authors wrote, as well as \"the destruction of the group as a whole, through collective dehumanization, separating the population from its land, and the disintegration of a functioning Palestinian society in Gaza.\"\nAccording to the report, Israel has dismantled the \"civilian model\" of aid distribution by:\n- Attacking essential aid infrastructure like warehouses, distribution points, kitchens, and bakeries;\n- Restricting the supply of aid into Gaza by international humanitarian organizations; and\n- Creating the conditions for aid diversion, including attacking groups tasked with securing aid routes, and failing to intervene in the diversion of aid in areas controlled by the Israeli military.\nThe report says Israel has implemented a \"dangerous and deadly\" system in which there are only four ration stations run by the\nUS-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), \"all located in military zones.\"\nDescribed by many as \"death traps,\" GHF's aid points have been the sites of regular Israeli massacres of desperate Palestinian aid-seekers. Thousands of Palestinians have been killed or wounded while trying to obtain aid in Gaza, including more than 850 people slain at or near GHF centers. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) whistleblowers have said they were ordered to fire live bullets and artillery shells into crowds of desperate aid-seekers, even when they posed no security threat—accounts corroborated by a former US special forces colonel who resigned from GHF.\nThe new report found at least 64 incidents of Palestinian civilians \"being attacked by the Israeli military while seeking aid, including 25 incidents at and around GHF ration stations,\" as well as dozens of attacks on aid infrastructure, humanitarian workers, and police.\nGaza's Government Media Office said earlier this year that more than 1,500 humanitarian workers were killed in Gaza since October 2023, including medical and civil defense personnel. The United Nations humanitarian affairs office said this week that 181 aid workers were killed while working in Gaza last year—accounting for nearly half of all such fatalities worldwide. Israel has baselessly accused many of these slain aid workers—especially employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)—of being members of Hamas or other militant groups.\nThe new report also notes that \"airdropped aid landed in active combat zones, or in densely populated areas, where airdrops have killed people, and destroyed shelters.\" Palestinians have also drowned while trying to reach aid airdropped into the Mediterranean Sea, which the IDF has prohibited Gazans from entering under penalty of death.\nFurthermore, the report's authors found that Palestinians must walk an average of more than three-and-a-half miles to the nearest GHF aid point, with such centers being open for an average of just 10 minutes at a time between June 19 and July 4.\nThe publication also highlights the 58 evacuation orders to which Gazans have been subjected. Critics have called \"evacuation\" a euphemism for ethnic cleansing. Israeli operations, including Gideon's Chariots and the newly launched Gideon's Chariots 2, are aimed at conquering Gaza and ethnically cleansing its residents to locations including a proposed concentration camp that would be built over the ruins of the southern city of Rafah.\nThe report concludes that Israel is \"instrumentalizing aid\" in order to:\n- Enforce displacement and reconcentration;\n- Make reaching aid deadly and dangerous;\n- Undermine civil order, dismantle the social fabric of Palestinian society, and dehumanize Palestinians; and\n- Permit and enable the diversion of aid.\n\"The dehumanization of Palestinians, the stripping of basic dignity, and the tearing apart of the fabric of the community are not accidental byproducts of the mass starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza,\" the report's authors assert. \"There is every reason to believe that these are what Israel intends through its militarized ration system.\"\nThe report's publication adds to the body of research on Israel's weaponized starvation—one of the alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\nEarlier this week, Amnesty International—one of a growing number of human rights defenders around the world accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza—said the country's government is \"carrying out a deliberate campaign of starvation in the occupied Gaza Strip, systematically destroying the health, well-being, and social fabric of Palestinian life.\"\nLast month, WPF executive director Alex de Waal, a leading global authority on famine, asserted that \"there is no case since World War II of starvation that is being so minutely designed and controlled\" as Israel is doing in Gaza.\n\"This is preventable starvation. It is entirely man-made,\" de Waal added. \"And every stage of this has been predicted, and at every stage action could have been taken—by Israel, by the international authorities, [the] international community, those who back Israel—to prevent what is happening now... Those steps have simply not been taken.\""

A 21st-century famine watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history. It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war. It is a famine on all of our watch … a famine that will and must haunt us all.”\nSome 280,000 of the affected Palestinians are in a northern region covering Gaza City – known as Gaza governorate – which the IPC said was now in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nIt is the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but that limited data prevented any precise classification. Reuters has previously reported on the IPC's struggle to get access to data required to assess the crisis.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine, at least 20 per cent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nPreviously, the IPC has only registered famines in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. Cogat, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’s propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nIsrael has long counted on the United States, its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65 per cent of Americans believe the US should help those starving in Gaza. Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Mr Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there is no starvation.\nThe IPC said its analysis only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data, and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region, as it is largely uninhabited.\nThe Gaza war was triggered on 7 October 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. The Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that at least 62,192 Palestinians have been killed in the war.\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!\nThe world’s leading food insecurity authority has officially declared famine in Gaza, after officials finally determined that Israel’s almost two year long, near-total blockade on the 2 million Palestinians in the Strip has created conditions so horrific they surpass those needed for a famine declaration.\nThe UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed that famine is occurring in Gaza in a report on Friday.\n“As of 15 August 2025, Famine (IPC Phase 5) — with reasonable evidence – is confirmed in Gaza Governorate,” the group said, referring to the region of Gaza encompassing Gaza City and surrounding areas. The experts said famine conditions are expected to spread to the areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of September, barring a complete cessation of Israel and the U.S.’s starvation campaign.\nStay in the loop\nNever miss the news and analysis you care about.\nThe group said that over half a million Palestinians are facing Phase 5 food insecurity, which is the group’s most dire classification, of “catastrophe” or “famine.” About 1.1 million Palestinians, roughly half the population, are experiencing Phase 4 “emergency” levels of hunger, while the remaining population of roughly 200,000 are experiencing a food “crisis,” of Phase 3.\nIsrael’s famine “is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment — and a failure of humanity itself,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. “Famine is not about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival.”\nExperts have long pointed out that conditions must be extremely dire for the IPC to classify a famine, as the group can only do so in response to escalated mortality and starvation rates. For months, Palestinians have pleaded for the entry of food, and humanitarian groups have warned of famine. But instead of allowing more aid, Israel and the U.S. came up with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) scheme that made getting food a death trap.\nAn official famine declaration is distinct from a Phase 5 classification. In order for the IPC to declare a famine, three criteria must be met. A fifth of the households in the area must be facing an “extreme lack of food”; 30 percent of children must be suffering from acute malnutrition; and the mortality rate for non-trauma deaths must be two adults per 10,000, or four children per 10,000 daily. The child malnutrition condition may also be met when 15 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition as measured by the circumference of their arms.\nThe IPC has only declared a famine five times since it was established in 2004; once in Somalia, twice in South Sudan, and once in Sudan last year. The declaration in Gaza marks the first time it has ever been declared outside of the continent of Africa.\nIPC noted that many of the elements of the famine in Gaza are unprecedented.\n“Never before has the [Famine Review Committee] had to return so many times to the same crisis; a stark reflection of how suffering has not only persisted but intensified and spread until famine has begun to emerge,” the group wrote in its report.\n“As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed,” it went on.\nIsrael has escalated its starvation campaign in recent months, implementing a total aid blockade for nearly three months starting in March, then pivoting to the GHF scheme where Israel rounds up Palestinians into distribution sites just to massacre them on a near-daily basis.\nGaza health officials have recorded nearly 300 deaths, including over 100 children, to starvation amid the genocide, most of them in recent weeks; the health ministry reported that two people had died in the past 24 hours in Gaza on Friday. IPC’s report notes that these deaths are likely underreported due to Israel’s destruction of monitoring and health systems.\nIsraeli officials and their propaganda network have denied that there is starvation in Gaza at all. These claims have been thoroughly debunked not just by humanitarian experts, but also, perhaps more importantly, by Palestinians in Gaza who say that famine and starvation is all around them, stalking everyone, adult or child.\nStarvation is a critical part of Israel’s goal of inflicting conditions designed to bring about Palestinians’ physical destruction, as Amnesty International wrote earlier this month — and a key element of Israel’s genocide.\n“In Gaza, survival has been redefined. It is no longer just about fleeing bombs — it is about keeping ourselves from dying of hunger. The echoing question — ‘Where do we go?’ — has now been compounded by another, more desperate one: ‘What can we eat so we don’t collapse?’” wrote Palestinian Hend Salama Abo Helow this month.\nAs the occupying power exercising total control of everything that enters and exits Gaza, Israel has long deprived Palestinians of food and other basic needs in the Strip. For decades, humanitarian groups have warned of widespread food insecurity in Gaza, as well as shortages of water and other human needs as a result of Israel’s blockades.\nAn urgent appeal for your support\nTruthout relies on reader support to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.\nUnfortunately, donations are down.

      "text": "Section Branding\nHeader Content\nFamine is declared in Gaza: What does it take to make this pronouncement?\nPrimary Content\nAfter weeks of rising concern about hunger in Gaza, a United Nations-backed panel has declared that famine is underway in northern Gaza, warning that more than half a million people are on the brink of starvation as hunger spreads deeper into the densely populated Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed on Friday that famine has taken hold in the Gaza Governorate, encompassing Gaza City and nearby areas, and warned it could extend to central and southern Gaza by late September.\nThe declaration comes nearly two years into an armed conflict with Israel that was triggered by the October 7 invasion by Hamas. Israeli restrictions have limited the flow of food and aid into Gaza. Israel has long disputed claims about food insecurity in Gaza.\nWorld Food Programme's Director of Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Jean-Martin Bauer noted that when a famine is declared, it means there is documentation of widespread starvation, widespread illness and widespread mortality.\nBut the declaration of famine is a complicated process.\nHere are five key points about the steps leading up to such a declaration.\nThere's a very specific, internationally-agreed upon system for gauging hunger crises\nThe system the world relies on to track food emergencies began in the 1980s, said Tim Hoffine, now Deputy Chief of Party-Innovation at the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). In response to famines in East and West Africa, U.S. aid officials realized the need for a way to monitor global hunger. The goal, Hoffine said, was to provide \"independent, timely and evidence-based analysis\" to help decision makers prevent future famines.\nThat led to the founding in 1985 of FEWS NET by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to contract experts to collect and analyze data on at-risk areas monthly.\nStill, there was no universal standard to define the severity of hunger crises — making coordination among donors and aid groups difficult.\nAs former World Food Programme spokesperson Steve Taravella put it, \"There is a serious need for the aid community to understand the levels of hunger in a scientific, authoritative way ... We needed something reliable and authoritative that everybody working on these issues could use as a baseline.\"\nSo in 2004, during a food emergency in Somalia, FEWS NET and international partners developed the \"Integrated Food Security Phase Classification\" initiative — or IPC.\n\"It's a mouthful of humanitarian jargon,\" Taravella said, \"but it's basically the authoritative, respected, scientific mechanism for measuring levels of hunger in different areas.\"\nThe IPC is coordinated by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome but brings together working groups of experts to analyze each crisis individually.\n\"Donors wanted a single estimate of need,\" Hoffine said. \"And the IPC responded to that desire for consensus.\"\nMultiple conditions need to be met before a location is technically considered in \"famine\"\nThe IPC categorizes hunger on a five-phase scale. FEWS NET, which monitors hunger hotspots monthly, also uses this system.\nPhase one means conditions are normal. In phase two, communities are \"stressed\" — still eating enough, but many households struggle to afford other essentials.\nAt phase three — a \"crisis\" level — \"that's where we start getting nervous,\" Taravella said. People begin to have trouble getting enough food. \"They might not have meals as often.\" Many turn to short-term coping strategies that undermine long-term survival, like selling off livestock.\nIn phase four — \"emergency\" — hardships deepen. Food gaps widen, and people resort to \"really extreme forms of coping,\" Hoffine said. That might mean liquidating nearly all assets or eating seeds needed for future planting. Rates of acute malnutrition and excess deaths rise.\nOnly in phase five is a location considered in \"famine.\" Three criteria must be met: at least 20% of households face \"catastrophe,\" meaning, Hoffine explained, \"an extreme lack of food that ... leads to acute malnutrition and mortality.\"\nSecond, at least 30% of children under five suffer from acute malnutrition, or wasting. Third, at least two of every 10,000 adults die each day from non-trauma causes. As Hoffine noted, hunger often kills not just through starvation, but by weakening immune systems to the point where people can't fight off disease.\nFriday's IPC analysis says Gaza City and surrounding areas are experiencing a Phase 5 famine, the highest level of acute food insecurity.\nFEWS NET lacks an operational presence in Gaza, posing potential challenges to monitoring acute food insecurity, but it says its analysis methods remain consistent with its standard project-wide practices.\nSome areas in Sudan have been declared to be facing famine conditions since 2024. Parts of South Sudan were declared in famine in 2020 and 2017.\nThere's an even higher bar for actually declaring a famine\nEven if FEWS NET or the IPC determine that a location meets all three famine criteria, they can't declare it on their own. Their findings must be reviewed and approved by a committee of independent experts convened by the IPC.\nStill, neither FEWS NET nor the IPC makes the official declaration. \"It's up to government institutions, United Nations upper leadership, and other high-level representatives to actually make a famine declaration,\" Hoffine said.\nStarvation can occur long before famine is declared\nBecause all three thresholds must be met to trigger a famine designation, many people may be starving well before phase five is reached.\n\"Until famine thresholds are breached, you would still have people dying from hunger or hunger-related mortality,\" Hoffine explained. \"So in Gaza you would still expect there to be mortality. And the longer this goes without a solution, the more that we can expect that sort of mortality to occur.\"\nIt's not too late to take action in Gaza — but time is running short\nHoffine and Taravella emphasized the caveats in their organizations' reports are critical. Both FEWS NET and IPC say famine in Gaza can be alleviated if hostilities cease and aid workers are granted full access.\nThat's the goal of the famine classification system: to alert the world before it's too late. While higher-phase designations don't mandate action, they are powerful tools for mobilizing a response, Taravella said. \"It puts the world on notice.\"\nHe cited WFP chief economist Arif Husain: \"Several years ago, when [famines] happened in certain places, you could say, 'I'm sorry. I did not know.' Today we see crises in real time. So we cannot say we did not know.\"\nMeanwhile, a famine declaration can carry weight, increasing pressure on governments and agencies to ramp up aid and on Israel to allow full humanitarian access. It could also lead to diplomatic fallout.\nFEWS NET said in a Friday statement: \"Many months of starvation have already resulted in high levels of mortality and left many others so weakened that even with aid, high numbers of deaths will continue for months. This grim reality highlights why early intervention is so essential: Famine can still be slowed, but it should never be allowed to take hold in the first place.\""

A famine was projected in Yemen in 2018, but did not materialise, a spokesman told AFP.\n'Haunt us all'\nThe IPC said the crisis was \"entirely man-made\", driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should \"haunt us all\".\n\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" he said.\nGaza's largest hospital struggles to function in 'catastrophic' health situation\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war, the release of all hostages taken by Hamas from Israel, and full humanitarian access to Gaza.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,\" he said.\n'Too weak to cry'\nChildren are particularly hard hit by the lack of food.\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.\n\"The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,\" said Unicef executive director Catherine Russell.\nThe local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98 percent of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said. Livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.\nThe severe deterioration of the health system and the lack of safe drinking water and adequate hygiene compound the crisis.\nGathering information is extremely difficult in Gaza.\nThe IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.\nIsrael's foreign ministry rejected the IPC's assessment as \"political\" and asserted that a \"massive influx of aid\" had entered the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.\nThe Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, COGAT, accused the authors of relying on \"partial data\" and ignoring information provided to them.\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning\nSubscribe"

It's become a reality in the case of Gaza City. Now, the IPC's formally confirmed that a famine is taking place, and this only takes place when three critical thresholds are met. The first one is extreme food deprivation, the second is acute malnutrition rates and the third is the level of starvation-related deaths. Now, all three have now been breached in Gaza City, and that means that there's massive starvation, destitution and death.\nWhat the report also says is that these conditions could also expand and cover two more governorates in Gaza - Deir al-Balah and Khan Yunis. And this is within the next few weeks.\nSUMMERS: As we mentioned, a number of leaders in Israel, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have said famine is not there - food shortages are due to Hamas stealing food. Your response to that?\nBAUER: Look, the - if we look at extreme food deprivation, the data we have shows that very severe hunger has tripled in Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City, since - so this is between May and July. For malnutrition among children, it's accelerating at a catastrophic pace. Malnutrition levels in Gaza City have tripled between May and July. And what experts are saying is that collapsing health system, untreated illness and the surge in child disease are pushing death rates higher.\nThis is the IPC. These findings were reviewed by a group of experts - a group of independent experts called the Famine Review Committee. They looked at everything in detail, and they are telling us today that there is a famine taking place in Gaza governorate, which includes Gaza City, and that it could spread. The IPC is the gold standard in terms of international food security analysis.\nSUMMERS: You've underscored that a famine declaration is significant, but if Israel refuses to let aid into Gaza, and if countries like the United States do not find ways to hold Israel accountable, what will actually change for the people there in northern Gaza, who you say are at a tipping point right now?\nBAUER: Well, addressing famine in Gaza will require not only food, but also urgent medical support, emergency nutrition. And what actually we've seen in the history of this crisis is that when there is a ceasefire, conditions do improve. If we go back to the month of February, food prices in Gaza had gone way down. The same indicators that we've been monitoring since the start of this crisis were a lot better than they are today. So when humanitarians are given a chance to respond, the situation does improve.\nThe problem in the present scenario of famine in Gaza City is that we have this exponential increase in acute malnutrition, which is extremely complex to treat. And once you're in these uncharted waters, the - it's not as easy as just letting trucks in. That - malnutrition takes weeks to treat. It's a slow burn, and unfortunately t, hat's been triggered already. And this is a new facet to a very complex crisis in Gaza.\nSUMMERS: Look ahead to us, now that this declaration of famine has occurred, to what might come next for the people there in Gaza and what they're experiencing.\nBAUER: The people in Gaza are experiencing a prolonged food crisis which started in 2023, with moments where things got better, including the ceasefire I mentioned earlier this year. And what we hopefully see is conditions on the ground improving for humanitarian actors, improving for the health sector. And that would only happen with an end to the hostilities. The situation right now is appalling, and the fact that a famine has been confirmed today should call us all to act. This is - in the words of the emergency coordinator of the U.N. - a stain on our conscience.\nSUMMERS: I do want to ask you what you have been hearing from your people there on the ground as they work to provide resources to people there. What are they saying to you?\nBAUER: They're saying that there's a desperation, that they see malnourished children on the ground. It's also a very difficult time for the humanitarians trying to bring assistance.\nSUMMERS: We've been speaking with Jean-Martin Bauer. He's the director of food security and nutrition analysis for the World Food Programme. Thank you so much.\nBAUER: Thank you.\nCopyright © 2025 NPR. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Riyadh: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) on Friday, August 22, voiced deep concern following the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report confirming famine in the Gaza Strip, condemning what it described as genocide committed by Israeli forces against civilians.\nIn a statement, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is “a direct result of the absence of mechanisms to deter and hold accountable the repeated crimes of the Israeli occupation.”\nIt warned that such crimes “will remain a stain on the brow of the international community, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, unless swift action is taken to end the famine and stop the war of extermination against the Palestinian people.”\nEarlier on Friday, the IPC, a global hunger monitor, confirmed that famine has already struck northern Gaza and will likely spread further within weeks.\nAccording to its findings, about 514,000 people—nearly a quarter of the enclave’s population—are facing famine, with numbers expected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September. Roughly 280,000 of those affected live in Gaza City and its surroundings, while the rest are concentrated in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, areas predicted to slip into famine conditions by next month.\nThe announcement by the International Hunger Watch comes as Israel prepares a large-scale military operation to occupy Gaza City, a move that threatens to worsen the humanitarian disaster and push the situation beyond control.\nAccording to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 269 people, including 112 children, have already died of starvation.\nSince March, Israel has tightened restrictions on aid and, from May, channelled limited supplies through the so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).” Deadly incidents around distribution points have left thousands dead and injured."

      "text": "The world’s leading authority on food insecurity has confirmed a famine in Gaza.\nIn a report published Friday, the United Nations-backed group of experts finds that over half a million people parts of north Gaza are at risk of dying from starvation, and hundreds of thousands more people face catastrophic shortages as the famine spreads to other areas.\n“As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report says.\nThe images of skeletal children in Gaza have already caused widespread protests around the world against the Israeli offensive there and prompted some of Israel’s most important Western allies to say they will recognize a Palestinian state. The IPC report brings the facts behind those photographs of starvation into stark relief.\nIt says famine, the most extreme classification of hunger, is occurring in Gaza Governorate and projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates by the end of September.\nDescribing the situation as a “race against time,” the report says at least 132,000 children under the age of 5 could die from acute malnutrition in the coming months.\nThis estimate has doubled since an IPC report in May, showing just how drastically the conditions have worsened in Gaza in recent weeks.\nNearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require an urgent nutrition response.\nThe Ministry of Health in Gaza said Thursday 271 people have so far died in the famine, including 112 children.\nThis is the first time famine has been confirmed in the Middle East. And it’s happened in a 25-mile-long strip of land, where trucks piled with thousands of tons of food are parked at border crossings.\nThe people in Gaza now dying of starvation are never more than a few miles from warehouses filled with food aid that they have no way to reach.\n“This is the direct result of months of deliberate restrictions on aid, the destruction of Gaza’s food, health, and water systems, and relentless bombardment,” Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps, said in response to the statement. “This is a man-made catastrophe, entirely preventable and entirely unconscionable.”\nIsrael was quick to respond to the report. Israel’s Foreign Ministry accused the IPC of publishing “a tailor-made report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign.” It claims “there is no famine in Gaza.” The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, said the report is based “partial and unreliable sources, many of them affiliated with Hamas.” The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted point-by-point arguments against the report, including allegations that it “ignores Israel’s humanitarian efforts and Hamas’s systematic theft.”\nThe Israeli government has repeatedly said its restrictions on aid are to pressure Hamas and prevent its fighters from benefiting from it.\nBut the result has been a breakdown in the aid system for Gaza’s population living under Israeli blockade, even before this war.\nEarlier this month, more than 100 international humanitarian organizations, including Caritas, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders, accused Israel of “weaponizing” aid to help achieve its aims in Gaza. The statement from Aug. 13 said, “Despite claims by Israeli authorities that there is no limit on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, most major international NGOs have been unable to deliver a single truck of lifesaving supplies since 2 March.”\nThey said their operations are hampered by new, more restrictive Israeli regulations for international aid groups, which they say have resulted in Israeli authorities denying dozens of permissions for groups to bring their aid into Gaza. “This obstruction has left millions of dollars’ worth of food, medicine, water, and shelter items stranded in warehouses across Jordan and Egypt, while Palestinians are being starved,” the statement said.\nOn July 29, an IPC alert warned that the “worst-case scenario of famine” was playing out in the Gaza Strip. It underscored the devastating living situation for Gaza’s some 2 million citizens, almost two years since the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prompted a full-scale Israeli military invasion of Gaza.\nAfter Israel tightened restrictions on supplies entering Gaza in mid-March, food dried up. In the weeks that followed, adults prioritized feeding their children over themselves as a coping strategy, which, according to the IPC alert, initially mitigated a rise in acute child malnutrition.\nHowever, by April, supplies had become so scarce that parents could no longer protect their children this way. The IPC alert said that between April and mid-July, over 20,000 children had to be treated for acute malnutrition.\nWhat little sustenance could be found in markets skyrocketed in price. In June, wheat flour prices increased between 1,400% and 5,600% compared to late February. By July, the IPC alert stated nearly 9 out of 10 households had to resort to taking “significant safety risks” to find food and scavenge from garbage.\nThe U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres posted his response to the report on social media. “Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine’,” the U.N. chief said. “This is not a mystery — it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself.”\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was “utterly horrifying” and held Israel responsible. “The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage,” Lammy said in a statement.\nHundreds of civilians have been reported shot dead as they cross dangerous militarized zones to receive supplies from the aid distribution sites of the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The foundation disputes that the killings occur near its centers and says it has distributed 132 million meals.\nBut aid experts say that much of what the group gives out is not ready-to-eat and requires water and fuel for cooking — resources that are hard to come by in Gaza, where Israeli bombardment has devastated critical infrastructure.\nMoreover, experts say the distribution sites are located primarily in militarized zones along the Khan Younis–Rafah border, where less than a quarter of Gaza’s population lives.\nFinding food and resources for cooking has been made all the more difficult by the frequent and often repeated forced displacements of families across the Gaza Strip. The IPC report said some 800,000 people have had to leave their homes in waves of displacement that have forced people to abandon any remaining resources, further disrupted access to essential health services and compounded humanitarian needs.\nThe confirmation of famine comes as Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for Israeli soldiers and 60,000 reservists to move into Gaza City.\nThe U.N. says that already nearly 90% of Gaza is under military control or off-limits to Palestinians. Gaza City is home to tens of thousands of Gazans displaced from other parts of the strip and has several of the territory’s last partially functioning hospitals. The Israeli military has started calling doctors and international organizations in the city, telling them to leave.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel will now resume negotiations for the release of all hostages held in Gaza and an end to the nearly 2-year-old war, but on terms acceptable to Israel. It comes in response to a temporary ceasefire proposal put forward by Egypt and Qatar that Hamas accepted on Monday.\nIsrael will dispatch negotiators to talks once a location is set, an Israeli official said. Netanyahu, however, also said he remained set on approving plans for capturing Gaza City.\nThe talks could offer a moment’s hope to Palestinians desperate for a ceasefire that the experts behind the IPC report say is so desperately needed as a first step to address the famine in Gaza.\nBut for now, the situation in the enclave remains desperate. The United Nations’ World Food Programme said in a recent report that “public order has broken down” and that “after 22 months of fighting, the social fabric of Gaza is collapsing as the fear of starvation intensifies.”\nAlmost all the trucks carrying WFP food aid inside Gaza have been stopped before reaching their destination by civilians desperate to find the sustenance they need for themselves and their families to survive."

      "text": "The United Nations officially declared a famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming \"systematic obstruction\" of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of war, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly dismissing the findings.\nPalestinian militant group Hamas urged the United Nations to \"stop the war and lift the siege\", calling for unrestricted access for food, medicine, water and fuel.\nNetanyahu, whose defence minister meanwhile threatened an even more intense offensive, rejected the UN-backed report as \"an outright lie\".\nThe Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in the Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory including Gaza City.\nIsrael has pressed ahead with plans to seize Gaza City despite an international outcry, saying that taking the territory's largest city is key to defeating Hamas.\nThe IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, covering around two-thirds of Gaza.\nWith the vast majority of the territory's population displaced at least once, the UN said nearly a million people currently live in the northern Gaza governorate.\nUN agencies and aid groups had warned for months of a looming famine in Gaza, where Israel has severely restricted aid and at times completely cut it off during its nearly two-year war with Hamas.\nCOGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories -- including coordinating aid to Gaza -- argued that the IPC's findings rely on \"partial data and unreliable sources\".\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to Palestinians in need \"because of systematic obstruction by Israel\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire, saying: \"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.\"\n- 'Man-made catastrophe' -\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk said it was \"a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\" -- a charge for which the International Criminal Court in November issued an arrest warrants for Netanyahu.\nIn a statement, Netanyahu said \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation\", citing figures on aid it had allowed into Gaza.\nThe IPC report said that \"over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death\".\nIt said the deterioration between July and August was the most severe since it began analysing hunger in Gaza, driven by a sharp escalation in the war and restrictions on supplies.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid from Gaza for two months.\nSpeaking in Geneva, the UN's Fletcher said: \"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said the famine declaration \"must serve as a catalyst for immediate and concrete action\".\nBritain's top diplomat David Lammy said Israel's \"refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.\"\n- 'We are dying' -\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz earlier warned that \"the gates of hell will open upon\" Hamas leaders, specifically in Gaza City, \"until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war, primarily the release of all hostages and their disarmament.\"\nMilitary chief Eyal Zamir said \"we are expanding operations in Gaza in the coming days\".\nLate Thursday, Netanyahu said he had ordered negotiations aimed at freeing the hostages still held in Gaza since the Hamas attack that triggered the war -- 49 people, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.\nThe Israeli premier said the diplomatic push would accompany the operation to take control of Gaza City.\nMediators have been waiting for an official Israeli response to their latest ceasefire proposal, which Hamas accepted earlier this week.\nOn the ground, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 57 people on Friday, more than half of them in Gaza City.\nUmm Mohammed Nasr, a 42-year-old mother of four from Gaza City, said that \"the bombing hasn't stopped since this morning... but we have no idea where to go\".\n\"We are dying,\" she said.\nMedia restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency or the Israeli military.\nHamas's October 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.\nglp-ds/ami/jsa\n(0) comments\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nKeep it Clean.

      "text": "UN-backed report declaring famine in Gaza ‘important’ but won’t change much\nDeclaring a famine in Gaza is important but won’t bring any short-term relief to the Palestinian population, experts said in reaction to the UN-backed food security body that declared famine in the northern part of the territory on Friday.\nFamine has been declared in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, which is used by governments and international aid agencies to identify hunger levels around the world.\n“I do think it’s important that the IPC has confirmed that a famine is happening in Gaza, though this does not come as a surprise,” said Anne Saab, professor of international law at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\n“The question is to whom does it matter, how does it matter and when does it matter? Will it make a difference to the people dying now? No. IPC confirmation of a famine makes it increasingly difficult for Western governments to deny what is happening, and it gives more leverage to urge Western governments to act. It matters also for accountability.”\nFamine affects the administrative district of Gaza, which includes the city of Gaza, the analysis said.\nAccording to the report, the lives of 132,000 children under the age of five are especially at risk due to malnutrition. Of these, 41,000 are considered to be particularly serious cases, twice as many as in the previous assessment in May.\nResponding to the report, Israel’s foreign ministry said there was no famine in Gaza.\nIt accused the IPC of publishing a “tailor-made fabricated report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign”.\nRead more: Famine confirmed in Gaza for first time, says UN-backed report\nMore\nFamine confirmed in Gaza for first time, says UN-backed report\nNot a surprise\nThe report comes after months of repeated warnings by NGOs and UN organisations of dire humanitarian conditions throughout the Gaza Strip. In mid-March Israel imposed a six-week blockade on all food, aid and medical supplies to Gaza, making already catastrophic conditions on the ground even worse.\nUnder international pressure Israel allowed more aid to enter Gaza at the end of May, which it distributes via the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). To date, some 2,000 Palestinians have been killed while accessing food, according to UN figures.\nSince June, NGOs and the UN have warned the amount of aid entering Gaza was not nearly enough to avert wide-spread starvation among the population.\nThree criteria must be met before a famine can be declared: at least 20% of households are affected by an extreme food shortage, at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition, and at least two adults or four children per 10,000 inhabitants die every day from hunger or due to the combination of malnutrition and disease.\nThe IPC initiative was founded in 2004. Its members include almost two dozen UN organisations and aid agencies. It is responsible for assessing hunger situations around the world. On the IPC scale, there are five levels of food security in a country or region. The highest – and worst – is level five: “catastrophe/famine”. Below this, the term ‘hunger crisis’ is used. Until now, level four (“emergency”) applied to the entire Gaza.\n“It is a famine that we repeatedly warned of, but that the international media has not been allowed in to cover to bear witness,” Tom Fletcher, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator,said on Friday during a regular press briefing at the United Nations in Geneva.\n“It is a famine in 2025. A 21st-century famine watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history. It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war.”\nRead more: In May experts at the UN warned of imminent famine in Gaza.\nMore\nHumanitarian community sounds the alarm over famine risks in Gaza\nThe report comes after Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the Isreali army would take over Gaza city, a move NGOs said would further increase starvation among the population.\nIsrael’s defence minister said on Friday Gaza City would be destroyed if Hamas did not agree to disarm and release all hostages.\nIsrael believes that only 20 of the 50 hostages are still alive after 22 months of war.\n“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,” said António Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN in a statement on Friday.\n“No more excuses.

Starvation is a war crime, and in the circumstances it most certainly constitutes a crime against humanity and forms part of the unfolding genocide in Gaza,” said Nico Krisch, professor of international law at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.\nIsrael has repeatedly rejected all accusations of genocide.\n“Starvation as a weapon of war plays an important role both in the ICC [International Criminal Court] and ICJ cases, and the confirmation of famine adds force to these arguments,” Anne Saab said.\nIn November 2024 the International Court of Justice issued arrests warrants for Netanyahu and two other senior Israeli officials alleging responsibility for the crimes against humanity and using starvation as a method of warfare.\nEdited by Imogen Foulkes/livm/ts\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative\nYou can find an overview of ongoing debates with our journalists here .

      "text": "A UN-backed body has officially declared famine in Gaza for the first time, causing outrage around the globe – including within the UK government.\nAccording to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said 514,000 people in the Palestinian territory are experiencing famine.\nThat’s approximately a quarter of Gaza’s entire population.\nThe IPC expect this number to rise to 614,000 by the end of September.\nMore than half (around 280,000) of those suffering these severe levels of hunger are based in the northern region covering Gaza City, also called the Gaza governorate.\nAt least 20% of a region has to be suffering from extreme food shortages for it to be called a famine.\nIt usually means one in three children is acutely malnourished, while a further two in every 10,000 people are dying every day from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nThe UN human rights agency said today that the famine is a direct result of Israel’s actions and therefore could amount to a war crime.\nFamine is not a very common occurrence. Previous famines were declared in Somalia in 2011, and in Sudan in 2017, 2020, and 2024.\nA new report from Forensic Architecture and the World Peace Foundation also accused Israel of worsening starvation with a “military model” of aid distribution on Friday.\nThe UK’s foreign secretary David Lammy released a statement today calling the conditions in Gaza a “moral outrage”.\nRead Lammy’s full statement here:\n“The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable.\nThe Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.\nThe IPC report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children. The Government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those who so desperately need them.\nThe Israeli government must allow the UN and international NGOs to carry out their life-saving work without obstruction. Aid must reach those in need urgently and without delay.\nWe desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine.\nThe UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the hostages held by Hamas. We urge the Israeli government to change course and halt its plans.\nThis terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace.”\nLammy was not alone in his fury.\nThe UN’s secretary-general Antonio Guterres wrote on X: “Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine.’”\nHe said it is “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself”.\n“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law — including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,” Guterres said.\n“No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow — it is now. We need an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages and full, unfettered humanitarian access.”\nThe CEO of Save the Children UK, Moazzam Malik, called for “this siege and weaponisation of aid” to end, and for the British government to suspend all arms transfers to Israel.\nHelen Stawski, Oxfam’s policy lead, hit out at Israel too, saying the country has been “denying almost every request from long-established humanitarian agencies, prevent ing them from delivering vital food”.\nShe added: “Oxfam alone has more than $2.5m worth of life-saving aid, including high-calorie food packages – now sitting in warehouses outside Gaza. Israeli authorities have rejected it all, at a time when it is needed more than ever.”\nPlan International UK said the famine was an “entirely man-made hunger catastrophic that is killing Gaza children every day”.\nA nutritional expert working for CARE International, Samah Wadi, in Gaza, said people in the territory are “looking for anything to survive on, to hold onto, even if it means it will only save them for another couple of hours”.\nIsraeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely rejected the famine conclusion.\nWriting on X, she accused the IPC of “amplifying data sourced from Hamas, a designated terrorist organization”.\nShe said: “It is illogical to suggest the situation is worsening when clear evidence shows improvement. This is yet another example of disinformation, promoted by UN agencies and echoed by the media, which only serves Hamas’s propaganda campaign.”\nIsrael has also accused Hamas of stealing aid, an allegation it denies.\nGlobal frustration with Israel is still building, though.\nThe UK joined EU allies and Australia to condemn Israel’s other new plan to construct a settlement east of Jerusalem, known as the E1 area, on Thursday.\nIn a joint statement, each country’s foreign minister – including Lammy – said the plan is “unacceptable and a violation of international law”.\nThe UK’s minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer also said this week that the humanitarian crisis had “reached new depths”.\nHe said: “Israel must immediately and permanently lift all barriers preventing aid reaching the people of Gaza to prevent the horrifying starvation in the Strip continuing.\n“The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached new depths and that is why we are doing all we can to end the current suffering and change the situation on the ground.\n“We continue to support efforts to bring about an immediate ceasefire. We also need a comprehensive plan to end this misery and get to a long-term settlement that provides peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.”\nA new investigation from the Guardian, +972 Magazine and Local Call found this week that five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians – even though Israel claimed it was working to wipe out Hamas militants."

My youngest child is four years old - he doesn't know what fruit and vegetables look or taste like.\"\nThe UN says Israel has heavily restricted the amount of aid entering Gaza, which Israel denies.\nIsrael also denies there is starvation in the territory, in direct contradiction to what more than 100 humanitarian groups, witnesses on the ground, and multiple UN bodies say.\nOn Friday, the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City and its surrounding areas.\nIt warned that more than half a million people across the Gaza Strip were facing \"catastrophic\" conditions characterised by \"starvation, destitution and death\".\nRajaa Talbeh, 47, a mother of six, said she had lost 25kg (55lbs) in weight. She fled her home in Gaza City's Zeitoun district a month ago and now lives in a makeshift tent near the beach.\nShe suffers from gluten intolerance and said she could no longer find food she could eat.\n\"Before the war, a charity used to help me get gluten-free products, which I could never afford myself,\" she said.\n\"Since the war began, I can't find what I need in the market, and even when I do, I can't afford it. Isn't it enough to face daily bombardment, displacement and living in a tent that shields us neither from the heat of summer nor the cold of winter - and now famine on top of it?\"\nRida Hijeh, 29, said her five-year-old daughter Lamia's weight had dropped from 19kg (42lbs) to 10.5kg (23lbs).\nShe said Lamia was healthy before the war began and had no prior illnesses.\n\"This all happened only because of the famine,\" she said.\n\"There is simply nothing for the child to eat. There are no vegetables, no fruits.\"\nNow, Lamia suffers from swelling in her legs, thinning hair, and nerve problems, she said.\n\"She cannot walk. I went to many clinics, doctors, and hospitals. They all told me my daughter is suffering from malnutrition. But none of them gave me anything, not treatment, not any support.\"\nMandy Blackman, a British nurse working for the charity UK-Med in Gaza, said 70% of mothers attending their maternal health, ante-natal and post-natal clinics had clinical malnutrition.\n\"Babies are delivered smaller and more vulnerable as a result,\" she said.\nMore than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its military campaign, in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nSince the start of the war, at least 271 people, including 112 children, have died of \"famine and malnutrition\", according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nAnother woman, Aseel, who lives in Gaza City, said: \"Five months ago, I weighed 56kg (123lbs). Today, I weigh only 46kg (101lbs).\"\nShe said she hadn't eaten a single piece of fruit or meat in months and had spent nearly her entire savings on basic ingredients to survive.\nAseel's sister-in-law - who she lives with - has a one-month-old baby.\n\"She's been desperately searching for baby formula at a reasonable price,\" Aseel said.\nShe said that when they can find it, it costs as much as 180 shekels (£39) per can.\n\"I have no food stockpile, not even enough to last a week or two,\" she added.\n\"Like thousands of people, we live day by day.\"\nAdditional reporting by Freya Scott-Turner and Caroline Hawley"

This famine is the direct consequence of Israel’s deliberate campaign of starvation in Gaza.\n“It is all the more harrowing that this famine is an entirely man-made, deliberately orchestrated and preventable catastrophe. The deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid, the destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure, and the direct killings of civilians are a clear manifestation of how Israel is inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as part of its ongoing genocide.\nThis famine is the direct consequence of Israel’s deliberate campaign of starvation in Gaza.\nErika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International\nIt is all the more harrowing that [it] is an entirely man-made, deliberately orchestrated and preventable catastrophe\n“The declaration of famine in Gaza City comes as the Israeli cabinet and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have approved plans for a new military operation to ‘take control’ of the city, further entrenching Israel’s unlawful occupation. Launching such an offensive amidst an ongoing famine would not only lead to yet more mass violations of international humanitarian law, but would also deliberately, exponentially intensify the suffering of Palestinians already enduring starvation and rising death tolls from malnutrition.\n“With every hour that passes without decisive international action, more Palestinian lives are lost, and Gaza City edges closer to complete annihilation. History will never forgive us for standing by as emaciated children die, while food remains just miles away, yet blocked by Israel.\n“To even begin reversing the devastating consequences of Israel’s inhumane policies and actions, the world must take action now. All states and actors must forcefully demand that Israel ends this abomination by ensuring the unimpeded flow of aid into and across Gaza, a total lifting of Israel’s illegal blockade, dismantling the deadly militarized aid distribution system and allowing the UN and other trusted humanitarian organizations to distribute aid safely and without arbitrary restrictions. They must also press for an immediate sustained ceasefire by all parties and the rapid return of the hostages held in Gaza as well as of all Palestinians arbitrarily detained by Israel.”"

      "text": "United Nations declares famine in northern Gaza\nAn immediate ceasefire is critical to allow a large-scale humanitarian response that can save lives, the UN said.\nThe United Nations on Friday formally declared a famine in northern Gaza, the first ever confirmed in West Asia.\nThe famine conditions are predicted to spread from the Gaza Governorate to the Deir Al Balah and Khan Younis regions of the besieged Palestinian territory in the coming weeks, the UN cited a new Integrated Food Security Phase Classification analysis as saying in a statement.\nMore than half a million people in the region are trapped in famine conditions, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths, it added.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification is a standardised tool that combines data on food security, nutrition and livelihoods to assess the severity of crises and guide response.\n“Classifying famine means that the most extreme category is triggered when three critical thresholds, extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition and starvation-related deaths, have been breached,” the UN said.\nIsrael’s military offensive in Gaza began in October 2023 after the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,200 persons during its incursion into southern Israel and took hostages. Israel has been carrying out unprecedented air and ground strikes on Gaza since then, leaving more than 62,000 persons dead.\nTel Aviv has enforced a blockade on humanitarian aid, which the UN previously said had brought the population to the brink of famine.\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children in Gaza were identified as acutely malnourished. This was the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year, the UN said on Friday.\nNearly one in four of these children is suffering from severe acute malnutrition, the deadliest form with short and long-term impacts.\nMeanwhile, approximately 98% of the cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible, decimating the agriculture sector and local food production, the UN added.\nNine out of ten persons have been displaced from their homes, it added. Cash is critically scarce and aid operations remain severely disrupted.\nFood prices are extremely high, and there is not enough fuel and water to cook, medicines and medical supplies, the UN statement said.\nGaza’s health system has severely deteriorated, access to safe drinking water and sanitation services have been drastically reduced, while multi-drug resistant infections are surging and levels of morbidity are alarmingly high among children, it added.\nThe statement said: “An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to allow unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response that can save lives.”\nAntónio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, described the famine as a “man-made disaster”, adding that an “an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, and full, unfettered humanitarian access” was required.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine’,” he said in a statement. “This is not a mystery – it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\nHe said that a famine was not only about food but the “deliberate collapse” of the systems needed for human survival. “People are starving,” Guterres said. “Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing.”\nThe secretary-general added: “As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher described the famine as “entirely preventable”, blaming it on “systematic obstruction by Israel” that has blocked food from reaching Gaza, AFP reported.\nIsrael’s foreign ministry rejected the UN’s findings, saying “there is no famine in Gaza”.\nIsrael and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks since July 6. Earlier efforts to reinstate a brief ceasefire that took effect in January had stalled due to major disagreements between the two sides.\nAlso read: Starvation in Gaza: How Israel is attempting to hide the truth of its brutal war"

      "text": "An international hunger monitoring group says portions of Gaza now meet its standards for declaring a famine, crossing a threshold that it said had not previously been reached.\nThe declaration on Friday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system adds to a contested field of claims about hunger in Gaza, with pro-Palestinian voices warning for nearly the entire length of the Israel-Hamas war beginning in October 2023 that mass starvation was imminent and Israel and its defenders contending that sufficient aid has entered Gaza to sustain civilians, despite temporary blockades and rocky distribution efforts.\nThe IPC report says a recent increase in aid, which followed a widespread outcry about hunger in Gaza, is not enough to stem the crisis.\n“The complete halt of humanitarian and commercial food deliveries in March and April, followed by critically low volumes through July, coupled with the collapse of local food production has led to extreme food shortages,” the group said in its report. “While 55,600 metric tonnes of food entered Gaza in the first half of August, this remains largely insufficient to offset the prolonged deficits.”\nIsrael quickly rejected the determination. “If famine = falling prices + 300 daily aid trucks + open aid routes Gaza must be the first famine in history marked by abundance,” tweeted the Israeli office responsible for aid in Gaza, called Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories or COGAT. It alleged that the IPC had lowered its standards for declaring famine in order to smear Israel.\nThe IPC is a tool used by a consortium of food insecurity experts who monitor conditions around the world and advise the United Nations and other entities about what they learn. The report says the group’s conclusions about what is happening in Gaza were constrained by limited access and information about some portions of the enclave, home to about 2 million Palestinians.\nIts declaration applies to a region that includes Gaza City, which the Israeli army is preparing to enter. The group said other portions of Gaza still face widespread hunger challenges and are projected to enter famine conditions by the end of September.\nSome skeptics of claims about hunger in Gaza had cited the lack of an official declaration of famine as evidence that conditions were not as extreme as some claimed, and as viral photographs of emaciated children and lines at aid stations would seem to suggest.\nThe price of food staples in Gaza skyrocketed in recent months, offering evidence of scarcity, and President Donald Trump said he believed there was “real starvation” in the enclave, pressing Israeli officials to send more aid. Israel says the number of aid trucks entering Gaza has risen steadily.\nThis week, celebrity chef Jose Andres visited Israel and Gaza, where his World Central Kitchen nonprofit has distributed food for most of the war. He expressed sympathy for sympathy on both sides of the conflict — and clarity about conditions in Gaza.\n“There is hunger in Gaza,” Andres told the Times of Israel. “I don’t know how much, but there is hunger in Gaza. And we need to make sure there’s no hunger in Gaza.”\nJTA has documented Jewish history in real-time for over a century.

However, the UN and Palestinians in Gaza say that what aid is entering is far below what is needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report on Friday, calling it “false and biased”.\nThe agency, known as COGAT, rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nIn a post on social media, Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs also rejected the findings, saying the IPC report was “based on Hamas lies”.\nIt said that more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks with staple foods.\n“A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nIsrael’s plan to escalate the war in Gaza City weeks after a warning that famine was beginning there demonstrates how “intentional the famine is and how Israel wields starvation”, he said.\nMr Netanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel’s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether."

      "text": "Israel Rejects Claim by UN on Alleged Famine in Gaza\nJerusalem says the report is calculated to produce a ‘false accusation’ against the Jewish state.\nThe United Nations declaration, for the first time, that famine conditions exist in Gaza complicates Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to end the war, while it helps Hamas to add demands in diplomatic negotiations.\nIsrael is rejecting a report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, known as IPC, according to which level-five famine, the highest level of food scarcity, exists in Gaza “with reasonable evidence.”\nThe IPC “has just published a ‘tailor-made’ fabricated report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign,” the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement posted on X. “Unbelievably, the IPC twisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria just to produce false accusations against Israel.”\nAccording to the Israel Defense Forces, most of the data the report relied on are from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. The IPC, according to officials, changed its own criterion to fit the report, even as up to 100,000 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the start of the war. An additional recent “flood” of aid caused a sharp decline in food staple prices in the Strip, easing hunger there, they say.\n“The laws of supply and demand don’t lie — the IPC does,” according to the Israeli foreign ministry. While Jerusalem rejects the report, Israel’s detractors seize on it as proof that the war in Gaza must end. It is published just as the IDF is making final preparations to enter Hamas’s most significant remaining stronghold at Gaza City.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine,’” the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. The Gaza famine, he adds, is “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.” He urged “an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, and full, unfettered humanitarian access,” and said the time to take those steps is “not tomorrow, it is now.”\nOn Thursday Mr. Netanyahu visited the IDF’s Gaza Division that is amassing troops outside of the strip. Entering Gaza City, he said, represents the war’s “decisive stage.”\nThe IDF is already acting, from the air and on the ground, in the southern and northeastern edges of Gaza City. The plan, approved Friday by the defense minister, Israel Katz, envisions the evacuation of non-combatants among the city’s 900,000 residents to the Strip’s southern area, before a final assault on Hamas fighters left behind.\nThe civilians would be relocated to a tent city in southern Gaza, where they would be supplied with life necessities. IDF officials have alerted Gaza City hospitals and other institutions of the plan, urging them to prepare to move medical equipment and patients to the south.\nEven as those plans seem to get well on the way, Mr. Netanyahu said he has instructed his team “to begin immediate negotiations for the release of all our hostages and the end of the war, on conditions that are acceptable for Israel.” As of yet, no venue to such negotiations has been determined.\nFor days the premier’s office has indicated that the military takeover of Gaza City might be suspended if negotiations on releasing all hostages conclude to Israel’s satisfaction. “Those two things, the defeat of Hamas and the release of all our hostages, go hand in hand,” Mr. Netanyahu said Thursday.\nJerusalem officials claim that the mere threat of a Gaza City takeover has already moved Hamas to accept a deal that it has rejected two months ago. Washington officials have blamed Hamas for the deadlock in negotiations.\n“The problem has always been that just when we think that things are ready to be resolved, Hamas changes the terms, they put new demands on the table, most of which become utterly unacceptable, and it all falls apart,” the American ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, told Israel’s Arabic-language station Makan 33 on Friday.\nHamas previously rejected a proposal made by President Trump’s special envoy, Steven Witkoff, which Israel accepted. It envisioned a two-month cease-fire, an increase in aid to Gaza, and the release of hundreds of terrorists in Israeli prisons in return for 10, or half, of the living Israeli hostages, and nearly 20 bodies of dead hostages.\nThis week, Hamas officials announced that they now accept an Egyptian proposal, which made mere cosmetic changes to the original Witkoff plan. Mr. Netanayhu, though, is yet to agree, and he now demands a new agreement, in which Hamas would release all remaining 50 hostages, dead and alive, and disarm.\nMr. Netanyahu might rely on his confidence that pressure and the fear of losing its control over Gaza City would force Hamas to release the hostages. The IPC famine report is now bound to increase global pressure on Israel, and to stiffen Hamas’s negotiation stance."

Another 1.07 million people (54 percent) are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), and 396,000people (20 percent) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\"Between mid-August and the end of September 2025, conditions are expected to further worsen with Famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while those in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely rise to 1.14 million (58 percent).\"\nIt added: \"Acute malnutrition is projected to continue worsening rapidly. Through June 2026, at least132,000 children under five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition—double the IPC estimates from May 2025. This includes over 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death. Nearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require urgent nutrition response.\"\nMeanwhile, it explained: \"Conditions in North Gaza Governorate are estimated to be as severe—or worse—than in Gaza Governorate. However, limited data prevents IPC classification of this area, highlighting the urgent need for access and comprehensive assessments.\"\nThe IPC defines famine as being “a situation in which at least one in five households has an extreme lack of food and face starvation and destitution, resulting in extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death”. The Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the IPC's report, calling it \"false and biased\". The agency, known as COGAT, rejected there was famine in Gaza, saying significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, labelling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.\nBut Taahra Ghazi, co-CEO of ActionAid UK, said: “That famine should be officially confirmed in Gaza for the first time by the IPC despite months of repeated warnings, and despite it being entirely preventable, is a deep stain on our collective humanity. Let there be no doubt: this is an entirely engineered famine and the direct result of the Israeli authorities’ deliberate blocking of food, water and other humanitarian aid into Gaza, which breaches international humanitarian law.\n\"It is utterly shameful that, for so many months, the Israeli authorities have used starvation as a weapon of war with impunity: now we are seeing the calamitous consequences play out. Malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed their babies; our own staff and partners are dizzy and exhausted because they give any food they can find to their children and go hungry themselves.”\nIt comes as Israel’s defence minister has warned Gaza City could be destroyed unless Hamas accepts its terms, with the country preparing for an expanded offensive in the area. After Netanyahu said he would authorise the military to seize Gaza City, Israel Katz warned the enclave's largest city could \"turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun\" - areas reduced to rubble earlier in the war.\nMr Katz wrote on X: \"The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas' murderers and rapists in Gaza - until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war.\" He restated Israel's ceasefire demands to release all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament. Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.\nGhazi added: “People in Gaza City are already experiencing famine: now they are in the midst of an intensified assault by the Israeli military and facing a full ground offensive, which would forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of people and severely disrupt humanitarian operations at a time when they are needed more than ever. It is difficult to stress just how much more dire the situation will become if it goes ahead.\n\"There is now a race against time to stop this famine from becoming any further entrenched. Every hour counts and there is no time to waste. The international community must take meaningful action and use diplomatic pressure to bring about a permanent ceasefire immediately. Food and other aid must be allowed to enter Gaza unhindered, rapidly and at scale if there is to be any hope of preventing any more deaths by starvation.”\nFaten, Senior Project Officer with WEFAQ, ActionAid’s partner in Gaza, said: “In the past two months, I have lost 20 kilograms. My children have lost weight and are malnourished. We haven’t had proper meals for three days. I am exhausted, dizzy, and terrified my children will get sicker. I cry daily. This is the first time in my life I have wished I didn’t have children – because watching them waste away is unbearable.”\nMeanwhile, Dr Ra’ed Al-Baba, who works at Al Awda Hospital, run by ActionAid’s partner Al-Awda, said: “There are mothers who resort to using legume water, herbs, and other alternatives to infant milk because of the severe shortage. These methods carry catastrophic risks, causing gastroenteritis, food poisoning, delayed growth, severe anaemia, and even the inability to move. We have seen cases of extreme dehydration from polluted water mixed with these substitutes. This is not survival, this is slow death.”\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news from the Irish Mirror direct to your inbox: Sign up here."

      "text": "The world’s leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip’s largest city is gripped by famine, and that it’s likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nThe IPC determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel’s restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing high levels of starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nIsrael rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.”\nAt Gaza’s Nasser Hospital, doctors treat malnourished children daily\nIsrael’s defence minister says Gaza City could be destroyed unless Hamas agrees to demands\nThe grim milestone – the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East – is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been in a brutal war with Hamas since the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to escalate the war soon by seizing Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, which experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said. Last month, the IPC said the “worst-case scenario of famine” was unfolding in Gaza, but stopped short of an official determination.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the findings show a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself” and appealed for an “immediate ceasefire.”\nNetanyahu denies there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas. “The IPC report is an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation. Israel has a policy of preventing starvation,” his office posted on X.\nThe U.S. State Department also sought to cast doubt on the report. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “is a serious concern,” but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid.\nAfter the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the UN and Palestinians in Gaza say what’s entering is far below what’s needed.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\nThe Associated Press\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report, calling it “false and biased.” The agency, known as COGAT, said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. But experts say Gaza is still reeling from the tightening of the blockade from early March until mid-May, when Israel barred the import of all food, medicine and other goods.\n“A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel’s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\nFamilies in Gaza forced to drink contaminated water as crisis grows\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan’s western Darfur region last year.\nThe IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\nAt least 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30 per cent of children six months to five years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15 per cent of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under five, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza’s population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\nThe UN Human Rights Office warned 'the risk of starvation is everywhere in Gaza' as scenes of desperation played out in Khan Younis following an aid drop.\nThe Associated Press\nAlex de Waal, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n“It seems that it’s necessary for experts to shout ‘famine!’ before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,” he said. he said.\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there’s currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\nThe traditional, UN-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\nWitnesses, health officials and the UN rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington.\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighbourhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City’s Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no pre-existing conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Thousands will be too weak to evacuate the city ahead of the planned offensive, said Blacka.\nFamilies in Gaza City say they’re watching their loved ones waste away.\nYousef Sbeteh’s two teenage children were injured by shrapnel during an Israeli air strike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they’ve both lost weight because there hasn’t been enough food, he said, adding that he can’t afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no pre-existing conditions.\nHis 15-year-old daughter Aya lost nearly 20 kilograms, or about 30 per cent of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms. The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n“Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,” Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. “But I can’t provide that now.”"

      "text": "The United Nations on Friday (August 22, 2025) officially declared a famine in Gaza, the first in West Asia, with its experts saying 500,000 people were facing “catastrophic” hunger.\nU.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to the Palestinian territory “because of systematic obstruction by Israel”.\nBut Israel’s Foreign Ministry immediately hit back, saying “there is no famine in Gaza”.\nIn a statement, it slammed the report by the Rome-based IPC panel, saying it was “based on Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”.\nU.N. agencies have for months been warning of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory.\nIn its latest updated on Friday, the IPC said “as of 15 August 2025, famine (IPC Phase 5) — with reasonable evidence — is confirmed in Gaza Governorate”, Gaza City, which covers about 20 percent of the Gaza Strip.\nFamine is projected to expand to Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, which would cover around two-thirds of the Palestinian territory.\n“After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,” the report said.\nThis number, based on information gathered between July 1 and August 15, is expected to increase to nearly 641,000 people -- nearly a third of the population -- by the end of September.\n‘Haunt us all’\nThe IPC said this was the most severe deterioration in the situation since it began analysing hunger in the Gaza Strip.\nIt said the change was driven by a sharp escalation in the war between Israel and Hamas, and the resulting massive displacement of people, combined with the severe restriction of access to humanitarian and commercial supplies of food.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel.\nSpeaking in Geneva, the U.N.’s Fletcher said the famine should “haunt us all”.\n“It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” he told reporters.\nThe IPC noted the local food system has also collapsed, with an estimated 98 percent of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, livestock decimated and fishing banned.\nTo add to this, the health system has severely deteriorated, while access to safe drinking water and adequate hygiene has been drastically reduced.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) is a coalition of monitors tasked by the UN to warn of impending crises.\nIts definition of a famine has three elements.\nFirstly, at least 20% of households — one in five — must have an extreme lack of food.\nSecond, at least 30% — one in three — children under five are acutely malnourished.\nAnd third, at least two in every 10,000 people are dying every day because of outright starvation or because of malnutrition and disease.\nHamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nIsrael’s offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.\nPublished - August 22, 2025 03:45 pm IST"

      "text": "Famine has struck Gaza, will likely spread, says global hunger monitor\nUNITED NATIONS, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Famine has struck an area of Gaza and will likely spread over the next month, a global hunger monitor determined on Friday, an assessment that will escalate pressure on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the war-torn Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people - nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza - are experiencing famine and that was due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City - known as Gaza governorate - which the IPC said was in famine, its first such determination in the enclave. The rest are in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis - central and southern areas that the IPC projected would be in famine by the end of next month.\nIsrael dismissed the report as \"false and biased\", with the military body that coordinates aid deliveries into Gaza saying the IPC had based its survey on \"partial data originating from the Hamas Terrorist Organisation\".\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached \"unimaginable levels\" after nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has long warned of an \"epic humanitarian catastrophe\" in the enclave of more than 2 million people.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation.\nISRAEL CONTROLS GAZA ACCESS\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said on Friday the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and overlooked a recent increase in food supplies taken into the territory.\n\"COGAT firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City,\" the agency said, denouncing the report as \"unprofessional\".\nThe U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC - an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organizations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65% of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of U.S. public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict.\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Don Durfee, Stephen Coates and Crispian Balmer, Editing by William Maclean)"

      "text": "Updated 5.40pm\nThe United Nations on Friday officially declared a famine in Gaza, the first time it has done so in the Middle East, with experts warning 500,000 people face \"catastrophic\" hunger.\n\"It is a famine: the Gaza famine,\" said Tom Fletcher, the UN's emergency relief coordinator.\nHe blamed Israel, accusing it of \"systematic obstruction\" of aid deliveries to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.\nIsrael's foreign ministry said the declaration that famine is now present in and around Gaza City was \"based on Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests\".\n\"There is no famine in Gaza,\" it insisted.\nThe assessment of famine was made by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC), a coalition of monitors tasked by the UN to warn of impending crises.\nIt defines famine as occurring when 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food; 30 per cent of children under five are acutely malnourished; and at least two in every 10,000 people die daily from outright starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\nUN agencies have for months been warning of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has worsened as Israel steps up its offensive against Hamas.\nThe Rome-based IPC said that \"as of 15 August 2025, famine (IPC Phase 5) -- with reasonable evidence -- is confirmed in Gaza governorate\", the area that encompasses Gaza City and its surroundings.\nThe UN estimates that nearly one million people currently live in the Gaza governorate.\n\"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,\" the IPC report said.\nIt projected that famine would spread to the Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, potentially encompassing nearly 641,000 people.\nThe IPC said it was \"the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region\".\nA famine was projected in Yemen in 2018 but never officially materialised, despite the humanitarian crisis in the country, a spokesman told AFP.\n'Haunt us all'\nThe IPC said the famine in Gaza was \"entirely man-made\", driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should \"haunt us all\".\n\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" he said.\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war, the release of all hostages taken by Hamas from Israel, and full humanitarian access to Gaza.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,\" he said.\nThe International Red Cross described the declaration of famine as \"devastating and entirely foreseeable\".\n\"Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met,\" it said in a statement.\n'Too weak to cry'\nChildren are particularly hard hit by the lack of food.\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished -- a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.\n\"The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,\" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.\nThe local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98 percent of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said. Livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.\nThe severe deterioration of the health system and the lack of safe drinking water and adequate hygiene compound the crisis.\nGathering information is extremely difficult in Gaza.\nThe IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.\nIsrael's foreign ministry rejected the IPC's assessment as \"political\" and asserted that a \"massive influx of aid\" had entered the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.\nThe Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, COGAT, accused the authors of relying on \"partial data\" and ignoring information provided to them."

      "text": "Famine has officially struck Gaza: Global hunger monitor\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the Gaza famine is a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\".\nUNITED NATIONS: Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine, and it will likely spread, a global hunger monitor determined on Friday (Aug 22), an assessment that will escalate pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system said 514,000 people - nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza - are experiencing famine, with the number due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City - known as Gaza governorate - which the IPC said was in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but said limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael dismissed the report as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\n\"There is no famine in Gaza,\" the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine, at least 20 per cent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the Gaza famine was a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\".\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\n\"People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing ... We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.\"\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached \"unimaginable levels\".\nUS President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with some in his Republican party, who have staunchly supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation and blamed Hamas for creating food shortages.\nISRAEL CONTROLS GAZA ACCESS\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n\"The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas' propaganda campaign,\" the agency said.\nThe UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the UN-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC - an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organisations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65 per cent of Americans believe the US should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the US, its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of US public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on Oct 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict."

Another 1.07 million people – 54 percent of the population – are facing emergency (IPC Phase 4), and 396,000 people (20 percent) are in crisis (IPC Phase 3).\nConditions are expected to further worsen between mid-August and the end of September 2025, with famine projected to expand to the central Deir el-Balah and southern Khan Younis areas.\nBy the end of this period, almost a third of the population of Gaza – nearly 641,000 people – is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while the number of people in emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely increase to 1.14 million, or some 58 percent of the population.\nThis marks the most severe deterioration since the IPC partnership – which comprises 21 organisations including UN agencies, NGOs, technical agencies and regional bodies – began analysing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the Gaza Strip.\nIt also marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in Gaza.\nThe IPC global initiative described the situation as “a race against time”, adding that “famine must be stopped at all costs”.\nIt warned that acute malnutrition was projected to continue worsening “rapidly”.\nAt least 132,000 children under the age of five will be at risk of death from acute malnutrition by June 2026, it said. This number has doubled compared with the IPC estimates reported in May 2025.\nThis includes at least 41,000 severe cases at heightened risk of death.\nNearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require an urgent nutrition response, the IPC initiative added.\n‘Man-made disaster’\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Gaza’s famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\n“Famine is not only about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,” Guterres said. “People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing.”\nThe UN chief said Israel, as the occupying power, has “unequivocal obligations” under international law, including the duty to unsure that food and medical supplies are made available to the population of Gaza.\n“We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,” he said. “No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow – it is now.”\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said Gaza’s famine was taking place “within a few hundred metres of food,” as aid trucks remain stuck at land crossings amid Israeli restrictions on commercial and humanitarian deliveries.\n“It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war,” Fletcher told a press conference.\nIn a plea to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Fletcher demanded that Israel “end the retribution” and open Gaza’s crossings for unrestricted access.\n“Let us get food and other supplies in and at the massive scale required,” he said. “For humanity’s sake, let us in.”\nDirector-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said “this man-made, widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases like diarrhoea are becoming fatal, especially for children.”\n“Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines,” he said on X, and called for an end to “aid blockages.”\n‘No famine’ in Gaza\nIsrael does not accept that there is widespread malnutrition among Palestinians in Gaza and disputes the hunger fatality figures, arguing that the deaths are due to other medical causes.\nResponding to the IPC report, Israel’s foreign ministry said there was “no famine in Gaza”.\n“Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets,” the ministry said in a statement.\nPalestinian group Hamas said Israel’s “criminal denial of this documented fact, and its false claims that there is no famine in Gaza, reveal a criminal mentality that deliberately lies to cover up the murder by starvation practiced against children, women, and the sick, in flagrant defiance of all international laws and norms.”\nIt added that the international community “bears an urgent legal and moral responsibility to stop crimes against humanity and save more than two million people facing genocide, starvation, and the systematic destruction of all necessities of life”.\nAhead of the report’s release, the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, preemptively attacked its findings. “You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilised Hamas savages,” he wrote on X.\n“Maybe the over fed terrorists could share some of their warehouse full they stole with hungry people especially the hostages”.\nIsrael has been insisting that Hamas is starving the remaining Israeli captives in Gaza, some of whom appeared emaciated in recent footage released by the Palestinian group.\nIsrael imposed a total blockade on Gaza in March and has severely restricted aid entering the territory since May, routing supplies via the controversial Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) scheme.\nAccording to the UN, more than 1,300 people seeking food supplies have been killed since late May, including 859 at GHF aid distribution sites, which are under the control of the Israeli military and private US contractors.\nStarvation used as a ‘weapon of war’\nSeveral NGOs reacted to the IPC report echoing the UN’s warnings of deliberate starvation.\nThe UK-based Oxfam said the famine in Gaza was “entirely driven by Israel’s near-total blockade on food and vital aid, the horrifying consequence of Israel’s violence, and its use of starvation as a weapon of war.”\n“This is what our staff and partners have been witnessing for months – people in the Gaza Strip being deliberately starved, relentlessly bombarded and forcefully displaced,” Oxfam’s Helen Stawski said in a statement.\nSave the Children said Gaza was being “systematically starved by design, and children are paying the highest price.”\n“This engineered famine is the ultimate and inevitable result of the Government of Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon of war,” the organisation said. “The sustained siege on food, medicine and fuel was bound to lead to this preventable catastrophe. There is no world leader who did not know this was coming, who hasn’t been warned again and again.”\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) said it was “appalled” by the IPC report, which “confirms the unthinkable.”\n“Famine is now a deadly reality in Gaza City,” it said in a statement. “This devastating milestone confirms what humanitarians have warned for months: famine is no longer a looming threat—it is a deadly reality with catastrophic hunger tightening its grip across the population.”\n“This is not a natural disaster, it is a man-made catastrophe, unfolding in full view of the world and entirely preventable,” it added."

It applied the classification to an area home to 514,000 displaced Palestinians - nearly quarter of Gaza's population.\nWhile the body has previously warned that famine was imminent across Gaza, it had stopped short of making a formal declaration.\nThe IPC is the globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity.\nIt is an initiative involving 21 aid organisations, as well as several United Nations agencies.

That includes at least 112 children.\nThe IPC said that through to June 2026, at least 132,000 children under five were expected to suffer from acute malnutrition - double the estimate from May this year.

      "text": "Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The top global hunger monitoring agency Friday declared a famine affecting more than half a million people in a part of Gaza that includes Gaza City as Israeli forces laid siege to the city in an effort to pressure Hamas ahead of negotiations to release hostages in exchange for a cease-fire.\nFamine had been confirmed with the number of people affected a little under 514,000, out of a total population of 2 million, with that number forecast to rise to 641,000 by the end of September, according to a report by the Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nPeople affected were facing \"starvation, destitution and death.\"\nThe IPC's definition of famine is when at least 20% of households in a defined area are facing an extreme lack of food, acute malnutrition affects at least 30% of children and the daily death toll from starvation reaches a minimum threshold of two adults, or four children, per 10,000 head of population.\nHowever, the IPC said that, due to a lack of data, it had to use an alternate measure to arrive at its conclusion, which is met when 15% of children were suffering from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their mid-upper arm, together with other underlying evidence.\nThe IPC said it also projected conditions it described as \"catastrophic\" would spread southwards to the Deir al Balah and Khan Younis areas during the same timeframe if the humanitarian situation did not improve.\n\"Famine is a race against time. An immediate cease-fire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives,\" it added.\nIsrael denied there was a famine in Gaza and accused the IPC of faking the report, altering its methodology to suit its anti-Israel bias.\nFriday's announcement was only the fourth time the organization, which is backed by the United Nations and 19 other intergovernmental bodies and NGOs, had declared famine in its more than two-decade-long history.\nHumanitarian groups and global health agencies, including the United Nations, World Food Program and World Health Organization, said they had been expecting the news.\n\"Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: 'famine'. This is not a mystery -- it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\"Famine is not only about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival. People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing,\" he said.\nGuterres said international law was absolutely clear on Israel's obligation to ensure food and medical supplies for the population.\n\"A cease-fire is an absolute and moral imperative now. The world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nBut U.S. and Israeli officials condemned the report, with the foreign ministry in Jerusalem alleging it was a \"fabricated report to Hamas' fake campaign,\" while Mike Huckabee, the United States' Ambassador to Israel, drew attention to the starvation being endured by Israeli hostages.\n\"Maybe the overfed terrorists could share some of their warehouse full they stole with hungry people, especially the hostages,\" he said.\nHowever, the World Peace Foundation told the BBC that the method to determine famine that the IPC used was accepted standard practice and was not a \"lowered or new threshold.\"\n\"Israel won't permit humanitarian data collection and then complains about the quality of the data,\" said WPF executive director Alex de Waal."

An immediate ceasefire is needed, and at the same time, Hamas must release the hostages immediately and unconditionally,\" Alabali Radovan added.\nUN human rights chief says starving Gaza could amount to 'war crime'\nVolker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the famine declared by a UN-backed body in parts of northern Gaza is a \"direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government.\"\nHe added that \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare.\"\nTürk's statement to reporters came after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said it had \"reasonable evidence\" that a famine is occurring.\nA formal declaration of famine by the IPC meets three criteria: at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to \"outright starvation.\"\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was preventable if the UN had not been barred from delivering food aid.\n\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" Fletcher said.\nIsrael has denied the IPC assessment of famine, saying the report was based on \"methodological flaws\" and \"unreliable sources.\"\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday described conditions in the Gaza Strip as a \"man-made disaster,\" adding that Israel was obliged under international law to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,\" he added.\nIsrael rejects IPC report on Gaza famine\nIsrael on Friday rejected a UN-backed report by a global hunger monitor declaring that a famine is currently occurring in Gaza City.\nAn Israeli Foreign Ministry statement said there was no famine in Gaza, and that the food security report was \"based on Hamas lies laundered through organizations with vested interests.\"\nThe world's foremost authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said earlier Friday that it has \"reasonable evidence\" that famine has been occurring in Gaza Governorate, an administrative region, which includes Gaza City, since August 15.\nIt is the first time the IPC has declared a famine in the Middle East.\nCOGAT, the Israeli authority that coordinates civil affairs regarding Palestinians, also rejected the IPC findings, accusing Hamas of carrying out a \"false starvation campaign.\"\n\"COGAT firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City. Previous reports and assessments by the IPC have repeatedly been proven inaccurate and do not reflect the reality on the ground,\" it said.\nIsrael has previously announced measures to allow more aid into Gaza. Humanitarian organizations have warned for months that the level of food aid is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of the population.\nIsrael says Gaza City will be destroyed if Hamas doesn't disarm\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned on Friday that Gaza City would be completely destroyed if Hamas does not agree on Israel's conditions for ending the war, which include the release of all hostages and complete disarmament.\n\"Soon, the gates of hell will open upon the heads of Hamas's murderers and rapists in Gaza — until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war,\" Katz posted on X after operational plans for military action in Gaza City were approved.\nKatz added that if Hamas militants did not agree to the terms, Gaza City would end up like the cities of Rafah and Beit Hanoun, which have been largely razed by Israeli bombing since the start of the war in October 2023. Hamas has rejected disarming as part of a ceasefire deal.\nGaza City is one of the last places in the entire Palestinian enclave that still has basic operating infrastructure.\nIsrael's plans to take over Gaza City have been widely condemned as exacerbating an ongoing humanitarian crisis among Palestinians in the territory, while potentially endangering the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas militants.\nKatz said the plans include relocating Gaza City's residents, which number around 1 million plus hundreds of thousands of people displaced from other parts of Gaza.\nHumanitarian organizations have said another mass displacement of Palestinians is unfeasible, since other areas of the enclave have been largely destroyed and there are not enough operational medical facilities outside of Gaza City.\nThe operational plans for the Gaza City offensive were approved Thursday after a meeting of the Israeli Security Council.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Hamas militants are continuing to organize attacks from Gaza City, and the military mission is to destroy the militant's stronghold while pushing to rescue the remaining hostages, of which around 20 are believed to still be alive.\nStarvation, destitution and death grip Gaza, UN-backed assessment says\nParts of Gaza are now experiencing famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and death, according to the latest report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\nMore than half a million people are facing the most severe, or \"catastrophic,\" levels of food insecurity, the UN-backed assessment found.\nThis is the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the territory.\nA further one million people, more than half the population, are in an emergency situation, while nearly 400,000 are in crisis, the report said.\nIn order to declare a famine, the IPC has three criteria, at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to \"outright starvation.\"\nConditions are expected to worsen between mid-August and the end of September, with famine projected to spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.\nAfter a global outcry at Israel's severe restrictions on aid from March, the Israeli military began allowing a limited amount of food into Gaza in late July.\nThe findings come as Israel has renewed military operations in Gaza City.\nWelcome to our coverage\nOn Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a plan to capture Gaza City and floated the idea of fresh ceasefire negotiations with Hamas.\nOn Friday morning, his defense minister threatened to open \"the gates of hell\" if the militant group doesn't agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war in Gaza.\nMeanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the world's leading hunger monitor, has officially declared a famine in parts of Gaza.\nWe'll be covering reactions to all of this, along with other developments from across the Middle East, right here in this blog."

      "text": "Famine determined in parts of Gaza, 500,000 experiencing 'catastrophic' hunger: Report\nFamine is projected to expand to central and southern Gaza by end of September.\nFamine has been determined in Gaza Governorate, where Gaza City is located, according to a warning issued Friday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\nThe report from IPC -- a global initiative monitoring hunger with the backing of governments, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations -- projected famine would expand to Deir al-Balah Governorate, in central Gaza, and Khan Younis Governorate, in southern Gaza, by the end of September.\nThe IPC itself doesn't issue official declarations of famine, but its findings can inform governments and bodies such as the U.N. to make a famine declaration.\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, said in a statement Friday it \"firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City,\" alleging that the IPC report \"is based on partial and unreliable sources, many of them affiliated with Hamas.\"\nThe report also found that more than half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing Phase 5 conditions, which are characterized as catastrophic levels of food insecurity. About 1.07 million people, 54% of the population, are facing Phase 4 conditions, characterized as emergency levels of food insecurity.\nBetween mid-August and the end of September 2025, almost a third of the population -- nearly 641,000 people -- are expected to face Phase 5 catastrophic conditions and the number of people facing emergency levels will likely increase to 1.14 million, according to the report.\nThe IPC report stated that, given the inability to classify North Gaza due to barriers reaching the area, the figures in the report are an underestimate. Estimates also exclude any remaining population in Rafah, in southern Gaza, because it is mostly uninhabited, according to the IPC.\nIn a statement on Friday, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office called the IPC's declaration of famine in parts of Gaza \"an outright lie\" and \"a modern blood libel.\"\n\"Israel, will continue to act responsibly, ensuring aid reaches Gaza's civilians while destroying Hamas's terror machine,\" the statement read, in part.\nThe food crisis in Gaza has worsened since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended in March and Israel instituted a blockade on aid into Gaza. An increasing number of deaths attributed to malnutrition have also been reported and gut-wrenching images have emerged of suffering children and long food lines.\nIsraeli said the 11-week blockade, from mid-March to late May of this year, was instituted to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken during Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023,\nIn mid May, multiple doctors and international aid workers told ABC News that water, food, medicine and medical supplies were running low, and in some cases running out completely.\nThis led to the creation of the Israeli- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which set up designated aid distribution sites rather than delivering aid throughout the strip. Palestinians and aid organizations reported incidents of people being shot at while trying to retrieve aid as well as general chaos at the sites, which continues to be an ongoing issue.\nAmid ongoing international pressure, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began coordinating aid air drops in Gaza with countries including Jordan. Humanitarian organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, have said airdrops are \"ineffective and dangerous.\"\nThe report also found that, through June 2026, at least 132,000 children under age 5 are at risk of death from acute malnutrition, about double the IPC estimates reported in May 2025.\nThe IPC added that this is the first time a famine has officially been confirmed in the Middle East.\nTo determine if a famine is happening, according to IPC, three thresholds have to be met: 20% of households must be facing an extreme food shortage, 30% of children must be acutely malnourished and either two adults or four children must be dying every day per 10,000 people.\nDuring a press briefing in Geneva on Friday, U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine determination should be \"a moment of collective shame.\"\n\"Everyone owns this, the Gaza famine is the world's famine. It is a famine that asks, 'But what did you do?' A famine that will and must haunt us all,\" Fletcher told reporters. \"We all have to look back as the international community and think where could we have got this in a different place. And we've watched it happen in real time.\"\nIn a statement, Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps, an aid organization that provides humanitarian services in Gaza, said the confirmation of famine is \"absolutely horrifying yet not surprising\" and a situation that was \"entirely preventable.\"\nD'Oyen McKenna said Mercy Corps has aid, including food kits, hygiene supplies and shelter material at the Gaza border waiting for permission to enter -- enough to help 160,000 people -- but claims it has been blocked for months.\nShe said that, as a result, 2,700 of Mercy Corps' food kits have items that have already expired.\n\"There is still time to save lives, but only if Israeli authorities enable humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded and at the scale needed; if aid workers have the safety guarantees to move freely and reach civilians in urgent need of help; if electricity and water systems are fully restored and sustained; and if health and nutrition services can function,\" D'Oyen McKenna's statement read, in part. \"What we are witnessing in Gaza is a moral failing of the highest order. The world knows how to stop a famine -- we just need the will to act.\"\nIsraeli officials have said there are hundreds of truckloads of aid sitting at the border for the U.N. to distribute. In late July, ABC News' Ian Pannell visited an aid station in Gaza that had stacks of undelivered food. An IDF spokesperson said it was the international community's responsibility to deliver it, but the U.N. said it can't deliver the aid safely.\nA spokesperson for COGAT said Saturday in response to claims from Mercy Corps and other organizations about aid being held up that the \"reality is entirely the opposite of the claims that were published.\"\nThe spokesperson said, \"Israel acts to allow and facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, while the terrorist organization Hamas seeks to exploit the aid to strengthen its military capabilities and consolidate its control over the population. This is sometimes done under the cover of certain international aid organizations, whether knowingly or unknowingly.\"\nIn late July, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the idea that Israel is applying a campaign of starvation in Gaza is \"a bold-faced lie,\" adding that \"there is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.\"\nIsraeli officials have long accused Hamas of stealing aid meant for civilians, which Hamas denies.\nA USAID analysis appeared to undercut some of the assertions about the extent to which Hamas had allegedly stolen humanitarian aid. A presentation reviewed by ABC News, examining more than 150 reported incidents involving the theft or loss of U.S.-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza, showed that the group failed to find any evidence that Hamas engaged in widespread diversion of aid to cause the amount of hunger seen in the strip.\nUSAID officials say their findings indicate that in the majority of cases involving the loss of aid, the perpetrator could not be definitively identified."

      "text": "The world's leading authority on food crises says the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it is likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, today said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nThe IPC determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel's restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing high levels of starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nThe grim milestone — the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East — is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been in a brutal war with Hamas since the militant group's October 7, 2023, attack.\nIsrael says it plans to soon escalate the war by seizing Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, which experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said.\nLast month, the IPC said the \"worst-case scenario of famine\" was unfolding in Gaza, but stopped short of an official determination.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.\nAfter the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the UN and Palestinians in Gaza say what's entering is far below what's needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report Friday, calling it \"false and biased\". The agency, known as COGAT, rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\n\"A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,\" said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nIsrael's plan to escalate the war in Gaza City weeks after a warning that famine was beginning there demonstrates how \"intentional the famine is and how Israel wields starvation\", he said.\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel's goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\nHow a famine is determined\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.\nThe IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\n- At least 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving.\n- At least 30 per cent of children six months to five years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height.\n- A least two people, or four children under five, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nIsrael's offensive and its restrictions on access to Gaza have made collecting data difficult.\nThe data analysed between July 1 and August 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza's population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\nAlex de Waal, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n\"Sadly, it seems that it's necessary for experts to shout 'famine!' before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,\" he said.\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.\nIsrael eased those restrictions in May and says there's currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. But it also pushed ahead with a new US-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\nThe traditional, UN-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\nWitnesses, health officials and the UN rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\nA parent in Gaza City watches his children waste away\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people.\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighbourhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhoea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished.\nIf Israel evacuates people from the city ahead of its new offensive, thousands will be too weak to leave, said Blacka.\n\"Because of the starvation it will put extra strain on already depleted bodies and will lead to the death of many of the Palestinians,\" she said.\nFamilies in Gaza City say they're watching their loved ones waste away.\nYousef Sbeteh's two teenage children were injured by shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they've both lost weight because there hasn't been enough food, he said, adding that he can't afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.\nHis 15-year-old daughter Aya lost nearly 20 kilograms, or about 30 per cent of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms. The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n\"Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,\" Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter.\n\"But I can't provide that now.\"\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

biased\".\nFamine has has been declared in an area of Gaza and will likely spread over the next month, a global hunger monitor has determined.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people — nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza — are experiencing famine and that was due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City — known as Gaza governorate — which the IPC said was in famine, its first such determination in the enclave.\nThe rest are in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis — central and southern areas that the IPC projected would be in famine by the end of next month.\nIsrael dismissed the report as \"false and biased\", with the military body that coordinates aid deliveries into Gaza saying the IPC had based its survey on \"partial data originating from the Hamas Terrorist Organisation\".\n\"In recent weeks, a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food price,\" Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\"This assessment too will be thrown into the despicable trash bin of political documents.\"\nVice President of the Palestinian Australian New Zealand Medical Association (PANZMA), Doctor Muntaser Musameh, told ABC's The World he believed the situation was worse in the north of Gaza, where the IPC was unable to access because it was too dangerous.\nHe said the total number of people starving was likely higher than the report found.\n\"There probably will be at least a million people who are in dire famine situation,\"Mr Musameh said.\n\"We need to act immediately … other parts of Gaza hasn't been able to declare that [famine] because of a lack of access to the evidence.\n\"We need our government to act now and to try to put pressure to allow all the medical aid and all the food to go in before the deaths spiral uncontrollably.\"\nUN chief says famine a direct result of Israeli government actions\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20 per cent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached \"unimaginable levels\" after nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has long warned of an \"epic humanitarian catastrophe\" in the enclave of more than 2 million people.\nUS President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation.\nIsrael controls Gaza access\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza.\nCOGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said on Friday the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and overlooked a recent increase in food supplies taken into the territory.\n\"COGAT firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City,\" the agency said, denouncing the report as \"unprofessional\".\nTess Ingram is in Gaza for UNICEF and told ABC's The World the report \"is our worst fears being realised\".\n\"I've been at nutrition clinics where UNICEF has been treating pregnant women and babies these last two days, and many of the parents I spoke to are at their absolute wit's end,\" Ms Ingram said.\n\"They have crying children in their arms who they are unable to feed, and they know that they need to get them food, but there is just nothing that they can do to help their kids survive.\"\nThe UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness.\nIsrael has been critical of the UN-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates.\nIt was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC.\nWires"

      "text": "The United Nations on Friday officially declared a famine in Gaza, the first in the Middle East, warning that over 500,000 residents are now facing “catastrophic” hunger.\nThe announcement underscores a spiraling humanitarian crisis intensified by more than 22 months of relentless conflict, blocked aid and collapsed local food systems.\nU.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher, speaking from Geneva, said the famine was entirely preventable. “Food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction,” Fletcher said. “It is a famine that should haunt us all.” Israel’s government immediately rejected the declaration, dismissing the report as “based on Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests,” and asserting that “there is no famine in Gaza.”\nThe Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a coalition of U.N.-backed monitors, confirmed that Gaza City – which houses roughly 20% of the territory’s population – has reached IPC Phase 5, the technical threshold for famine.\nBy the end of September, the panel expects famine conditions to extend to Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis, putting nearly two-thirds of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents at severe risk.\nThe crisis stems from a catastrophic collapse of Gaza’s local food system.\nAccording to the IPC, 98% of cropland is damaged, inaccessible or destroyed, livestock populations have been decimated, and fishing – a vital source of protein – remains banned.\nMarkets are nearly empty, commercial imports remain limited and unaffordable, and most residents rely entirely on aid, which continues to flow erratically due to border restrictions and ongoing conflict.\nIsrael imposed a near-total blockade in March 2025, halting most humanitarian supplies for months.\nThough limited aid deliveries resumed in late May, volumes are far too low and distribution remains chaotic.\nA U.N. aid report notes that approximately 90% of food trucked into Gaza is diverted or never reaches those most in need.\n“The overall volume of nutrition supplies remains completely insufficient to prevent further deterioration,” said Rik Peeperkorn, World Health Organization representative in Palestine. “The market needs to be flooded. Dietary diversity is essential, but it is largely absent.”\nChildren are among the most vulnerable. Malnutrition is surging, with fortified milk, high-energy biscuits and therapeutic pastes in critically short supply.\nUNICEF estimates that only 2,500 of the 10,000 babies who need formula currently have access to it.\nHospitals report alarming increases in child mortality from malnutrition: Gaza’s Health Ministry recorded 133 deaths in the first 20 days of August alone, including 25 children under 18.\nAt Rantisi Hospital in Gaza City, the human toll is stark.\nThree-month-old Kholoud al-Aqra weighs just 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) – far below the World Health Organization’s average of 6 kilograms for girls her age.\nHer mother, Heba al-Aqra, is severely malnourished and struggles to produce enough milk. “I feel dizzy when I breastfeed her because there is no good food for me,” she said.\nFamilies, desperate for nourishment, resort to wild plants and minimal soups to sustain infants and children.\nJeanette Bailey, child nutrition lead at the International Rescue Committee, called the crisis “the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe we can measure,” warning that malnourished children and pregnant women are at risk of severe illness or death without immediate intervention.\nGaza’s health care system is under immense strain.\nHospitals are overwhelmed, medical supplies are scarce, and access to safe drinking water and sanitation is limited.\nThe WHO and other agencies report that infections are spreading rapidly in overcrowded shelters, and malnourished populations have compromised immune systems, exacerbating vulnerability to disease.\nThe IPC uses stringent criteria to define famine: at least 20% of households must face extreme food scarcity, 30% of children under five must be acutely malnourished, and two deaths per 10,000 people per day must result from starvation or malnutrition-related illness.\nCurrent reports indicate Gaza meets all three thresholds.\nThe humanitarian crisis is entangled in politics. Israel disputes malnutrition figures and attributes deaths to other medical conditions.\nHamas officials insist that famine conditions are “more grave than reported” and call for immediate aid access.\nBoth sides have accused each other of obstructing assistance.\nAid organizations have highlighted logistical and security challenges.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), working with Samaritan’s Purse, has distributed 150,000 supplemental nutrition packs, enough for roughly 5,000 children for a month.\nHowever, these figures fall far short of actual need, and malnourished children often cannot access therapeutic foods consistently.\nFletcher and other U.N. officials emphasize that this famine is not inevitable.\nFood exists but cannot reach the people who need it.\nWithout a dramatic increase in aid and commercial imports, experts warn the crisis will worsen, particularly for children under five and other vulnerable groups.\n“Without sustained entry of specialized nutrition supplements, this preventable crisis will become a full-blown nutrition emergency,” said Antoine Renard, country director for the World Food Programme in Palestine."

      "text": "Parts of Gaza are officially experiencing a “man-made” famine, according to a Friday report by a United Nations-backed initiative, which added that the situation is expected to worsen after months of relentless conflict.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) found that famine has been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City, now also the site of a major new Israeli offensive.\n“As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed.”\nThe IPC called for an immediate ceasefire, saying that without a truce that allows humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, “avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”\nDuring nearly two years of war in Gaza, Israel has at times restricted or cut off the entry of aid to the ravaged enclave.\nWhile some people have died of starvation and hunger, others have been killed trying to receive aid at distribution sites run by the controversial US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was brought in place to replace a UN system long criticized by Israel.\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said Saturday that the UN should declare itself “corrupt” and “incompetent” after the IPC declaration of famine.\n“The (international) media is missing the real story of ‘famine’ in Gaza. Hostages ARE starving, Hamas is getting fat, & the UN declares famine while 92% of THEIR food is stolen to be sold by Hamas,” Huckabee posted on X. “Meanwhile UN food sits rotting in sun. The UN should declare itself corrupt & incompetent.”\nThe Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli agency tasked with facilitating aid distribution in Gaza, rejected the IPC report ahead of its release, saying it “relies on partial, biased data and superficial information originating from Hamas.”\nCOGAT said that the IPC’s “one-sided approach completely disregards the extensive humanitarian efforts undertaken in Gaza,” adding that the report ignored information provided to its authors by Israel.\nIt also stated that in terms of aid the “overall trend has shifted” in Gaza, but that Hamas has continued to exploit humanitarian supplies.\nAid groups, the UN and harrowing testimony and images emerging from Gaza have, however, painted a different picture.\nUS President Donald Trump last month said there is “real starvation” in Gaza, contradicting statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said that no one is starving in the territory.\n‘No more excuses’\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said the famine reported in Gaza is “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\n“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population,” Guterres added. “We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity. No more excuses.”\nTom Fletcher, the UN emergency relief coordinator, urged the world to read the IPC report “from cover to cover.”\n“Read it in sorrow and anger, not as words and numbers but names and lives. Be in no doubt that this irrefutable testimony. It is a famine, the Gaza famine. The famine that we could have prevented if we were allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” Fletcher said Friday at a news briefing.\nAmnesty International called the IPC’s findings “a scathing indictment of the failure of states to press Israel into ending its genocide in the occupied Gaza Strip” and said the report confirmed what human rights and aid groups have long been warning of.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF all reiterated that “famine must be stopped at all costs” and expressed serious concern about the threat of an intensified offensive in Gaza City.\nCNN, along with other media outlets, has widely reported on hunger and starvation in Gaza.\nArab nations including Kuwait, Jordan and Saudi Arabia condemned the situation, as did the UK, and New York City’s mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.\nLast month, CNN reported the death of 4-year-old Razan Abu Zaher, who died at a hospital in central Gaza from complications brought on by malnutrition, according to a medical source. Her skeletal body was laid out on a slab of stone.\nTwo more deaths due to starvation were recorded Thursday by the Palestinian health ministry, bringing the total number of those who died of malnutrition to 271, including 112 children.\nFriday’s IPC report added that “malnutrition threatens the lives of 132,000 children under five through June 2026, including 41,000 severe cases, doubling May’s numbers.”\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan’s western Darfur region last year.\nThis is the first time the IPC has confirmed famine in the Middle East.\nUnder the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met.\nThose conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished or 15% of children suffering from acute malnutrition based on body measurements, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nIsrael accused the IPC of lowering its global standard for famine only for Gaza, an accusation which the organization said was “completely false,” pointing out that the same standard has been in use since 2019.\n‘Of course there is famine’\nPalestinians living in Gaza City, many of whom were displaced from other corners of the enclave, say it is high time the city is classified as being in famine, which they say they have endured for months.\n“This classification comes at the right time to show the world the magnitude of the tragedy and catastrophe in the Gaza Strip,” Ahed Ferwana, a Palestinian journalist and analyst residing in Gaza City, told CNN. “The strip has been suffering for months from starvation on the hands of (Israeli) aggression and closure of border crossings.”\nBisan Gazal, a displaced woman in the city, said that “of course there is famine,” adding that she and her family sometimes have one meal a day, while other days they don’t eat at all.\n“Sometimes we find nothing to eat, it’s very hard,” she told CNN on Friday. “Our children fall asleep in tears.”\nTawfeeq Abu Rajad, another displaced man living in western Gaza City, said that food prices are skyrocketing and there is little to no protein available.\nThe IPC designation of Gaza as in famine is “accurate,” he said.\n“We hope that all entities and international establishments put an end to this famine as soon as possible.”\nCNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

      "text": "Famine is occurring in Gaza, the leading global tracker of food insecurity announced on Friday, pointing to “catastrophic” conditions for more than half a million Palestinians — including tens of thousands of children edging toward death via acute malnutrition — largely because of Israeli policies enabled by extensive U.S. support.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is officially applying the famine classification to Gaza for the first time since the nearly two-year Israeli campaign there began, saying famine is confirmed in the governorate, including Gaza City, the region Israeli forces are preparing to target in a new offensive. The IPC, considered the gold standard for tracking hunger, is a consortium that includes 21 United Nations agencies and major nongovernmental aid groups.\n“As this famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the 59-page report states. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay — even by days — will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.”\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry rejected the IPC’s findings, declaring that “there is no famine in Gaza,” and accusing the group of producing a “fabricated report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign.”\n“The entire IPC document is based on Hamas lies laundered through organizations with vested interests,” it said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n“This assessment too will be thrown into the despicable trash bin of political documents,” it continued.\nIn September, famine is expected to expand to two other governorates, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the IPC added. The group noted it was unable to secure data about north Gaza, one of the hardest-hit areas during the war. The IPC also noted that the number of children under five who could die by starvation has doubled since its last projection in May; it now anticipates that at least 132,000 will be in that category by June 2026. It described the deterioration among Palestinians as the most severe it has recorded anywhere in the world since its founding in 2004.\n“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies, and basic health, nutrition, and WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially,” the report adds.\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres renewed calls for an end to the violence unfolding in Gaza, denouncing the dire conditions faced by Palestinians there.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine,’” he said.\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said the famine detailed in the IPC report is “the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government.”\n“It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing,” Türk said in a statement.\nThe IPC finding represents a chilling milestone for the war. While warnings of mass hunger and fatal starvation in the region spread, U.S. and Israeli officials have mostly ignored extensive pleas to end policies like severe Israeli restrictions on the entry of supplies to Gaza and ongoing Israeli attacks on the strip, which have repeatedly hit humanitarian workers and made it hard for them to distribute goods. Previous research by the IPC and other experts, including U.S. government officials, had suggested famine was occurring but then was abated by tweaks in policies around aid, confirming that policymakers’ choices made the situation more desperate.\n“Israel caused the famine confirmed today in Gaza Governorate, but the United States has made it possible, supplying the arms, funding, and political cover at every step leading to this tragic point,” Scott Paul, the director of peace and security at Oxfam America, said in a statement. “Now, the Trump administration must do all in its power to reach an immediate, permanent ceasefire, ensure there is a sustained surge of aid, and the release of all hostages and illegally detained prisoners. The U.S. should suspend offensive arms sales to Israel now. There is not a second to waste while more people die from starvation every day.”\nPaul’s group is among those currently unable to get help to Palestinians, despite being prepared to do so. Oxfam says it has $2.5 million worth of aid in warehouses adjacent to Gaza that Israeli authorities refuse to allow in.\nIsrael offers several often conflicting arguments about hunger among Palestinians: that sufficient food is available; that militants, chiefly the faction Hamas, steal aid en masse (a claim which officials in Israel, the U.N. and the U.S. have rejected); and that it is supporting a functioning aid system through a program called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has also received U.S. funding.\nAmerican military contractors and Israeli troops shield the GHF, which was established in May after long-standing Israeli opposition to other humanitarian groups and attacks at GHF distribution points had killed more than 1,400 Palestinians. The GHF claims those casualty numbers are exaggerated and highlights its delivery of meals, though the packages it supplies are hard to use since they usually require water and fuel, which are in short supply.\nWith the famine announcement, “the number of people crossing that threshold into [their malnutrition] being non-survivable while still being alive is just devastating … it’s apocalyptic,” said Mark Brauner, an American doctor who volunteered in Gaza earlier this summer and described his experience to HuffPost. Brauner said he receives updates, including photographs, from Palestinians he worked alongside and cannot recognize them from seven weeks ago because of how hunger is wearing away at them.\n“They’ve taken on a completely different physicality,” he said. “They’re truly becoming skeletal, and you can see that the skin is like paper.”\nObservers note that a key reason Palestinians are particularly vulnerable to food shortages now is that most of Gaza’s population has faced repeated forced displacements and near-starvation levels before.\nUnder President Joe Biden, who largely resisted calls to pressure Israel as he surged support to the country following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, U.S. officials found famine was occurring in April 2024, HuffPost revealed, and U.N. experts reached similar conclusions in July and November 2024. President Donald Trump has largely built on Biden’s permissive policy toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, endorsing some of his most extreme ideas, like the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.\n“The United States government has a longstanding commitment to prevent famine, but it has fueled one in Gaza,” Paul said.\nMarita Vlachou contributed reporting."

      "text": "For the first time, the world’s food crises authority announces a famine in Gaza\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The world’s leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip’s largest city is gripped by famine, and that it’s likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nThe determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel’s restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nIsrael rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.”\nGaza City offensive could exacerbate hunger\nThe grim milestone — the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East — is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been fighting Hamas since the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to seize Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, an escalation experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said.\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the findings show a “human-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself” and appealed for an “immediate ceasefire.”\nIsrael disputes the report\nNetanyahu denies there’s hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas. “The IPC report is an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” his office posted on X.\nThe U.S. State Department also sought to cast doubt on the report. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “is a serious concern,” but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid.\nAfter the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths in recent weeks, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the United Nations says what’s entering is far below what’s needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, known as COGAT, called the report “false and biased.” It said significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. But experts say Gaza is still reeling from the tightening of the blockade from early March until mid-May, when Israel barred the import of all food, medicine and other goods.\n“A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel’s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\nHow a famine is determined\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\nAt least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15% of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza’s population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\nAlex de Waal, author of “Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine” and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n“It seems that it’s necessary for experts to shout ‘famine!’ before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,” he said.\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there’s currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\nThe traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\nWitnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\nA parent in Gaza City watches his children waste away\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington.\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighborhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City’s Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Thousands will be too weak to evacuate the city ahead of the planned offensive, said Blacka.\nFamilies in Gaza City say they’re watching their loved ones waste away.\nYousef Sbeteh’s two teenage children were wounded by an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they’ve both lost weight because there hasn’t been enough food, he said, adding that he can’t afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.\nHis 15-year-old daughter, Aya, lost nearly 20 kilograms (44 pounds), or about 30% of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n“Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,” Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. “But I can’t provide that now.”\n___\nMednick reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

      "text": "The United Nations-backed organization responsible for monitoring global hunger is set to declare a famine in Gaza City on Friday morning, according to documents obtained by The Daily Wire.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed watchdog made up of Western governments, the United Nations, and nonprofit groups, will classify the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a famine. It will declare that the crisis is projected to spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.\nThis will be only the fifth time the IPC has declared a famine since its founding in 2004, and the first time it has classified two famines simultaneously, following its designation of Sudan in 2024. It is the first famine declared in the Middle East by the IPC.\nThe announcement comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advances plans for his military to seize Gaza City by October 7, 2025—the anniversary of Hamas’s massacre of Israeli civilians. Israel’s effort aims to free the hostages, defeat Hamas, and establish a new, demilitarized Arab government that is neither the Palestinian Authority nor Hamas. Israel is preparing for mass evacuations in Gaza City and some Gazans have already left as the first phases of the offensive begin, reported the BBC.\nNETANYAHU CONFIRMS ISRAEL’S PLANS TO FULLY TAKE CONTROL OF GAZA\nThe IPC’s classification model came under fire last week after a Washington Free Beacon report accused the organization of quietly relying on a less reliable metric to determine the presence of a famine. According to the Beacon, previous IPC reports relied on detailed height and weight measurements, but its July report introduced the “mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)” metric, which was not typically used by the organization in determining a famine classification.\nMuch of the raw data the IPC relies upon are sourced from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health or other terror-linked organizations, one of the least reliable sources of accurate information, the Beacon added.\nIsrael’s Ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, took to X Thursday evening ahead of the report to accuse the IPC of promoting Hamas propaganda and publishing misleading reports.\nThe evidence continues to mount that the campaign to demonize Israel through false accusations of starving Gazans is an orchestrated effort by U.N. agencies promoting Hamas propaganda.\nNow, to further advance the malicious accusation the IPC is publishing a report “documenting”… pic.twitter.com/l3HS2LAsD7\n— Ambassador Yechiel (Michael) Leiter (@yechielleiter) August 21, 2025\n“An objective assessment of the IPC report exposes a systematic lowering of standards: neutrality of safeguards abandoned, critical stakeholders excluded, data selectively used, projections skewed toward worst cases, famine thresholds bent until they no longer matched the IPC manual itself, and transparency sidelined as key datasets and analytical reasoning remain inaccessible to outside scrutiny,” Leiter posted.\nLeiter referred to an Israeli government report making several accusations against the IPC including that it lacks neutrality, its history of off-target humanitarian predictions, and data concerns.\nAccording to the Network Contagion Research Institute’s report on the IPC, eighty percent of Gaza’s subregions “were exaggerated into higher famine phases than actually existed, making Gaza the single most overprotected region in the IPC’s recent global record.”\nDEATH PENALTY ON THE TABLE FOR KILLER OF ISRAELI EMBASSY STAFFERS\nMost notably, the Israeli report points to the IPC’s July report’s description of a 15 percent MUAC reference point for children as a “famine threshold” — even though in the organization’s manual, it uses this point as only a cutoff for its Phase 4 “emergency” classification, not its Phase 5 “famine” classification.\n“By using the ‘famine threshold’ misnomer, IPC blurred a key distinction in its own classification system, lowering the bar for famine designations and making the situation appear worse than the data justified,” the Israeli report stated.\nThe Israeli report also alleged that much of the data comes from clinic-based screenings, despite IPC guidance prohibiting such sources. Children brought to clinics are more likely to be sick and malnourished than the general population.\nEXCLUSIVE: NEW EVIDENCE CALLS INTO QUESTION VIRAL STORY OF GAZAN BOY ‘AMIR’ KILLED AT GHF AID SITE\n“MUAC was stripped of the contextualisation required by IPC’s own rules, thresholds were misrepresented, and clinic screenings were treated as if they were population surveys,” the report added. “Each of these shortcuts tilted the analysis toward more severe classifications than the evidence could sustain.”\nIPC’s May report detected a “risk of a famine” which came at a time when the Israeli-imposed blockade on Gaza was just being lifted, yet its July report showed a “rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.” It went so far as to say that “access to food and other essential items and services have plummeted to unprecedented levels,” despite an increase in aid both through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the United Nations.\nEnd of Summer Sale – Get 40% off New DailyWire+ Annual Memberships\nAccording to the United Nations’ 2720 Mechanism for Gaza, in July, 19.8 thousand metric tonnes of humanitarian aid was delivered into Gaza, a 56% increase from June 2025 and a 140% increase from April 2024. In February 2025, 19.5K metric tonnes were delivered into Gaza, which was drastically higher than any of the 10 previous months, apart from January which saw 13.7K metric tonnes delivered.\nThe problem however, comes from the aid being looted when being driven to UN aid sites, or the UN failing to deliver it at all, leaving thousands of truckloads of food to spoil in the hot sun. The Daily Wire previously reported on exclusive footage showing a mobs attacking more than a dozen trucks carrying aid, led by vehicles marched with UN insignia."

The confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa, and fifth since 2004.\nSaturday 23 August 2025 00:34, UK\nA famine has been declared in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhoods.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition - has confirmed just four famines since it was established in 2004.\nThese were in Somalia in 2011, and in Sudan in 2017, 2020, and 2024.\nThe confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa.\n\"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,\" the report said, adding that more than a million other people face a severe level of food insecurity.\nOver the next month, conditions are also expected to worsen, with the famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the report said.\nNearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions, while acute malnutrition is projected to continue getting worse rapidly.\nThe report said at least 132,000 children will suffer from acute malnutrition over the next year - double the organisation's estimates from May 2024.\nThe IPC said the situation could be even worse further north in Gaza, but limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael says no famine in Gaza\nVolker Turk, the UN Human Rights chief, said the famine is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government.\n\"It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of wilful killing,\" he said.\nCOGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, has rejected the findings.\nIsrael's foreign ministry said there is no famine in Gaza: \"Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets.\"\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the report was an \"outright lie\", adding that Israel \"does not have a policy of starvation\".\n\"Israel has a policy of preventing starvation. Since the beginning of the war Israel has enabled 2 million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip, over one ton of aid per person,\" he said in a statement.\nCeasefire pleas to stop famine\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the IPC report \"utterly horrifying and wholly preventable\", and demanded that Israel immediately allow unhindered supplies of food, medicines and fuel into Gaza.\n\"We desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine,\" Mr Lammy said in a statement.\nTom Fletcher, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, echoed Mr Lammy's comments as he made a desperate plea to Mr Netanyahu to declare a ceasefire in the wake of the famine announcement.\n\"My ask, my plea, my demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu and anyone who can reach him. Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south, all of them,\" he said.\nRead more from Sky News:\nTrump critic has home raided by the FBI\nMultiple people killed in tour bus crash\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Gaza famine was a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\".\nThe IPC had previously warned famine was imminent in parts of Gaza, but had stopped short of a formal declaration.\nThe latest report on Gaza from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there were almost 13,000 new admissions of children for acute malnutrition recorded in July.\nThe latest numbers from the Gaza health ministry are 251 dead as a result of famine and malnutrition, including 108 children.\nBut Israel has previously accused Hamas of inflating these figures, saying that most of the children who died had pre-existing health conditions."

      "text": "The United Nations has officially confirmed a famine in Gaza, blaming \"systematic obstruction\" of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of war, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly dismissing the findings.\nPalestinian militant group Hamas urged the United Nations to \"stop the war and lift the siege\", calling for unrestricted access for food, medicine, water and fuel.\nMr Netanyahu, whose defence minister meanwhile threatened an even more intense offensive, rejected the UN-backed report as \"an outright lie\".\nThe Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in the Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.\nIsrael has pressed ahead with plans to seize Gaza City despite an international outcry, saying that taking the territory's largest city is key to defeating Hamas.\nThe IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, covering around two-thirds of Gaza.\nWith the vast majority of the territory's population displaced at least once, the UN said nearly a million people currently live in the northern Gaza governorate.\nUN agencies and aid groups had warned for months of a looming famine in Gaza, where Israel has severely restricted aid and at times completely cut it off during its nearly two-year war with Hamas.\nCOGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, including coordinating aid to Gaza, argued that the IPC's findings rely on \"partial data and unreliable sources\".\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to Palestinians in need \"because of systematic obstruction by Israel\".\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a ceasefire, saying: \"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.\"\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said it was \"a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\", a charge for which the International Criminal Court in November issued an arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu.\nIn a statement, Mr Netanyahu said \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation\", citing figures on aid it had allowed into Gaza.\nThe IPC report said that \"over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death\".\nIt said the deterioration between July and August was the most severe since it began analysing hunger in Gaza, driven by a sharp escalation in the war and restrictions on supplies.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid from Gaza for two months.\nWatch: UN aid chief says Israel engaging in 'systemic obstruction' of food\nSpeaking in Geneva,Tom Fletcher said: \"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said the famine determination \"must serve as a catalyst for immediate and concrete action\".\nBritain's top diplomat David Lammy said Israel's \"refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.\"\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz earlier warned that \"the gates of hell will open upon\" Hamas leaders, specifically in Gaza City, \"until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war, primarily the release of all hostages and their disarmament\".\nMilitary chief Eyal Zamir said \"we are expanding operations in Gaza in the coming days\".\nLast night, Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered negotiations aimed at freeing the hostages still held in Gaza since the Hamas attack that triggered the war, 49 people, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.\nThe Israeli premier said the diplomatic push would accompany the operation to take control of Gaza City.\nMediators have been waiting for an official Israeli response to their latest ceasefire proposal, which Hamas accepted earlier this week.\nOn the ground, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 57 people today, more than half of them in Gaza City.\nUmm Mohammed Nasr, a 42-year-old mother of four from Gaza City, said that \"the bombing hasn't stopped since this morning ... but we have no idea where to go\".\nRead more:\nMiddle East stories\nHow does the IPC global hunger monitor determine famine?\nIsrael vows to destroy Gaza City if Hamas doesn't disarm, release hostages\n\"We are dying,\" she said.\nMedia restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency or the Israeli military.\nHamas's October 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.\nAccreditation: Reuters/AFP"

      "text": "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-supported entity tasked with assessing global hunger, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City for the first time.\nEstablished in 2004, the IPC has only recognized four famines, the last being in Sudan last year. Despite previous warnings about imminent famine in Gaza, the IPC hesitated to formalize a declaration due to insufficient data until now.\nThe declaration comes as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu intensifies the genocidal war in Gaza City, which is inhabited by approximately 500,000 people.\nNetanyahu has previously denied the existence of famine in the region.\nTo meet the criteria for declaring a famine, the IPC dictates that at least 20% of households must experience extreme food scarcity, 30% of children must suffer from acute malnutrition, and a minimum of two people per 10,000 must die daily from starvation.\nThe IPC will classify the famine as occurring in the \"Gaza Governorate,\" which includes Gaza City and surrounding towns.\nAccording to the IPC briefing, the situation in Gaza is catastrophic, with more than half a million residents facing dire conditions marked by food deprivation and mortality.\nThe famine is expected to spread to other areas by the end of September, affecting approximately 1.07 million people, who are currently in a state of \"emergency\" food insecurity.\nNetanyahu faces significant international criticism for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, prompting Israel to announce measures to facilitate the entry of more aid. He asserted that \"hundreds of trucks\" have been allowed entry and refuted that Israel is implementing a \"starvation policy.\"\nIn anticipation of a full-scale military takeover of Gaza City, Israel has mobilized 60,000 reservists. Israeli forces are reported to have established positions on the city's outskirts amidst ongoing airstrikes, leading to the mass displacement of residents.\nThe IPC and its partner organizations, including Save the Children and UNICEF, predict worsening food security conditions in Gaza over the coming months. Nearly a third of Gaza's population is expected to face catastrophic living conditions, while those in emergency status could rise to 1.14 million.\nThis declaration marks a historic event as it is the first officially recognized famine in the Middle East, and only the fifth time the IPC has issued a famine declaration, with previous instances occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn the context of the ongoing war, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that 271 individuals had succumbed to starvation, 112 of whom were children.\nIsrael unleashed its brutal Gaza onslaught on October 7, 2023, after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the Zionist entity in response to the regime's decades-long campaign of death and destruction against Palestinians.\nThe genocidal war has so far killed nearly 62,122 Palestinians and injured 156,758 others, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry of Gaza.\nIsrael has sealed all border crossings, blocking the entry of aid and further worsening Gaza's already dire humanitarian crisis since March 2, when it violated its ceasefire agreement with Hamas."

Children are dying of starvation, aid is being obstructed, and entire communities face humanitarian collapse. This should compel urgent action from the international community—not provide justification for further delay.\nRecognition of the State of Palestine is not a symbolic gesture; it is a vital step toward ensuring the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, international legal standing, and protection under global institutions. Already, the majority of UN member states, along with New Zealand’s key democratic partners, have taken this step.\nBy hesitating, New Zealand risks isolating itself among its allies and undermining the prospects of a two-state solution. Recognition must be principled and unconditional, not tied to shifting political preconditions. The confirmation of famine should accelerate New Zealand’s decision, not stall it.\nWe call on the New Zealand Government to:\n- Recognise the State of Palestine without delay, aligning with the upcoming UN General Assembly session in September.\n- Match humanitarian urgency with political will, ensuring New Zealand is not complicit in perpetuating injustice through inaction.\n- Stand firmly on the side of peace, justice, and human dignity, consistent with New Zealand’s proud history of upholding international law.\nAt this critical moment, leadership requires courage. The Palestinian people cannot wait any longer for recognition of their fundamental rights."

The report calls for an immediate ceasefire to allow large-scale humanitarian access.\nYet, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) strongly disputes the findings, claiming that the IPC’s methodology is flawed, its data politicized, and that the reality on the ground reflects unprecedented levels of humanitarian assistance.\nThe IPC declared that Gaza Governorate is already in Phase 5 (Famine), with famine projected to spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of September.

Footage extensively shared on social media depicted women and children queuing up with empty pails and buckets, with others scooping leftover grains of rice by hand.\nFifty-eight-year-old Yousuf Hammad, displaced from Beit Hanoun, described the misery: “We have no home, no food, no income. Charity kitchens are our only hope, but even they cannot satisfy our hunger.”\nIn Deir al-Balah, a mother of four, Umm Muhammad, criticized the UN’s announcement as “too little, too late.” She said her children often collapse from hunger and dehydration. “They are too weak to even stay awake,” she lamented.\nBased on the UN’s most recent assessment, over half a million individuals in Gaza are already hit by acute famine, a crisis set to expand still deeper into Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by September’s end.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), charged Israel directly with evading the humanitarian disaster it has unleashed. “Israel refuses to recognize the famine that it has created in Gaza. It is time for its government to wake up,” he stated.\nIsrael, though, refused to accept the findings of the UN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded the report “a complete lie.” Israeli bombing, in the meantime, continues to level residential areas, driving thousands of families out in search of refuge.\nResidents claim there is no longer a safe place left to go. “We are sleeping on the streets like animals. There is no shelter left for us,” claimed one man who was forced out of Gaza City.\nThe escalating humanitarian disaster accompanies international aid organizations’ warnings of mass deaths should immediate food and medicine not be permitted into the strip. Israel insists that adequate aid is reaching the territory, but aid agencies counter that the blockade and aerial attacks have rendered distribution all but impossible.\nFor the moment, Gazans have to deal with a bleak reality: hunger, displacement, and unending violence — as the world argues about the semantics of “famine” vs. “food insecurity.”\nWe welcome your contributions!

Another 1.14 million people are classified in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), while 396,000 are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), UNICEF, WFP, and the World Health Organization (WHO) jointly raised the alarm, stressing that famine must be stopped at all costs.\nThey called for an immediate ceasefire to allow large-scale humanitarian access, warning that any escalation of military operations in Gaza would have devastating consequences, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities who cannot evacuate.\nThe analysis confirms that famine thresholds of extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition, and starvation-related deaths have been breached.\nMeanwhile, the situation has been driven by almost two years of conflict, repeated displacement, the collapse of health and market systems, and severe restrictions on humanitarian access to food, water, and medical aid.\nFood insecurity has worsened dramatically since May. In July, the number of households reporting extreme hunger more than doubled across Gaza, and more than tripled in Gaza City.\nNearly 40 percent of the population reported going days without food, with many parents skipping meals to feed their children.\nChildren are bearing the brunt of the crisis. More than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished in July alone — the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year.\nHowever, nearly one in four are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, the deadliest form of hunger. The number of children at risk of death from malnutrition is projected to triple to 43,400 by mid-2026.\nPregnant and breastfeeding women are also severely affected, with 55,000 expected to face life-threatening malnutrition within the same period.\nThe statement read, \"The new assessment reports the most severe deterioration since the IPC began analyzing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, and it marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region.\n\"Since July, food and aid supplies entering Gaza increased slightly but remained vastly insufficient, inconsistent and inaccessible compared to the need.\n\"Meanwhile, approximately 98 percent of cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible – decimating the agriculture sector and local food production – and nine of ten people have been serially displaced from homes. Cash is critically scarce, aid operations remain severely disrupted, with most UN trucks looted amid growing desperation. Food prices are extremely high and there is not enough fuel and water to cook and medicines and medical supplies.\"\nAccording to the world organisation Gaza’s health system has severely deteriorated, access to safe drinking water and sanitation services has been drastically reduced, while multi-drug resistant infections are surging and levels of morbidity – including diarrhea, fever, acute respiratory and skin infections – are alarmingly high among children.\nTo enable lifesaving humanitarian operations, the U.N. agencies emphasised the importance of an immediate and sustained ceasefire to stop the killing, allow for the safe release of hostages and permit unimpeded access for a mass influx of assistance to reach people across Gaza.\nThey stressed the urgent need for greater amounts of food aid, along with dramatically improved delivery, distribution and accessibility, as well as shelter, fuel, cooking gas and food production inputs.\nThey emphasised that it is critical to support the rehabilitation of the health system, maintain and revive essential health services, including primary health care, and ensure sustained delivery of health supplies into and across Gaza.\nHowever, the restoration of commercial flows at scale, market systems, essential services, and local food production is also vital if the worst outcomes of the famine are to be avoided.\nAccording to FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, “People in Gaza have exhausted every possible means of survival. Hunger and malnutrition are claiming lives every day, and the destruction of cropland, livestock, greenhouses, fishery and food production systems has made the situation even more dire.\n“Our priority must now be safe and sustained access for large-scale food assistance. Access to food is not a privilege – it is a basic human right.”\n“Famine warnings have been clear for months,” said Cindy McCain, WFP Executive Director. “What’s urgently needed now is a surge of aid, safer conditions, and proven distribution systems to reach those most in need - wherever they are. Full humanitarian access and a ceasefire now are critical to save lives.”\n“Famine is now a grim reality for children in Gaza Governorate, and a looming threat in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.\n“As we have repeatedly warned, the signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat; babies dying from hunger and preventable disease; parents arriving at clinics with nothing left to feed their children. There is no time to lose. Without an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access, famine will spread, and more children will die. Children on the brink of starvation need the special therapeutic feeding that UNICEF provides.”\n“A ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n“The world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine. Widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases like diarrhea are becoming fatal, especially for children. The health system, run by hungry and exhausted health workers, cannot cope. Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines to save lives and begin the process of reversing malnutrition.\n\"Hospitals must be protected so that they can continue treating patients. Aid blockages must end, and peace must be restored, so that healing can begin.”"

      "text": "The United Nations officially declared a famine in Gaza on August 22, 2025, the first-ever famine declaration in West Asia. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), over 514,000 Palestinians-one-quarter of the population-are enduring catastrophic starvation in Gaza, with numbers expected to rise to nearly 641,000 by the end of September.\nThe famine has been attributed directly to restrictions imposed on food, fuel, and medical aid access by Israel amid almost two years of conflict following Hamas’s October 7, 2023, incursion. While Israel rejects claims of famine, UN officials and humanitarian agencies call the crisis a dire, preventable man-made disaster demanding urgent humanitarian access and ceasefire.\nFamine Reality: Starvation and Collapse of Food Systems\nGaza’s farming, fishing, and food supply systems have disintegrated under the weight of conflict and blockade. The IPC report confirmed that Gaza City and surrounding areas are engulfed in Phase 5 famine-the highest level of acute food insecurity-characterised by widespread starvation, malnutrition, and increasing mortality due to hunger and related diseases.\nAt least one-third of children under five suffer acute malnutrition, while 20% of households face extreme food shortages. Most cropland is inaccessible or damaged, livestock numbers have plummeted, and fishing remains banned by Israeli restrictions. Health services are strained to breaking point, and safe water and sanitation are partially unavailable. UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher warned that the famine is “entirely preventable,” lamenting that food continues to pile up at Gaza’s borders, blocked from those in desperate need.\nThe Conflict Culprit: Blockades and Denials\nThe humanitarian crisis stems from nearly two years of Israeli restrictions on goods entering Gaza, following Hamas’s October 2023 attacks. These blockades intensified into near-total bans on aid supplies from March to May 2025, only partially eased later under international pressure.\nA controversial American-managed food distribution system replaced the previous UN-led programme, dramatically reducing access points and increasing the dangers to Palestinians who risk violence when seeking aid. Since May, nearly 1,760 Palestinians have died trying to access food distribution centers, with hundreds shot by Israeli forces—claims repeatedly denied by Israel.\nThe Israeli government dismisses the famine declaration as a “fabricated report” based on Hamas data and denies systematic obstruction, arguing that aid trucks remain unused at crossings. However, UN Secretary-General António Guterres reproached Israel for violating international humanitarian law by blocking food and medical supplies to the occupied territory.\nInternational Urgency and Calls for Compassionate Action\nUN agencies including WHO, UNICEF, FAO, and the World Food Programme issued joint statements urging immediate, unimpeded aid access. The UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called starvation a weapon of war and a potential war crime. The famine’s declaration has intensified global appeals for a ceasefire and humanitarian corridors, as military actions in Gaza City threaten to displace one million Palestinians already caught in famine conditions.\nThe international community faces mounting pressure to prevent further loss of civilian lives by prioritising compassion, dialogue, and political will.\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\nThe famine in Gaza underscores the heartbreaking human consequences of protracted conflict and restricted humanitarian access. It lays bare how war zones become grounds for preventable suffering when politics inhibit life-saving relief.\nThe Logical Indian reaffirms the need to transcend polarisation and champion peace, empathy, and coexistence. Starvation is not just a statistic but a profound moral imperative to act with kindness and respect for human dignity. The world must amplify voices demanding de-escalation and swift aid to all in need."

      "text": "Famine is gripping Gaza, affecting roughly half a million people, or a quarter of its population. This crisis is unfolding despite hundreds of aid trucks sitting outside the territory’s borders. According to the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the situation is “entirely man-made,” with aid organizations accusing Israel of systematically obstructing food supplies.\nResidents in Gaza City are already facing extreme hunger, with the threat of famine spreading to other regions by September if current trends continue.\nThe IPC identified famine through three key indicators: starvation, malnutrition, and mortality. At least one in five households suffers from severe food shortages, while roughly one in three children is acutely malnourished.\nMortality rates, although difficult to measure due to disrupted monitoring systems, are believed to meet famine thresholds. Gaza’s health ministry reported 273 deaths from malnutrition, including 112 children, underscoring the severity of the crisis.\nGaza’s Food Access Severely Limited By Blockade And Dangerous Distribution System\nAccess to food in Gaza has long been restricted, but the situation deteriorated sharply after Israel’s war began on October 7, 2023. Since March 2025, a near-total blockade on goods entering Gaza has exacerbated the crisis.\nLimited aid re-entry began in late May, but Israel replaced the UN food distribution system with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), reducing the number of accessible distribution points from 400 to four and forcing Palestinians to risk their lives to collect aid.\nAccessing food has become dangerous. UN records show at least 1,760 Palestinians have been killed trying to obtain aid, with 994 fatalities near GHF distribution sites, most allegedly caused by Israeli forces. Palestinians face life-threatening risks just to survive, highlighting the deadly consequences of restricted aid and militarized distribution systems.\nIn late July, Israel allowed more aid trucks and occasional pauses in fighting to facilitate deliveries. Prices of essentials, including flour, remain exorbitantly high, often exceeding $85 per kilo. Despite increased shipments, aid agencies report that current entry restrictions allow only half of the required 600 trucks per day, leaving many Palestinians without sufficient food. Airdrops, though implemented, are criticized as inefficient and dangerous.\nIsrael Denies Responsibility While Global Leaders Condemn Famine And Warn Of Consequences\nIsrael has denied responsibility for the famine, blaming Hamas and claiming aid agencies are at fault. Internal US reports found no evidence of systematic diversion of aid by Hamas. Widespread looting occurs, but is mostly carried out by desperate Palestinians, not organized groups diverting aid. The IPC and UN emphasize that unfettered, road-based aid access is essential to prevent starvation.\nThe IPC’s famine report faced criticism from Israel, which called it biased and based on partial data. However, UN agencies and international leaders condemned the man-made crisis. Secretary-General António Guterres called on Israel to fulfill its obligations under international law, while UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk highlighted that starving civilians constitutes a war crime.\nAmid famine, Israel has mobilized tens of thousands of reservists for a planned invasion of Gaza City, home to much of the affected population. The offensive could forcibly displace one million Palestinians, worsening starvation conditions. UN organizations warned that vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and disabled individuals, may be unable to evacuate, further amplifying the humanitarian catastrophe."

More than 500,000 Palestinians are currently affected by the crisis, with numbers projected to rise significantly.\nThis marks the first time the IPC has recorded famine conditions outside of Africa. The declaration follows nearly two years of conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy (Labour) described the situation as a \"moral outrage\" and \"utterly horrifying\". He attributed the crisis to Israel's refusal to allow sufficient humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nUN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher called the famine declaration \"irrefutable testimony\" to the deteriorating conditions.

The Israeli government has rejected the famine declaration as false and biased.\nIsrael claims to have delivered more than 10,000 aid trucks since May. However, UN officials state that 600 trucks daily are needed, while only around 300 are currently entering Gaza.\nThe IPC predicts famine conditions will spread to central and southern areas of Gaza by the end of September. According to multi-source reporting, the number of affected people could rise to between 614,000 and 641,000 by September's end.\nBBC reports indicate that 132,000 children under five are at risk of malnutrition through June 2026. Personal testimonies reveal the severity of the crisis, with one child's weight reportedly dropping from 19kg to 10.5kg due to famine conditions.\nSources used: \"Independent\", \"HuffPost UK\", \"The Standard\", \"BBC\", \"Daily Mail\"\nNote: This article has been edited with the help of Artificial Intelligence."

      "text": "After weeks of rising concern about hunger in Gaza, a United Nations-backed panel has declared that famine is underway in northern Gaza, warning that more than half a million people are on the brink of starvation as hunger spreads deeper into the densely populated Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed on Friday that famine has taken hold in the Gaza Governorate, encompassing Gaza City and nearby areas, and warned it could extend to central and southern Gaza by late September.\nThe declaration comes nearly two years into an armed conflict with Israel that was triggered by the October 7 invasion by Hamas. Israeli restrictions have limited the flow of food and aid into Gaza. Israel has long disputed claims about food insecurity in Gaza.\nWorld Food Programme’s Director of Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Jean-Martin Bauer noted that when a famine is declared, it means there is documentation of widespread starvation, widespread illness and widespread mortality.\nBut the declaration of famine is a complicated process.\nHere are five key points about the steps leading up to such a declaration.\nThere’s a very specific, internationally-agreed upon system for gauging hunger crises\nThe system the world relies on to track food emergencies began in the 1980s, said Tim Hoffine, now Deputy Chief of Party-Innovation at the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). In response to famines in East and West Africa, U.S. aid officials realized the need for a way to monitor global hunger. The goal, Hoffine said, was to provide “independent, timely and evidence-based analysis” to help decision makers prevent future famines.\nThat led to the founding in 1985 of FEWS NET by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to contract experts to collect and analyze data on at-risk areas monthly.\nStill, there was no universal standard to define the severity of hunger crises — making coordination among donors and aid groups difficult.\nAs former World Food Programme spokesperson Steve Taravella put it, “There is a serious need for the aid community to understand the levels of hunger in a scientific, authoritative way … We needed something reliable and authoritative that everybody working on these issues could use as a baseline.”\nSo in 2004, during a food emergency in Somalia, FEWS NET and international partners developed the “Integrated Food Security Phase Classification” initiative — or IPC.\n“It’s a mouthful of humanitarian jargon,” Taravella said, “but it’s basically the authoritative, respected, scientific mechanism for measuring levels of hunger in different areas.”\nThe IPC is coordinated by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome but brings together working groups of experts to analyze each crisis individually.\n“Donors wanted a single estimate of need,” Hoffine said. “And the IPC responded to that desire for consensus.”\nMultiple conditions need to be met before a location is technically considered in “famine”\nThe IPC categorizes hunger on a five-phase scale. FEWS NET, which monitors hunger hotspots monthly, also uses this system.\nPhase one means conditions are normal. In phase two, communities are “stressed” — still eating enough, but many households struggle to afford other essentials.\nAt phase three — a “crisis” level — “that’s where we start getting nervous,” Taravella said. People begin to have trouble getting enough food. “They might not have meals as often.” Many turn to short-term coping strategies that undermine long-term survival, like selling off livestock.\nIn phase four — “emergency” — hardships deepen. Food gaps widen, and people resort to “really extreme forms of coping,” Hoffine said. That might mean liquidating nearly all assets or eating seeds needed for future planting. Rates of acute malnutrition and excess deaths rise.\nOnly in phase five is a location considered in “famine.” Three criteria must be met: at least 20% of households face “catastrophe,” meaning, Hoffine explained, “an extreme lack of food that … leads to acute malnutrition and mortality.”\nSecond, at least 30% of children under five suffer from acute malnutrition, or wasting. Third, at least two of every 10,000 adults die each day from non-trauma causes. As Hoffine noted, hunger often kills not just through starvation, but by weakening immune systems to the point where people can’t fight off disease.\nFriday’s IPC analysis says Gaza City and surrounding areas are experiencing a Phase 5 famine, the highest level of acute food insecurity.\nFEWS NET lacks an operational presence in Gaza, posing potential challenges to monitoring acute food insecurity, but it says its analysis methods remain consistent with its standard project-wide practices.\nSome areas in Sudan have been declared to be facing famine conditions since 2024. Parts of South Sudan were declared in famine in 2020 and 2017.\nThere’s an even higher bar for actually declaring a famine\nEven if FEWS NET or the IPC determine that a location meets all three famine criteria, they can’t declare it on their own. Their findings must be reviewed and approved by a committee of independent experts convened by the IPC.\nStill, neither FEWS NET nor the IPC makes the official declaration. “It’s up to government institutions, United Nations upper leadership, and other high-level representatives to actually make a famine declaration,” Hoffine said.\nStarvation can occur long before famine is declared\nBecause all three thresholds must be met to trigger a famine designation, many people may be starving well before phase five is reached.\n“Until famine thresholds are breached, you would still have people dying from hunger or hunger-related mortality,” Hoffine explained. “So in Gaza you would still expect there to be mortality. And the longer this goes without a solution, the more that we can expect that sort of mortality to occur.”\nIt’s not too late to take action in Gaza — but time is running short\nHoffine and Taravella emphasized the caveats in their organizations’ reports are critical. Both FEWS NET and IPC say famine in Gaza can be alleviated if hostilities cease and aid workers are granted full access.\nThat’s the goal of the famine classification system: to alert the world before it’s too late. While higher-phase designations don’t mandate action, they are powerful tools for mobilizing a response, Taravella said. “It puts the world on notice.”\nHe cited WFP chief economist Arif Husain: “Several years ago, when [famines] happened in certain places, you could say, ‘I’m sorry. I did not know.’ Today we see crises in real time. So we cannot say we did not know.”\nMeanwhile, a famine declaration can carry weight, increasing pressure on governments and agencies to ramp up aid and on Israel to allow full humanitarian access. It could also lead to diplomatic fallout.\nFEWS NET said in a Friday statement: “Many months of starvation have already resulted in high levels of mortality and left many others so weakened that even with aid, high numbers of deaths will continue for months. This grim reality highlights why early intervention is so essential: Famine can still be slowed, but it should never be allowed to take hold in the first place.”"

There is no level 6.\nBut it took only moments for the Israeli government to respond in terms that were just as strident. The report dismissed as wholly inaccurate, based on biased, inaccurate data and influenced not by fact, but by the whims of Hamas.\nCOGAT, the Israeli agency that oversees humanitarian efforts in Gaza, claimed the IPC had ignored its data and presented a “one-sided report”, before claiming that “hundreds of truckloads of aid are still awaiting collection by the UN and international organisations”.\nWhat is so striking is that there is no grey area between these two versions.\nIn one, Israel has obstructed the delivery of aid and allowed hunger to turn into famine; in the other, it is Hamas that has caused the crisis by stealing aid and exploiting hunger as a political tool to try to win global sympathy.\nJournalists are not allowed to enter Gaza, so we are reliant on the work of colleagues who live there.\nBut the images are striking – emaciated people holding begging bowls, people scrambling towards aid drops or clambering over trucks carrying bags of flour. And all around them, shattered buildings.\nWe heard from a man in his 70s, who used to weigh 70kg, but who has lost almost half his body weight.\n“Now, because of malnutrition, my weight has dropped to just 40,” Hassan Abu Seble said. “I suffered both a stroke and a heart attack. They had to put in a stent to help me recover, and I thank God that my organs are still functioning.”\nThe Israeli government, and many across the country, will maintain that Hamas bears the responsibility for everything that has happened to Gazans – that it was the attack on 7 October, 2023, that was the sole precipitant for the suffering, death and hunger that has followed.\nBut from around much of the rest of the world, the condemnation is deafening, accusing Israel of allowing famine to fester.\nDavid Lammy, Britain’s foreign secretary, said the Israeli government had caused a “man-made famine” by blocking the distribution of aid, and described that as a “moral outrage”.\nThe question, as so often before, is what that rhetoric leads to. And, so long as the United States doesn’t join the chorus of disapproval, does widespread global disapproval mean anything?\nThere is also a question now of Gaza’s future.\nRead more from Sky News:\nIsrael to continue with Gaza City offensive\nFamine is our ‘worst fears being realised’\nAnalysis: Netanyahu has a decision to make\nIn the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City, we found a large sign that says “Make Gaza Jewish Again”. It is a slogan, and a sentiment, that is supported by plenty.\n“Yes, of course I agree,” says one man as he walks past, carrying a large pack of drinks. It turns out that he used to live in a Jewish settlement in Gaza until it was shut by the Israeli government two decades ago, but he has never stopped believing that Gaza is rightly Israel’s property.\n“The people there now – they should leave. They could go to Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt. It is our land. And yes, I would like to go back there.”\nHe did not believe there was a famine. “They have lots of food,” he told me.\nAnother man, Avraham, was more conciliatory, but insisted there had never been a country like Israel “that is fighting a war against a country but is also sending in so much humanitarian aid for the people”.\nGaza City is now the focal point of so much. Famine is spreading from this heart just as troops prepare to encircle the city. A ceasefire could come, but so could a huge military assault. And all the while, the hunger will get worse."

Katz wrote on social media that the “gates of hell” would soon open upon Hamas fighters if they did not comply, comparing Gaza’s potential fate to Rafah and Beit Hanoun, cities reduced to rubble in earlier Israeli offensives.\nThe declaration has triggered global outcry. UN Secretary-General António Guterres described the famine as a “man-made disaster” and a “failure of humanity,” demanding an immediate ceasefire and unhindered access for humanitarian aid.\nAid agencies and rights groups have long warned that food is being used as a weapon of war in Gaza, where more than 500 days of conflict and severe restrictions have left children and families starving. UN officials have cautioned that deliberately causing famine could constitute a war crime."

      "text": "ActionAid condemns deliberate starvation in Gaza as UN- backed experts confirm famine\nMonrovia, Liberia — The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has officially confirmed a state of famine in Gaza, a crisis that humanitarian organizations, including ActionAid Liberia, have warned was inevitable. The famine, classified as IPC Phase 5, has been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate and is projected to spread to the regions of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of September. This catastrophic situation is a direct result of the Israeli government’s prolonged blockade of lifesaving aid, which is considered a breach of international humanitarian law.\nOver 500,000 people are currently facing catastrophic conditions, including starvation and death. More than 1 million people, over half of Gaza’s population, are in a state of emergency (IPC Phase 4), and another 396,000 are in a crisis (IPC Phase 3). The deliberate obstruction of humanitarian convoys, closure of border crossings, and the weaponization of food and medical supplies have been denounced as collective punishment and a war crime under international law.\nThe consequences are dire and being felt by everyone. Mothers are being forced to feed their infants unsafe substitutes for milk, and children are dying from preventable causes.\n“There are mothers who resort to using legume water, herbs, and other alternatives to infant milk because of the severe shortage,” said Dr. Ra’ed Al-Baba of Al Awda Hospital. “These methods carry catastrophic risks, causing gastroenteritis, food poisoning, delayed growth, severe anemia, and even the inability to move. We have seen cases of extreme dehydration from polluted water mixed with these substitutes. This is not survival, this is slow death.”\nHumanitarian workers and their families are also affected. Faten, a senior project officer with WEFAQ, an ActionAid partner, described the personal toll. “In the past two months, I have lost 20 kilograms. My children have lost weight and are malnourished. We haven’t had proper meals for three days. I am exhausted, dizzy, and terrified my children will get sicker. I cry daily. This is the first time in my life I have wished I didn’t have children—because watching them waste away is unbearable.”\nActionAid is calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, the full and unfettered entry of humanitarian aid, and urgent international diplomatic pressure to ensure compliance with international law. The organization also demands an independent investigation into the causes of the famine and accountability for any violations of international law.\nJamil Sawalmeh, Country Director for ActionAid Palestine, warned that the famine is a man-made catastrophe. “The famine inside Gaza is a war crime,” he said. “It is a man-made catastrophe, driven by deliberate political decisions… I am sure we will hear words of condemnation across the world, but where is the action?”\nSawalmeh emphasized that the ongoing forced mass displacement, combined with the famine and weaponized aid, amounts to collective punishment. He stated that aid drops are merely a distraction and that the international community must take meaningful action to end the war and uphold international law.\nActionAid continues to work with its partners in Gaza to deliver whatever aid is possible under the current restrictions and stands ready to scale up operations if full access is granted.\nComments are closed."

      "text": "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has confirmed famine conditions in Gaza City and surrounding areas. This is the first time famine has been declared in the Middle East.\nThe IPC declares famine when three critical thresholds are met simultaneously:\n- Extreme food deprivation: At least 20% of households experience severe food shortages\n- Acute malnutrition: At least 30% of children under five suffer from acute malnutrition\n- Mortality rates: At least 2 deaths per 10,000 people daily (or 4 children per 10,000) due to starvation and related causes\nThe latest analysis confirms that all three criteria have been met in Gaza Governorate based on “reasonable evidence”.\nThe IPC report reveals that over 500,000 people in the Gaza Strip are currently experiencing “catastrophic conditions” characterized by starvation, destitution and death. This is nearly a quarter of Gaza’s 2.1 million population. Additionally, more than 1 million people face emergency levels of food insecurity, while approximately 396,000 are in crisis conditions.\nThe situation is projected to deteriorate further by the end of September, when famine is expected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. By that time, nearly one-third of Gaza’s population, approximately 641,000 people, will face catastrophic hunger conditions.\nMalnutrition rates among children have reached alarming levels, with nearly one in five children under five in Gaza City now acutely malnourished. Global Acute Malnutrition rates have tripled since June in Gaza City, doubled in Khan Younis and the Middle Area, making Gaza City the worst-hit area in the Strip.\nGaza City currently shows the most severe conditions, with 30% of residents experiencing catastrophic hunger and 50% in emergency conditions. The IPC was unable to classify North Gaza due to limited data access.\nThe death toll from malnutrition has surged dramatically. In July 2025 alone, 63 of the year’s 74 malnutrition-related deaths occurred, including 24 children under five. By August, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that at least 100 children have died from malnutrition and hunger since the conflict began. More recent reports indicate 227 total malnutrition-related deaths, including 103 children, as of August 2025.\nThe famine has been characterized by international experts as “entirely man-made” and attributable to four key factors: ongoing conflict, mass displacement, restricted humanitarian access, and the collapse of food systems.\nIsrael imposed a complete blockade on food and essential supplies from March to May 2025, creating what aid organizations describe as the longest interruption of humanitarian assistance since the conflict began. Even after the blockade was lifted, severe restrictions persist on aid deliveries.\nCurrent aid levels remain drastically insufficient. The World Food Programme calls for at least 100 trucks of aid daily to enter Gaza, but actual deliveries fall far short of this minimum requirement. Between July 27 and August, only approximately 1,334 aid trucks entered Gaza through all crossings—significantly below the 9,000 trucks that could have entered if 600 trucks per day had crossed as recommended by the United States.\nAid shipments face numerous obstacles, including rejection over minor packaging issues, extensive dual-use inspections, limited border crossing hours, and approval processes that now take “at least one month” compared to “a few days” during earlier ceasefires. Humanitarian workers report that aid is frequently turned back at borders, with supplies languishing in warehouses and on roadsides.\nIsrael has rejected the IPC findings, with the foreign ministry stating there is no famine in Gaza and dismissing the report as based on Hamas “lies.”\nGaza’s health infrastructure has been decimated, with only four specialized malnutrition treatment centers remaining operational and working beyond capacity. These facilities face fuel shortages and expect supplies to run out by mid-next month.\nOf the 234 nutrition centers that existed across Gaza, only 144 remain functional. In July alone, over 5,000 children under five were admitted for outpatient malnutrition treatment, with 18% suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition—the most life-threatening form.\nThe collapse of water and sanitation systems accelerates disease spread, creating a dangerous cycle of illness and death that compounds malnutrition. More than 1,060 people have been killed and 7,200 injured while trying to access food since May 27.\nWhile Gaza faces famine conditions, the West Bank also confronts escalating food insecurity. More than 40,000 people have been displaced since mid-January 2025 due to military operations dubbed “Iron Wall,” which began in refugee camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams."

      "text": "Philissa Cramer\nAn international hunger monitoring group says portions of Gaza now meet its standards for declaring a famine, crossing a threshold that it said had not previously been reached.\nThe declaration on Friday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system adds to a contested field of claims about hunger in Gaza, with pro-Palestinian voices warning for nearly the entire length of the Israel-Hamas war beginning in October 2023 that mass starvation was imminent and Israel and its defenders contending that sufficient aid has entered Gaza to sustain civilians, despite temporary blockades and rocky distribution efforts.\nThe IPC report says a recent increase in aid, which followed a widespread outcry about hunger in Gaza, is not enough to stem the crisis.\n“The complete halt of humanitarian and commercial food deliveries in March and April, followed by critically low volumes through July, coupled with the collapse of local food production has led to extreme food shortages,” the group said in its report. “While 55,600 metric tonnes of food entered Gaza in the first half of August, this remains largely insufficient to offset the prolonged deficits.”\nIsrael quickly rejected the determination. “If famine = falling prices + 300 daily aid trucks + open aid routes Gaza must be the first famine in history marked by abundance,” tweeted the Israeli office responsible for aid in Gaza, called Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories or COGAT. It alleged that the IPC had lowered its standards for declaring famine in order to smear Israel.\nThe IPC is a tool used by a consortium of food insecurity experts who monitor conditions around the world and advise the United Nations and other entities about what they learn. The report says the group’s conclusions about what is happening in Gaza were constrained by limited access and information about some portions of the enclave, home to about 2 million Palestinians.\nIts declaration applies to a region that includes Gaza City, which the Israeli army is preparing to enter. The group said other portions of Gaza still face widespread hunger challenges and are projected to enter famine conditions by the end of September.\nSome skeptics of claims about hunger in Gaza had cited the lack of an official declaration of famine as evidence that conditions were not as extreme as some claimed, and as viral photographs of emaciated children and lines at aid stations would seem to suggest.\nThe price of food staples in Gaza skyrocketed in recent months, offering evidence of scarcity, and President Donald Trump said he believed there was “real starvation” in the enclave, pressing Israeli officials to send more aid. Israel says the number of aid trucks entering Gaza has risen steadily.\nThis week, celebrity chef Jose Andres visited Israel and Gaza, where his World Central Kitchen nonprofit has distributed food for most of the war. He expressed sympathy for people on both sides of the conflict — and clarity about conditions in Gaza.\n“There is hunger in Gaza,” Andres told the Times of Israel. “I don’t know how much, but there is hunger in Gaza. And we need to make sure there’s no hunger in Gaza.”"

      "text": "The Looming Global Food Security Crisis: Gaza as a Harbinger of Systemic Collapse\nOver 579,000 people – more than half of Gaza’s population – are now experiencing ‘catastrophic’ levels of food insecurity, according to a recent UN-backed report. This isn’t simply a regional tragedy; it’s a stark warning signal about the fragility of global food systems and the escalating risk of widespread famine in a world increasingly vulnerable to climate change, conflict, and economic instability. The situation in Gaza, while uniquely dire, is a microcosm of a much larger, rapidly unfolding crisis.\nBeyond Gaza: A Cascade of Risk Factors\nThe reports emerging from Gaza – confirming famine conditions – are being met with dispute, particularly from Israel. However, the core issue transcends political debate. The underlying problem is a confluence of factors that are simultaneously impacting food production and distribution worldwide. These include prolonged droughts in key agricultural regions like the Horn of Africa, devastating floods in South America, and the ongoing disruption of supply chains due to geopolitical tensions. The war in Ukraine, for example, continues to impact global grain markets, and escalating conflicts in other regions threaten to exacerbate these disruptions.\nThe Climate-Conflict Nexus\nClimate change isn’t merely an environmental issue; it’s a threat multiplier. Increasingly frequent and severe weather events are destroying crops, displacing populations, and fueling conflict over dwindling resources. This creates a vicious cycle: conflict disrupts agricultural production, leading to food shortages, which in turn exacerbate existing tensions and increase the risk of further conflict. Gaza, already facing immense challenges, is particularly vulnerable to this nexus, but the pattern is repeating itself across the globe.\nThe Erosion of Humanitarian Access\nEven when food is available, getting it to those who need it most is becoming increasingly difficult. Humanitarian access is routinely blocked by conflict, bureaucratic obstacles, and a lack of political will. The situation in Gaza highlights the extreme consequences of this trend, with aid organizations struggling to deliver essential supplies amidst ongoing hostilities. This isn’t limited to conflict zones; increasingly restrictive immigration policies and border controls are also hindering the movement of agricultural workers, impacting food production in many countries.\nThe Rise of ‘Climate Refugees’ and Food-Driven Migration\nAs food insecurity worsens, we can expect to see a significant increase in climate-induced migration. People will be forced to leave their homes in search of food, water, and livelihoods, putting further strain on already overburdened resources in receiving countries. This mass displacement will not only create humanitarian crises but also fuel social and political instability. The scale of this migration could dwarf previous refugee flows, creating unprecedented challenges for international cooperation.\nThe Potential for Systemic Financial Contagion\nThe economic consequences of widespread famine and food insecurity are also significant. Food price spikes can trigger social unrest, destabilize governments, and disrupt global financial markets. A major food crisis could lead to a cascade of defaults and bankruptcies, particularly in countries heavily reliant on food imports. The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that a crisis in one region could quickly spread to others.\nFood security is no longer simply a matter of agricultural output; it’s a complex issue with far-reaching implications for global stability and human well-being.\n| Region | Projected Food Insecurity (2025) |\n|---|---|\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | +25% increase in acutely food insecure population |\n| Middle East & North Africa | +18% increase in acutely food insecure population |\n| South Asia | +12% increase in acutely food insecure population |\nPreparing for a Future of Scarcity\nAddressing this looming crisis requires a multifaceted approach. Investing in climate-resilient agriculture, strengthening supply chains, and promoting sustainable food systems are all essential. However, these measures alone will not be enough. We also need to address the underlying political and economic factors that contribute to food insecurity, including conflict, inequality, and a lack of access to resources. Furthermore, a fundamental shift in global priorities is needed, with greater emphasis placed on long-term sustainability and human well-being over short-term economic gains.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Global Food Security\nWhat role does technology play in addressing food insecurity?\nTechnology, including precision agriculture, vertical farming, and gene editing, offers promising solutions for increasing food production and improving crop resilience. However, these technologies must be accessible to all, not just wealthy nations and corporations.\nHow can individuals contribute to improving food security?\nIndividuals can reduce food waste, support local farmers, advocate for sustainable food policies, and make informed choices about their diets. Reducing meat consumption, for example, can significantly lower the environmental impact of food production.\nIs a global famine inevitable?\nA global famine is not inevitable, but the risk is increasing. Proactive measures, including increased investment in food security, conflict resolution, and climate adaptation, are crucial to averting a catastrophic outcome.\nThe situation in Gaza is a wake-up call. It’s a reminder that food security is not a given, and that the consequences of inaction could be devastating. The time to act is now, before the crisis spirals out of control and the world faces a future of widespread hunger and instability. What are your predictions for the future of global food security?

      "text": "FAO, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO reiterate call for immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access to curb deaths from hunger and malnutrition.\nReposted from World Health Organization, August 22, 2025\nMore than half a million people in Gaza are trapped in famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution, and preventable deaths, according to a new Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis released today. Famine conditions are projected to spread from Gaza Governorate to Deir Al Balah and Khan Younis Governorates in the coming weeks.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), UNICEF, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have collectively and consistently highlighted the extreme urgency for an immediate and full-scale humanitarian response given the escalating hunger-related deaths, rapidly worsening levels of acute malnutrition and plummeting levels of food consumption, with hundreds of thousands of people going days without anything to eat.\nThe agencies reinforced that famine must be stopped at all costs. An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict are critical to allow an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response that can save lives. The agencies are also gravely concerned about the threat of an intensified military offensive in Gaza City and any escalation in the conflict, as it would have further devastating consequences for civilians, where famine conditions already exist. Many people – especially sick and malnourished children, older people, and people with disabilities – may be unable to evacuate.\nBy the end of September, more than 640,000 people will face Catastrophic levels of food insecurity – classified as IPC Phase 5 – across the Gaza Strip. An additional 1.14 million people in the territory will be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and a further 396,000 people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) conditions. Conditions in North Gaza are estimated to be as severe – or worse – than in Gaza City. However, limited data prevented an IPC classification, highlighting the urgent need for access to assess and assist. Rafah was not analyzed, given indications that it is largely depopulated.\nClassifying famine means that the most extreme category is triggered when three critical thresholds – extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition, and starvation-related deaths – have been breached. The latest analysis now affirms on the basis of reasonable evidence, that these criteria have been met.\nAlmost two years of conflict, repeated displacement, and severe restrictions on humanitarian access, compounded by repeated interruptions and impediments to access to food, water, medical aid, support to agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, and the collapse of health, sanitation, and market systems, have pushed people into starvation.\nAccess to food in Gaza remains severely constrained. In July, the number of households reporting very severe hunger doubled across the territory compared to May and more than tripled in Gaza City. More than one in three people (39 percent) indicated they were going days at a time without eating, and adults regularly skip meals to feed their children.\nMalnutrition among children in Gaza is accelerating at a catastrophic pace. In July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year. Nearly one in four of these children was suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), the deadliest form with both short and long-term impacts.\nSince the last IPC Analysis in May, the number of children expected to be at severe risk of death from malnutrition by the end of June 2026 has tripled from 14,100 to 43,400. Similarly, for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the number of estimated cases has tripled from 17,000 in May to 55,000 women expected to be suffering from perilous levels of malnutrition by mid-2026. The impact is visible: one in five babies is born prematurely or underweight.\nThe new assessment reports the most severe deterioration since the IPC began analyzing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, and it marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region.\nSince July, food and aid supplies entering Gaza have increased slightly but remained vastly insufficient, inconsistent, and inaccessible compared to the need.\nMeanwhile, approximately 98 percent of cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible – decimating the agriculture sector and local food production – and nine of ten people have been serially displaced from homes. Cash is critically scarce, and aid operations remain severely disrupted, with most UN trucks looted amid growing desperation. Food prices are extremely high, and there is not enough fuel and water to cook and medicines, and medical supplies.\nGaza’s health system has severely deteriorated, access to safe drinking water and sanitation services has been drastically reduced, while multi-drug resistant infections are surging and levels of morbidity – including diarrhoea, fever, acute respiratory and skin infections – are alarmingly high among children.\nTo enable lifesaving humanitarian operations, the U.N. agencies emphasized the importance of an immediate and sustained ceasefire to stop the killing, allow for the safe release of hostages, and permit unimpeded access for a mass influx of assistance to reach people across Gaza. They stressed the urgent need for greater amounts of food aid, along with dramatically improved delivery, distribution, and accessibility, as well as shelter, fuel, cooking gas, and food production inputs. They emphasized that it is critical to support the rehabilitation of the health system, maintain and revive essential health services, including primary health care, and ensure sustained delivery of health supplies into and across Gaza. The restoration of commercial flows at scale, market systems, essential services, and local food production is also vital if the worst outcomes of the famine are to be avoided.\n“People in Gaza have exhausted every possible means of survival. Hunger and malnutrition are claiming lives every day, and the destruction of cropland, livestock, greenhouses, fisheries, and food production systems has made the situation even more dire,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. “Our priority must now be safe and sustained access for large-scale food assistance. Access to food is not a privilege – it is a basic human right.”\n“Famine warnings have been clear for months,” said Cindy McCain, WFP Executive Director. “What’s urgently needed now is a surge of aid, safer conditions, and proven distribution systems to reach those most in need – wherever they are. Full humanitarian access and a ceasefire now are critical to save lives.”\n“Famine is now a grim reality for children in Gaza Governorate, and a looming threat in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “As we have repeatedly warned, the signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat; babies dying from hunger and preventable disease; parents arriving at clinics with nothing left to feed their children. There is no time to lose. Without an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access, famine will spread, and more children will die. Children on the brink of starvation need the special therapeutic feeding that UNICEF provides.”\n“A ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine. Widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases like diarrhoea are becoming fatal, especially for children. The health system, run by hungry and exhausted health workers, cannot cope. Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines to save lives and begin the process of reversing malnutrition. Hospitals must be protected so that they can continue treating patients. Aid blockages must end, and peace must be restored, so that healing can begin.”\nAccess the IPC alert here.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is an innovative 21-partner initiative – made up of UN agencies and international NGOs – for improving food security and nutrition analysis and decision-making. By using the IPC classification and analytical approach, governments, UN Agencies, NGOs, civil society, and other relevant actors work together to determine the severity and magnitude of acute and chronic food insecurity and acute malnutrition situations in a country, according to internationally recognized scientific standards.

      "text": "A global hunger monitor confirmed on Friday that Gaza City and nearby areas are officially experiencing famine, warning it will likely spread—an assessment expected to intensify pressure on Israel to permit greater humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people – nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza – are experiencing famine, with the number due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City – known as Gaza governorate – which the IPC said was in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nIt was the first time the IPC had recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but said limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael dismissed the report as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\n“There is no famine in Gaza,” the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.\nExtreme Food Shortages\nFor a region to be classified as in a famine, at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nPreviously, the IPC has only registered famines in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the Gaza famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself”.\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\n“People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing … We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached “unimaginable levels”.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation and blamed Hamas for creating food shortages.\nIsrael Controls Gaza Access\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’ propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nThe U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify the North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data, and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region, as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC – an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organisations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nPast Famine Assessments Highlighted\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65% of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of U.S. public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict.\n(With inputs from Reuters)"

      "text": "The world’s leading authority on food crises has confirmed famine in Gaza City for the first time, warning that it is likely to spread to other parts of the territory unless there is a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said Friday that famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month. The IPC determination follows months of warnings by aid groups that Israel’s restrictions on food and aid, combined with ongoing military operations, were pushing civilians - particularly children - toward starvation.\nMore than 500,000 people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, are facing “starvation, destitution and death,” the IPC said, noting “catastrophic conditions” are spreading after 22 months of war. Hunger has been driven by fighting, blockade, widespread displacement, and the collapse of food production.\nThe IPC says famine is declared when at least 20% of households face extreme food shortages, 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and mortality reaches two adults or four children per 10,000 daily. Data from July to mid-August showed Gaza had already met thresholds for starvation and malnutrition.\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres called the crisis “a man-made disaster” and demanded unrestricted aid access.\nIsrael rejected the report. Its foreign ministry said “there is no famine in Gaza,” while COGAT, the Israeli military agency overseeing aid transfers, called the IPC findings “false and biased.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed reports of starvation as “lies” promoted by Hamas, though images of emaciated children and reports of hunger-related deaths have mounted.\nIsrael says it has taken steps to expand aid deliveries and insists there is no limit on the number of trucks entering Gaza. But UN agencies say what enters remains far below needs, with convoys hampered by Israeli restrictions, looting, and desperate crowds. Witnesses and health officials say hundreds of civilians have been killed while seeking aid; Israel disputes the toll, saying only warning shots were fired.\nDoctors in Gaza report increasing numbers of malnourished patients. Australian nurse Kirsty Blacka said emaciated men arrived at Al-Quds hospital “looking like teenagers because they were starving.”"

      "text": "Food security experts, who have been warning for 22 months of dire food shortages and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, on Friday confirmed that one part of the enclave is suffering from famine and that it is threatening to spread to others within weeks.\nThe confirmation of famine came from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, known as the IPC, a group of international organizations that collects and analyzes data about food security, to ensure that consistent criteria are used to assess food supplies and the conditions affecting them in different countries.\nIn July, experts warned of looming famine across Gaza. Israel restricted aid soon after the war began almost two years ago, but the situation was made significantly worse by a total Israeli blockade on food supplies for roughly 80 days between March and May.\nOn Friday, the IPC confirmed famine in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City and the surrounding area. It projected that famine could spread to south and central Gaza by the end of September.\nThe Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, an Israeli agency responsible for managing the entry of aid into Gaza, rejected the IPC's findings.\n\"The IPC report is based on partial and unreliable sources, many of them affiliated with Hamas, and blatantly ignores the facts and the extensive humanitarian efforts led by the state of Israel and its international partners,\" said Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, the head of the agency.\nHere's what to know about the IPC's report on famine in parts of Gaza.\nHow do experts define famine?\nThe IPC classifies famine in an area when at least 1 in 5 households face an extreme lack of food, a certain percentage of children are acutely malnourished, and two adults or four children for every 10,000 are dying each day \"due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\" According to the IPC, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing \"catastrophic conditions,\" classified at famine level and characterized by \"starvation, destitution and death.\" Twice as many, or about half of Gaza's population, are facing a state of emergency, the report said.\nHow is a famine officially declared?\nThe IPC collects data from aid groups and others on the ground and analyzes it to reach its conclusions, and the Famine Review Committee, an international panel of up to seven independent food security experts, reviews the findings.\nBut even if the IPC determines that a famine is unfolding, it cannot make an official declaration on its own.\nAccording to the IPC, its analyses allow governments, international and regional organizations, and humanitarian agencies to issue declarations of famine.\nIn 2022, Somalia's president expressed reluctance to declare a famine during a severe hunger crisis brought on by a drought. And in 2021, Ethiopia blocked a classification of famine in the Tigray region through heavy lobbying, according to a top United Nations official. In 2017, South Sudan officially declared a famine in parts of the nation.\nIt is unclear exactly what authority could or would declare a famine in Gaza. Hamas has long accused Israel of starving Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies that there is starvation in the enclave. The IPC's role is solely to analyze and classify data, not to decide who would issue a declaration.\nAid groups have long believed that an official declaration of famine can lead to more international attention, assistance and support, but some experts say there is little evidence for that claim.\nWhat does the report say is causing famine in Gaza?\nThe IPC said several factors had tipped Gaza's hunger crisis into famine: the intensifying conflict, strict Israeli restrictions on aid and frequent displacement of people. The cumulative effect \"has pushed Gaza into an unprecedented catastrophe,\" it said.\nNearly a third of Gaza's population is not eating for multiple days in a row, the U.N. World Food Program said in July, linking the extreme hunger to the blockade on food supplies Israel imposed this spring.\nIsrael has accused Hamas of looting aid. But the United Nations and some Israeli military officials have disputed the claim that U.N. aid was being systematically diverted by Hamas. Before March, food was distributed from hundreds of places across Gaza in a system facilitated by the U.N. In May, Israel partly lifted its blockade and set up a system run by American contractors and backed by the United States, saying it would ensure that aid goes to civilians.\nBut there are few locations and Palestinians must walk for miles to reach distribution spots near which Israeli soldiers stand watch. The U.N. human rights office has said hundreds of people have been killed, mostly by the Israeli military, in areas surrounding the distribution sites.\nUnder intense international pressure, Israel has allowed more aid to enter in recent weeks. Israeli officials have said roughly 300 trucks of relief supplies and commercial goods have been entering Gaza daily. And the cost of some food items in markets has fallen significantly, although they remain well above prewar prices.\nBut U.N. officials said many trucks were still being intercepted by desperate people and gunmen before reaching their destination.\nAre any other countries experiencing famine?\nIn June, the IPC said that parts of Sudan were experiencing famine and that the crisis could spread.\nAfghanistan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen were among the countries facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the 2025 Global Report on Food Crisis published by the European Union-funded Food Security Information Network, based on data from the previous year.\nThe IPC has classified famine in Somalia in 2011; in South Sudan in 2017; and in Sudan in 2024, which is ongoing.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

      "text": "UN Declares Full-Blown Famine in Gaza Despite Israeli Denials\nThe UN declares full-blown famine in Gaza, warning that more than half a million Palestinians are enduring catastrophic conditions marked by starvation, destitution, and death. The announcement underscores the gravity of the humanitarian crisis as relentless Israeli attacks continue to worsen the plight of civilians.\nAccording to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the UN-backed system for measuring access to food, Gaza has officially entered famine conditions. This is the most severe level of food insecurity, defined by widespread hunger, malnutrition, and the likelihood of mass casualties if immediate relief is not provided.\nUN officials said that over 500,000 Palestinians are now trapped in situations where food is almost non-existent. Many families are surviving on minimal supplies, relying on unsafe water and consuming leaves or animal feed to endure the crisis.\nA UN humanitarian coordinator described the situation as “a man-made disaster,” emphasizing that the collapse of essential services, combined with the blockade and ongoing military operations, has cut off ordinary Gazans from food and medical aid.\nRead more: China-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue: Wang Yi Meets COAS Asim Munir in Islamabad\nFamine declared by IPC in #Gaza Governorate is a direct result of actions by #Israel‘s Government that has unlawfully restricted entry & distribution of humanitarian aid.\nIt is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to a… pic.twitter.com/knqnRpe2yH\n— UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) August 22, 2025\nIsrael Rejects UN Famine Classification\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry strongly rejected the UN findings, calling them baseless and politically motivated. A ministry spokesperson claimed there is “no famine in Gaza,” dismissing the IPC report as propaganda influenced by Hamas.\nThe Israeli government argued that aid continues to enter Gaza and accused international organizations of failing to hold Hamas responsible for controlling supplies. Officials said they would continue their military operations in Gaza City despite growing global criticism of the humanitarian toll.\nThis rejection adds to the deepening dispute between Israel and international bodies over the handling of the crisis, with the UN maintaining that restrictions on aid deliveries and destruction of infrastructure have fueled famine-like conditions.\nRising Death Toll in Gaza\nWhile food insecurity worsens, the violence on the ground continues. Palestinian hospital sources told Al Jazeera that 47 people were killed in Gaza since dawn on Friday due to Israeli strikes.\nThe majority of these deaths, at least 31, occurred in Gaza City, where Israeli forces have intensified operations in an attempt to seize control of the largest urban centre in the enclave. Witnesses reported heavy bombardments and street battles that forced families to flee their homes.\nMedical staff said five of the victims were civilians who had gathered in hopes of receiving aid. This highlights the deadly intersection of hunger and violence, as desperate Gazans risk their lives in search of food and relief.\nHumanitarian Catastrophe\nThe declaration of famine underscores the urgent need for international intervention. Aid groups warn that without immediate, large-scale humanitarian assistance, the death toll from starvation could quickly surpass those caused by military action.\nChildren are bearing the heaviest burden. Malnutrition rates among Gaza’s youngest have skyrocketed, with reports of infants dying from hunger-related complications. Health workers say hospitals, already overwhelmed by war casualties, are unable to treat the surge in hunger-related illnesses due to shortages of medicine, fuel, and electricity.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has called for unrestricted access to Gaza, stressing that trucks carrying food supplies are often delayed or denied entry. Aid convoys that do reach the enclave face dangerous conditions, with several recent incidents of vehicles being struck during military operations.\nCalls for Ceasefire and Aid\nThe UN and humanitarian organizations continue to push for an immediate ceasefire to allow safe passage for aid. Officials argue that without halting the conflict, efforts to tackle famine will remain ineffective.\nDiplomatic efforts are intensifying, but divisions within the international community persist. While some countries have backed UN appeals for urgent action, others continue to support Israel’s right to conduct military operations, complicating consensus on how to respond to the worsening crisis.\nA Growing Global Concern\nThe UN declaration of famine in Gaza is not only a humanitarian alarm but also a geopolitical challenge. The crisis has sparked widespread protests in several countries, with activists demanding an end to the blockade and urging governments to pressure Israel into allowing full-scale humanitarian relief.\nAs the situation deteriorates, aid workers warn that Gaza risks becoming a “graveyard for children” unless immediate action is taken. The combination of famine and ongoing bombardments has created what the UN describes as one of the most severe humanitarian crises of the century.\nFollow us on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook,, X and TikTok for latest updates"

      "text": "Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine, and it will likely spread, a global hunger monitor determined on Friday, an assessment that will escalate pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people – nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza – are experiencing famine, with the number due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City – known as Gaza governorate – which the IPC said was in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nIt was the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but said limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael dismissed the report as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\n“There is no famine in Gaza,” the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nPreviously, the IPC has only registered famines in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the Gaza famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself”.\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\n“People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing … We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached “unimaginable levels”.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation and blamed Hamas for creating food shortages.\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’ propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nThe U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC – an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organizations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65% of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of U.S. public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict.

      "text": "Famine in Gaza: ‘A failure of humanity itself’, says UN chief\nMore than half a million people in Gaza are trapped in famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths, according to a new UN-backed food security report released on Friday.\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said the results of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis were no mystery: “It is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment – and a failure of humanity itself.\n“Famine is not about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival.”\nFamine conditions are projected to spread from Gaza Governorate to Deir Al Balah and Khan Younis Governorates in the coming weeks, the IPC estimates.\nUN agencies have collectively and consistently highlighted the extreme urgency of delivering immediate and full-scale humanitarian aid given the escalating hunger-related deaths, rapidly worsening levels of acute malnutrition and plummeting levels of food consumption in Gaza – with hundreds of thousands going days without anything to eat.\nIsrael’s obligations\n“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population,” said the UN chief, reacting to the famine declaration from the IPC, which is endorsed by dozens of governments, UN agencies and NGOs as the key evidence-based measure of food insecurity and malnutrition.\nSee our UN News explainer here.\nMr. Guterres said Israel’s denial of its duties could not be allowed to continue: “No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow – it is now.”\nSilence the guns, release the hostages\nUN agencies operating in Gaza joined the UN chief in calling for an immediate ceasefire to finally allow unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response and the immediate release of all hostages taken by Hamas and other militants during the 7 October 2023 terror attacks.\nAgencies also expressed grave concern over the threat of the intensified military offensive on Gaza City and any further escalation in the conflict, as it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist.\n“Many people – especially sick and malnourished children, older people and people with disabilities – may be unable to evacuate,” they said in a joint statement.\nFamine set to expand\nBy the end of September, more than 640,000 people will face 'catastrophic' levels of food insecurity – classified as IPC Phase 5 – across the Gaza Strip.\nAn additional 1.14 million people in the enclave will be in phase 4 with a further 396,000 people facing phase 3 'crisis' conditions.\nConditions in North Gaza are estimated to be as severe – or worse – than in Gaza City. However, limited data prevented an IPC classification, highlighting the urgent need for access.\nClassifying famine means that the most extreme category is triggered when three critical thresholds – extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition and starvation-related deaths – have been breached. The latest analysis now affirms on the basis of reasonable evidence that these criteria have been met, UN agencies said.\nBriefing journalists on Friday at UN headquarters in Geneva, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said it was a famine that could have been prevented “if we had been allowed.”\nFamine in a fertile land\n“Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel. It is a famine within a few hundred metres of food, in a fertile land.\nIt is a famine that we repeatedly warned of – but that the international media has not been allowed in to cover, to bear witness,” he added.\n“It is a famine in 2025. A 21st century famine watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history. It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war.”\nOn a wider scale, Mr. Fletcher said it was “the world’s famine. It is a famine that asks ‘but what did you do?’ A famine that will and must haunt us all.”\nMalnutrition among children in Gaza is accelerating “at a catastrophic pace”, said UN agencies, who note that in July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year.\nPossible war crime\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said the famine was the “direct result” of Israeli Government policies.\n“It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing,” he said.\n“Israeli authorities must take immediate steps to end the famine in the Gaza Governorate and prevent further loss of life across the Gaza strip. They must ensure immediate entry of humanitarian assistance in sufficient amounts, and full access to UN and other humanitarian organizations.”\nFirst Middle East famine\nSince the last IPC Analysis in May, the number of children expected to be at severe risk of death from malnutrition by the end of June 2026 has tripled from 14,100 to 43,400.\nThe new assessment reports the most severe deterioration since the IPC began analysing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in Gaza Strip, and it marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region.\nSince July, food and aid supplies entering Gaza increased slightly but remained vastly insufficient, inconsistent and inaccessible compared to the need.\nMeanwhile, approximately 98 percent of cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible – decimating the agriculture sector and local food production – and nine of ten people have been serially displaced from homes."

      "text": "Gaza famine deepens while the world watches in silence\nGaza is being pushed into famine by Israel’s deliberate blockade of food and humanitarian aid, leaving thousands of Palestinian children on the edge of starvation.\nInternational aid agencies and UN officials warn that Gaza’s hunger crisis has reached catastrophic levels, describing it as one of the worst humanitarian disasters of our time.\nFor months, Israel has restricted the entry of vital food supplies, including fortified milk and therapeutic nutrition needed to save starving children. Although Tel Aviv claims it has loosened the blockade, the limited trickle of aid is nowhere near enough to feed Gaza’s population of over two million, who have been under siege since October 2023.\nAccording to Gaza’s Health Ministry, deaths from malnutrition are rising sharply. In just the first 20 days of August, 133 Palestinians died from hunger, including 25 children. These figures were verified by the World Health Organization, yet Israel continues to deny that famine exists in Gaza, dismissing reports of mass starvation as “medical complications.”\nThe United Nations, however, has accused Israel of weaponising food against civilians — a war crime under international law. Rights groups have also documented Israeli forces shooting Palestinians as they tried to collect aid.\nInside Gaza’s shattered hospitals, doctors describe heartbreaking scenes. Infants arrive emaciated, too weak to cry. Mothers, themselves starving, cannot produce milk to feed their babies. At Rantisi Hospital in Gaza City, a doctor displayed a skeletal infant whose life depends on a therapeutic formula that is almost impossible to obtain.\nSome mothers have been forced to feed their children with herbs and wild plants. “There was no milk,” said Aisha Wahdan, a young mother. “I tried chamomile and thyme, anything I could find. My baby was dying.”\nThree-month-old Kholoud al-Aqra weighs only two kilograms — barely a third of a healthy child’s weight. Her mother survives on a single bowl of soup some days and says she nearly faints while breastfeeding. Aid workers warn that without immediate therapeutic foods, thousands of babies like Kholoud will die in the coming weeks.\nAgriculture and fishing, once Gaza’s main food sources, have been destroyed by Israeli bombardments, leaving Palestinians almost entirely dependent on imports. But Israel continues to strangle those imports, allowing only limited amounts of aid while blaming the UN and local authorities for distribution problems.\nThe reality is undeniable: hunger is being used as a weapon. Aid agencies report that of the 290,000 children under five who urgently need supplements, only 3% received them last month. UNICEF says it has almost no supplies left, while the World Food Programme has warned of a “preventable mass death” if aid is not allowed to flow freely.\nDespite the suffering, Gaza’s people remain steadfast. “Hamas is keen more than anyone else for aid to reach our people,” said Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of Gaza’s media office, rejecting Israel’s propaganda that aid is being “stolen.”\nThe world has already witnessed the images: starving children, desperate parents, and long lines at destroyed bakeries. What is happening in Gaza is not a natural famine — it is a man-made catastrophe imposed by Israel’s blockade and war.\nFor Libya, and for the Arab world, the message is clear: silence in the face of starvation is complicity. The children of Gaza are not numbers in a report — they are the sons and daughters of Palestine, and they are being starved before the eyes of the world.\nHow to submit an Op-Ed: Libyan Express accepts opinion articles on a wide range of topics.

      "text": "Despite international pleas and condemnations, Israel continues to restrict food imports and distribution.\n(Washington, D.C., August 22, 2025) —The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a consortium of UN and international health organizations, concluded today that the Gaza Governorate of the Gaza Strip is currently experiencing Phase 5 famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity Scale. The IPC projected that famine would expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis within weeks.\n\"The international community has an urgent legal and moral duty to stop Israel's deliberate starvation of Palestinians, which has now officially created a famine in Gaza,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of DAWN. \"While the world dithers, Israel is making plans to slaughter or displace those Palestinians still managing to stay alive.\"\nAccording to the IPC, a Phase 5 famine classification exists \"when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 dying each day due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\"\nIn July 2025, DAWN urged the UN Secretary General to secure an official declaration of famine in Gaza by U.N. agencies in light of the escalating death of Palestinians due to hunger caused by Israel's deliberate starvation policy.\n\"Famine in Gaza is not inevitable — it is the result of deliberate obstruction of life-saving aid,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at DAWN. \"States must force Israel to allow immediate, large-scale, and unhindered humanitarian assistance into Gaza now, and restore commercial flows, markets, essential services, and local food production at scale to stop the mass starvation and death unfolding before our eyes.\"\nIn 2024, the International Criminal Court charged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant with the war crime of using starvation as a weapon of war, among other violations of the Rome Statute, and issued arrest warrants against them. The prosecutor found that Netanyahu and other Israeli officials intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of essentials for survival, such as food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity, between October 8, 2023, and May 20, 2024.\n\"It has been nearly two years since the Israeli defense minister openly announced Israel's intention to starve the people of Gaza,\" said Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, Israel-Palestine director at DAWN. \"The international community has stood by and passively watched as Israel starves an entire population in slow motion.\""

      "text": "SENIOR UN officials have warned that Israel’s genocide and blockade of Gaza have created a man-made famine that is escalating at terrifying speed, with child malnutrition tripling in less than six months.\nPhilippe Lazzarini, Commissioner General of UNRWA, said on Wednesday that nearly 100,000 children under the age of five have been screened since March, revealing ‘alarming’ results.\nIn Gaza City, one in three children is now malnourished which is six times higher than before the collapse of the March ceasefire.\n‘This is not a natural disaster,’ Lazzarini stressed.\n‘This is a man-made famine, and one that is preventable.’\nThe Gaza Health Ministry reported on Thursday that 271 Palestinians, including 112 children, have died from starvation since October 7th, 2023.\nThe deaths are the direct result of Israel’s policy of blocking aid convoys and cutting off food, medicine, and fuel.\nAccording to UNRWA, aid warehouses in Egypt and Jordan contain enough supplies for 6,000 truckloads, which could sustain the population for three months, but Israel continues to deny them entry.\nGaza’s Government Media Office says that 1.2 million children are now suffering acute food insecurity.\nAdnan Abu Hasna, media adviser to UNRWA, said the situation is nothing short of catastrophic.\n‘What we are witnessing is an unprecedented humanitarian tsunami,’ he told reporters.\nHe explained that Israel maintains direct military control or evacuation orders over 86 per cent of Gaza, making vast areas uninhabitable and leaving the occupying power fully responsible under international law for the survival of more than two million people.\nHe warned that attempts to force Palestinians into displacement or southward relocation constitute flagrant violations of the Geneva Conventions and the UN Charter.\nAbu Hasna further accused Israel of trying to dismantle UNRWA itself as part of a wider strategy to erase the Palestinian refugee issue and prevent any chance of a political settlement.\nDespite attacks on its operations, the agency continues to deliver services: Between March and July, UNRWA provided medical care to nearly 1.5 million patients – averaging 18,000 per day – while also supplying water, shelter, psychological support, and waste collection under dire conditions.\n‘What we are doing now is not about improving quality of life,’ Abu Hasna said.\n‘It is about keeping people alive in their homeland.’\nInternational organisations continue to warn that Gaza’s health and nutrition crisis is spiralling, with children suffering the harshest consequences of Israel’s deliberate starvation policy.\n• See editorial"

This is a moral outrage.\nThe IPC report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children. The Government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those who so desperately need them.\nThe Israeli government must allow the UN and international NGOs to carry out their life-saving work without obstruction. Aid must reach those in need urgently and without delay.\nWe desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine.\nThe UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the hostages held by Hamas. We urge the Israeli government to change course and halt its plans.\nThis terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace.\nMedia enquiries\nEmail newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk\nTelephone 020 7008 3100\nEmail the FCDO Newsdesk (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first instance, and we will respond as soon as possible."
