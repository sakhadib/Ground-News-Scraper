      "text": "European postal services suspend shipment of packages to US over tariffs\nATHENS, Greece — The end of an exemption on tariff duties for low-value packages coming into the United States is causing multiple international postal services to pause shipping as they await more clarity on the rule.\nThe exemption, known as the “ de minimis” exemption, allows packages worth less than $800 to come into the US duty free. A total of 1.36 billion packages were sent in 2024 under this exemption, for goods worth $64.6 billion, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency.\nREAD: US to tighten trade rules to hit low-cost China shipments\nIt is set to expire on Friday. On Saturday, postal services around Europe announced that they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid confusion over new import duties.\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they will stop shipping most merchandise to the US effective immediately. France and Austria will follow on Monday.\nThe United Kingdom’s Royal Mail said it would halt shipments to the US on Tuesday to allow time for those packages to arrive before duties kick in. Items originating in the United Kingdom worth over $100 — including gifts to friends and family — will incur a 10-percent duty, it said.\nKey questions\n“Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the US Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,” DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said in a statement.\nThe company said starting Saturday it “will no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US.”\nA trade framework agreed on by the US and the European Union last month set a 15-percent tariff on the vast majority of products shipped from the EU. Packages under $800 will now also be subject to the tariff.\nThe US duty-free exemption for goods originating from China ended in May as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value Chinese goods. The exemption is being extended to shipments from around the world.\nMany European postal services say they are pausing deliveries now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before Aug. 29. They cite ambiguity about what kind of goods are covered by the new rules, and the lack of time to process their implications.\nSuspensions\nPostnord, the Nordic logistics company, and Italy’s postal service announced similar suspensions effective Saturday.\n“In the absence of different instructions from US authorities … Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted,” Poste Italiane said Friday.\nShipping by services such as DHL Express remains possible, it added.\nBjörn Bergman, head of PostNord’s Group Brand and Communication, said the pause was “unfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules.”\nIn the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the Trump administration is pressing ahead with the new duties despite U.S. authorities lacking a system to collect them. He said that PostNL is working closely with its U.S. counterparts to find a solution.\nCommercial shipments\n“If you have something to send to America, you should do it today,” Witteveen told The Associated Press.\nAustrian Post, Austria’s leading logistics and postal service provider, stated that the last acceptance of commercial shipments to the US, including Puerto Rico, will take place Tuesday.\nFrance’s national postal service, La Poste, said the US did not provide full details or allow enough time for the French postal service to prepare for new customs procedures.\n″Despite discussions with US customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,″ it said in a statement.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no solution can be found by Aug. 29 all its members will likely follow suit."

      "text": "Consumers Expecting Packages From Businesses Overseas May Face Delays as Postal Services Shut Down Shipments Ahead of New Tariffs\nThe end of the de minimis exemption means products under $800 will be subject to new duties, though shippers have yet to figure out the mechanics for paying the new fees.\nDirect-to-consumer shipments from overseas will beginning Friday be subject to new taxes on deliveries valued under $800, an end to a loophole in tariff policy that has led dozens of international postal services to announce they will suspend shipments to America.\nPostal services in Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Greece, Malta, Liechtenstein, India, Singapore, and Thailand all announced a pause in shipments, saying they did not receive technical guidance until last week for the Friday deadline and are unprepared for the paperwork. The 51-member Association of European Postal Services, PostEurop said it will shut down shipments until member nations can sort out the details.\n“PostEurop members are working very hard on solutions to ensure that postal goods shipping to the USA can continue for both business and private customers, considering also the importance of guaranteeing the Universal Postal Service,” the association said in a statement about the impending duty.\nPostal shipment rates were set up to be charged at a flat rate based of the value of the shipped items until February, when the country of origin’s prevailing tariff rate would be imposed. For postal services in national with a 15 percent or lower tariff rate, that would mean shipments incur an $80 flat fee. From 16-25 percent, the rate will be $160 while shippers in nations with tax rates over 25 percent will pay the postal service $200 per shipment.\nNon-postal shipments—items sent through FedEx and other international shipping services—will be subject to the tariff rate of the country of origin. Customs and Border Patrol will manage the documentation. Companies that try to evade the rate could face first-time penalties of $5,000.\nDHL paused its intake of goods from business customers shipping to America on Friday. “Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,” reads a press statement issued by the organization.\nThe de minimis tax was an exemption to taxes on low-priced goods permitted by Congress as far back as the 1930s but raised to values of $800 during the Obama administration. The exemption will still be permitted for items shipped from Communist China and Hong Kong, per an executive order earlier this month that President Trump said he approved while trade negotiations are ongoing. Mexico and Canada were also exempted for now, though the Big Beautiful Bill signed by the president in July eliminates any exemptions beginning in July 2027.\nWith the suspension of the de minimis tax and a variety of different tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration, tax rates could vary greatly country by country, just as sales tax varies state by state. ECommerce shipping company, Easyship, offered several examples of how prices may be affected.\n“Example: A seller in Vietnam shipping $20 phone cases may now face $80–$200 in duties per order under new IEEPA tariffs,” the company noted in a message to its users. For companies paying to ship apparel, beauty products, accessories, games, and tech items, a single $45 item from a country with a 15 percent tariff rate would now cost $55.50, assuming the cost is passed onto the consumer.\nEasyship suggested getting around the excessive individual shipping costs by mass-mailing products to freight partners in fulfillment centers inside America.\nIn May, China’s largest clothing manufacturer, Temu, announced it was no longer shipping clothes to America from China. Instead, it began stockpiling products in American warehouses and using American suppliers to send packages within U.S. borders. It still lost about a third of its merchants operating in America. However, Temu rebounded in July after the exemption from the de minimis suspension and is reportedly expected to recover 80-90 percent of its operations by September."

tax deal scrapped\nSign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Get our free Inside Washington email Several countries are suspending postal service to the United States as the exemption on tariff duties for low-cost packages comes to an end following an executive order from Donald Trump.\nPostal services for several European countries said they are putting a pause on shipping packages to the U.S. the “de minimis” exemption expires on Friday, August 29.\nThe exemption allows packages worth less than $800 to enter the country duty-free. In 2024, 1.36 billion packages entered the country under the exemption, bringing in goods worth $64.6 billion total, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data.\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they would halt shipping most packages to the United States on Saturday. France and Austria said they will stop on Monday.\nThe United Kingdom’s Royal Mail said it would stop shipments on Tuesday, allowing time for those packages to arrive before duties begin.\nopen image in gallery\nSeveral countries are suspending postal service to the U.S. as the exemption on tariff duties for low-cost packages ends Friday. (Getty Images) Now, items being shipped from the U.K. worth more than $100 — including gifts and packages being sent to friends and family — will incur a 10 percent duty, the Royal Mail said.\nRemoving the exemption raises costs for imported goods, but postal companies say they’re taking a pause due to the ambiguous policies the Trump administration is putting into place.\n“Key questions remain unresolved,” including how duties are collected, what additional data will be required, and how that data will be reported to customs officials, according to DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe.\nStarting Saturday, DHL said it would “no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers” destined for the United States.\nAsian postal services, including SingPost and India’s Department of Posts, also announced plans to halt shipments to the U.S.\nThe Trump administration revoked the exception for China and Hong Kong in May, impacting popular cheap retailers such as Temu and Shein , before deciding last month that the change would be extended to shipments coming into the United States from all countries.\nBusinesses may face an $80 per item charge for packages sent from countries with a tariff rate less than 16 percent. Parcels sent from countries with a tariff rate between 16 percent and 25 percent may see costs as high as $160.\nCountries with tariff rates above 25 percent would see a $200 per item fee incurred, according to Trump’s executive order.\nThe changes would force either the sender or consumer to take on the new fees, according to Belgium’s bpost , which said in a statement the changes mean “import duties for all shipments with goods must be prepaid, regardless of value.”\nopen image in gallery\nDHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said it would ‘no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US’ (Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images) Letters sent to the United States — or packages sent by individuals worth less than $100 — will not be affected.\nThe de minimis provision was added several years after the passage of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the intention of making trade easier by eliminating administrative hurdles, such as collecting minimal duties. It has been particularly effective with the rise of e-commerce .\nHowever, in recent years, cheap e-commerce retailers overseas have been accused of over-utilizing the loophole, with the White House calling di minimis a “catastrophic loophole” used to funnel synthetic drugs into the country.\nMany European countries enacting restrictions now say they are taking action early because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the country before Friday.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal companies, says if no solution is found before then, all members will likely pause shipments to the United States.\nWith reporting by the Associated Press\nThank you for registering Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in Please refresh your browser to be logged in\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "President Trump’s executive order that suspends the import tax exemption on incoming low-value parcels for all countries could be forcing European and global postal services to suspend deliveries to the US starting August 29.\nThe Hellenic Post (ELTA) is among the affected carriers already warning their customers on the latest development. “If no solutions are established before the regulation takes effect on 29 August 2025, Hellenic Post—like other European postal services—may be forced to temporarily suspend the shipment of goods to the United States through postal networks,” ELTA said in an announcement released on Friday.\n“Hellenic Post, alongside other European postal operators, is feverishly working to develop solutions that will allow both business and individual customers of Hellenic Post to continue shipping their goods to the United States, in accordance with the new customs requirements,” it concluded.\nGlobal postal services affected by new US regulations for incoming low-value parcels\nCurrently, low value goods and gifts can be imported into the US duty-free from other countries due to a de minimis customs threshold of $800. Effective August 29, 2025, items and goods valued below this threshold that were previously exempt from duties will now be subject to duties from the very first dollar. These duties must be paid to US Customs before goods enter the country.\nThe executive order that leaves the shipment of global low-value parcels to the US in limbo was signed on July 30, introducing “new regulations which follow a different approach from those provided globally by the Universal Postal Union,” according to PostEurope, the association representing 51 European postal operators responsible for providing the Universal Postal Service.\n“This measure will significantly affect all postal companies worldwide and their customers sending shipments through postal networks to the United States Postal Service (USPS),” PostEurope, in which ELTA is also a member, warned in an announcement.\n“Critical issues and processes, such as customs duties collection, the data to be collected, and the interaction with the US Customs and Border Protection, are not yet clearly defined. Select technical details were only released on 15 August, leaving an extremely short timeframe to prepare,” the association describes.\nIf those critical issues and processes are not defined and, thus, compliant solutions cannot be found before the regulations take effect on August 29, PostEurop Members, in alignment with the competent National Authorities, may be constrained to temporarily restrict or suspend the shipping of goods via the postal networks to the USA.\nEuropean carriers already not accepting parcels to the US\nSome carriers have already stopped accepting parcels to the US. Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany has temporarily suspended the acceptance and transport of business customer parcels via the postal network to the US since August 22.\nShipping via DHL Express remains possible, while packages and parcels that contain only gifts from individuals to individuals with a value of up to $100 and are declared as “gift,” as well as documents, can continue to be sent as usual.\nThis also applies to the postal service of the Czech Republic, which warns of longer delivery times even for the above exemptions. Malta’s postal services suspended the acceptance of parcels to the US on Saturday, and for the Spanish postal service, the suspension will go into effect from Monday.\nIn some cases, such as Liechtenstein, postal services won’t even accept documents and letters for shipment to the US.\nSee all the latest news from Greece and the world at Greekreporter.com.

      "text": "New Delhi: Much like postal operators in Europe, India Post too on Saturday (August 23) announced that it will temporarily suspend all parcel services to the US from August 25, due to confusion over new American import duties.The suspension of parcel services will affect all parcels irrespective of value. As a result, only letters, documents and gift items worth up to $100 will continue to be accepted for delivery to the US, reported Hindustan Times.The disruption in the parcel service results from the Donald Trump administration’s decision last month to scrap the global “de minimis” rule, which earlier allowed goods valued under $800 to enter America with minimal paperwork.The change, which will be effective from August 29, means that every parcel entering the US will now attract customs duties. As per an executive order issued on July 30, the only exception will be small gifts under $100.“We don’t have any agreement with any agency who can accept, collect the duty and pay it. Airlines have also not agreed, and the ‘qualified parties’ that the US government talks about have not yet been finalised,” said L.K. Dash, deputy director general (international relations and global business), department of posts, reported Hindustan Times.While the US executive order says that airlines or other approved agencies are required to collect and pay customs duties on parcels, the authorities have not yet explained who these agencies will be or how the duty collection system will function.The HT report said that the disruption will affect trade flows significantly because India Post normally sends an average of 3 tonne of cargo daily to the US, totalling 100 to 200 tonnes monthly. India Post has reached out to US Customs and Border Protection and flagged the matter to the ministry of commerce and ministry of external affairs who handle counterpart discussions with American authorities.“This will be a major impact on exports. Until we tide over the issues, businesses and individuals will be badly hit. We have no idea how long this will last,” said Dash."

      "text": "The end of an exemption on tariff duties for low-value packages coming into the United States is causing multiple international postal services to pause shipping as they await more clarity on the rule.\nThe exemption, known as the “de minimis” exemption, allows packages worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty free. A total of 1.36 billion packages were sent in 2024 under this exemption, for goods worth $64.6 billion, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Agency.\nIt is set to expire on Friday. On Saturday, postal services around Europe announced that they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid confusion over new import duties.\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they will stop shipping most merchandise to the U.S. effective immediately. France and Austria will follow on Monday.\nThe U.K.’s Royal Mail said it would halt shipments to the U.S. on Tuesday to allow time for those packages to arrive before duties kick in. Items originating in the United Kingdom worth over $100 — including gifts to friends and family — will incur a 10% duty, it said.\n“Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,” DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said in a statement.\nThe company said starting Saturday it “will no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US.”\nA trade framework agreed on by the U.S. and the European Union last month set a 15% tariff on the vast majority of products shipped from the EU. Packages under $800 will now also be subject to the tariff.\nThe U.S. duty-free exemption for goods originating from China ended in May as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value Chinese goods. The exemption is being extended to shipments from around the world.\nMany European postal services say they are pausing deliveries now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before Aug. 29. They cite ambiguity about what kind of goods are covered by the new rules, and the lack of time to process their implications.\nPostnord, the Nordic logistics company, and Italy’s postal service announced similar suspensions effective Saturday.\n“In the absence of different instructions from US authorities … Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted,” Poste Italiane said Friday.\nShipping by services such as DHL Express remains possible, it added.\nBjörn Bergman, head of PostNord’s Group Brand and Communication, said the pause was “unfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules.”\nIn the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the Trump administration is pressing ahead with the new duties despite U.S. authorities lacking a system to collect them. He said that PostNL is working closely with its U.S. counterparts to find a solution.\n“If you have something to send to America, you should do it today,” Witteveen told The Associated Press.\nAustrian Post, Austria’s leading logistics and postal service provider, stated that the last acceptance of commercial shipments to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, will take place Tuesday.\nFrance’s national postal service, La Poste, said the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time for the French postal service to prepare for new customs procedures.\n″Despite discussions with U.S. customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,″ it said in a statement.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no solution can be found by Aug. 29 all its members will likely follow suit."

Shipments via DHL Express are not affected.\nPresident Donald Trump in July signed an executive order that ended the de minimis tariff exemption for low-value shipments from all nations to the United States as of Friday.\n\"Many shippers go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and hide illicit substances in imports that go through international commerce,\" Trump said in the July 30 executive order ending the tariff exemption.\n\"Some of the techniques employed by these shippers to conceal the true contents of shipments, the identity of the distributors and the country of origin of the imports include the use of re-shippers in the United States, false invoices, fraudulent postage and deceptive packaging,\" Trump said.\nHe said the \"risks of evasion, deception and illicit drug importation\" are especially high for \"low-value articles\" that were subject to the duty-free exemption.\nThe de minimis exemption eliminated tariffs on goods valued at $800 or less when shipped or mailed to the United States.\nTrump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to eliminate the tariff exemption, which enabled overseas interests to avoid tariffs and smuggle deadly substances, like fentanyl, into the United States, the DHS announced on July 31.\nCongress in the 1930s passed the de minimis exemption amid the Great Depression and amended it several times afterward.\nDe minimis is a Latin term that means something is too insignificant for consideration, and the exempted amount was $200 for many years.\nThe Obama administration in 2016 increased the exempted amount from $200 to $800 to improve economic activity."

      "text": "🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nPostal services across Europe are suspending shipments to the United States as a duty-free exemption for low-value packages is set to expire next week.\nA spokesperson for the USPS declined to add further comment when contacted by Newsweek on Saturday.\nWhy It Matters\nPresident Donald Trump's trade policy, which has frequently shifted, includes an end to the \"de minimis\" exemption which allows packages at or under $800 to come to the U.S. without paying additional taxes. With the exemption expiring next Friday, some postal services are suspending shipments until they gain clarity on the new import duties.\nIn a July 30 executive order, Trump stated he would remove the exemption for all countries effective August 29, expanding a policy that had already applied to China and Hong Kong. In the order, the president notes that the move is rooted in his effort to reduce fentanyl trade and enforce national security measures.\nThe suspension is expected to impact millions of packages, with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the USPS estimating that in 2021 there were over 3 billion inbound packages.\nWhat To Know\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said Saturday they have stopped shipping merchandise to the U.S., while those in France, Austria and the United Kingdom said they will suspend shipments by early next week, according to the Associated Press.\nDeutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany, the main postal providers in Germany, said in a press statement, \"After August 22, Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany will no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S.\"\nThe Association of European Postal Services, PostEurop, echoed a similar sentiment in an August 19 press release, warning that due to the uncertain nature of the collection process, PostEurop members \"may be constrained to temporarily restrict or suspend the shipping of goods via the postal networks to the USA.\"\nMany of the postal pauses are because the carriers cannot guarantee that the shipments will make it to the U.S. ahead of August 29 and therefore cannot estimate the proper cost. The carriers have asked for clearer terms and guidance on the new framework.\nOn August 15, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) outlined instructions for the shipments, stating that international carriers delivering shipments to the U.S. \"must collect and remit duties to CBP using one of the two methodologies.\"\nOne methodology is that the duty shall equal the \"effective International Emergency Economic Powers Act tariff rate applicable to the country of origin,\" and the second outlines a flat fee per based on tariff rate. For example, for countries with an effective IEEPA tariff rate of less than 16 percent, the charge is $80 per item; for countries with tariff rates between 16 and 25 percent, the fee is $160 per item; and for countries with a rate above 25 percent, $200 per item.\nThe U.S. and European Union (EU) struck a trade deal last month that puts a 15 percent tariff on most goods coming from Europe. That means even smaller packages that used to slip in duty-free under the old $800 limit will now likely get hit with the tariff.\nWhat People Are Saying\nDHL Parcel Germany and Deutsche Post said in a statement: \"Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\"\nThe Association of European Postal Services, PostEurop, said in an August 19 press release: \"Critical issues and processes, such as customs duties collection, the data to be collected, and the interaction with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, are not yet clearly defined. Select technical details were only released on 15 August, leaving an extremely short timeframe to prepare. At this time, if critical issues and processes are not defined and, thus, compliant solutions cannot be found before the regulations take effect on 29 August 2025, PostEurop Members, in alignment with the competent National Authorities, may be constrained to temporarily restrict or suspend the shipping of goods via the postal networks to the USA.\"\nPoste Italiane said Friday: \"In the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted.\"\nWhat Happens Next?\nSmaller sellers, including local artisans, have warned that eliminating the exemption will make it too costly for them to ship goods to U.S. buyers.\nThe duty-free threshold ends at 12:01 a.m. on August 29.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

      "text": "Postal services in India, Europe to suspend shipment of packages to U.S. over import tariffs\nMultiple postal services around Europe announced Saturday that they are suspending the shipment of many packages to the United States amid a lack of clarity over new import duties.\nPostal services in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Italy said they will stop shipping most merchandise to the U.S. effective immediately. France and Austria will follow Monday, and the United Kingdom Tuesday.\nIndia's government also said the country will temporarily suspend postal deliveries to the United States starting Monday, except letters, documents and gift items of up to $100 in value, the AFP reported.\nUnder a decree signed by President Donald Trump last month, international goods that were previously exempt from U.S. tariffs — those valued under $800 — will be subject to import duties from Aug. 29. Letters, books, gifts and small parcels worth less than $100 will continue to be exempt.\nA trade framework agreed by the U.S. and the European Union last month set a 15% tariff on the vast majority of products shipped from the EU.\nMany European postal services say they are pausing deliveries now because they cannot guarantee the goods will enter the U.S. before Aug. 29. They cite ambiguity about what kind of goods are covered by the new rules, and the lack of time to process their implications.\nStarting Saturday, Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany said they \"will no longer be able to accept and transport parcels and postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US.\"\n\"Key questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out,\" DHL, the largest shipping provider in Europe, said in a statement.\nPostnord, the Nordic logistics company, and Italy's postal service announced similar suspensions effective Saturday.\n\"In the absence of different instructions from US authorities ... Poste Italiane will be forced, like other European postal operators, to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing goods destined for the United States, starting August 23. Mail shipments not containing merchandise will continue to be accepted,\" Poste Italiane said Friday.\nShipping by services such as DHL Express remains possible, it added.\nBjörn Bergman, head of PostNord's Group Brand and Communication, said the pause was \"unfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules.\"\nIn the Netherlands, PostNL spokesperson Wout Witteveen said the Trump administration is pressing ahead with the new duties despite U.S. authorities lacking a system to collect them. He said that PostNL is working closely with its U.S. counterparts to find a solution.\n\"If you have something to send to America, you should do it today,\" Witteveen told The Associated Press.\nIndia's communications ministry said in a statement that the executive order issued last month requires transport carriers or other \"qualified parties\" approved by US authorities to collect and remit the tariff duties, but \"several critical processes relating to the designation of 'qualified parties' and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined.\"\n\"Consequently, US-bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after 25th August, 2025, citing lack of operational and technical readiness,\" the ministry said.\nAustrian Post, Austria's leading logistics and postal service provider, stated that the last acceptance of commercial shipments to the U.S., including Puerto Rico, will take place Tuesday.\nFrance's national postal service, La Poste, said the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time for the French postal service to prepare for new customs procedures.\n\"Despite discussions with U.S. customs services, no time was provided to postal operators to re-organize and assure the necessary computer updates to conform to the new rules,\" it said in a statement.\nThe UK's Royal Mail said it would halt U.S. shipments on Tuesday \"to allow time for those packages to arrive before duties kick in.\" Items originating in the U.K. will require a 10% duty for items over $100, it said.\nPostEurop, an association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no solution can be found by Aug. 29 all its members will likely follow suit."

      "text": "NEW DELHI: In a significant development with far-reaching implications for trade and personal shipments, the Department of Posts announced on Saturday a temporary suspension of all postal services to the United States, effective 25 August, citing “operational challenges” arising from new US customs regulations.\nThe move follows the issuance of Executive Order No. 14324 by the US administration on 30 July, which revokes the long-standing duty-free de minimis exemption for imported goods valued at up to USD 800.\nThe new rules, coming into effect on 29 August, will subject all international shipments to customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) framework.\n“All international postal items destined for the USA, regardless of their value, shall be subject to customs duties,” an official release from the Ministry of Communications said, adding that only letters/documents and gift items valued up to USD 100 will remain exempt for the time being.\nAlthough the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued preliminary guidelines on 15 August, key components of the new customs framework, including the designation of “qualified parties” authorised to collect and remit duties, remain “undefined”, according to the department.\n“Several critical processes… remain undefined. Consequently, US-bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after 25 August 2025, citing lack of operational and technical readiness,” the official press release noted.\nThe suspension comes amid escalating trade tensions between New Delhi and Washington. President Donald Trump recently announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods, coupled with an additional 25% penalty allegedly targeting India’s purchases of Russian oil, effectively raising the total tariff burden on certain imports to 50%.\nThese developments have sparked concerns within India’s trade and logistics sectors, particularly given the volume of small-scale exports and personal shipments reliant on international postal services.\nThe Department of Posts emphasised that customers who have already booked shipments to the US falling outside the allowed categories can apply for a full refund of postage fees. It also sought to reassure users that the situation is being closely monitored in coordination with US authorities and logistics partners.\n“The Department is closely monitoring the evolving situation… and every effort is being made to normalise services at the earliest possible opportunity,” it said.\nUntil further notice, only the following categories will be accepted for dispatch to the US: letters and documents, and gift items up to USD 100 in value.\nAll other categories, including commercial packages, e-commerce shipments, and parcels exceeding the exemption limit, will be blocked from booking starting 25 August.\nThis temporary halt in postal services to one of India’s major international partners marks a rare disruption and highlights the broader uncertainties introduced by shifting US trade and customs policies.\n“How long the suspension will last remains unclear as it hinges on further clarity from US authorities and readiness of air carriers to comply with the new framework,” explained an official."

      "text": "India suspended all postal services to the United States on Saturday — citing recent tariff policy updates made by President Donald Trump. The temporary pause will go into effect from August 25 as an executive order eliminating the de minimis exemption comes into effect. Trump had scrapped the tax rule exempting entry of goods valued under $800 without customs duties and other taxes — part of a bid to combat unfair trade practices and tariff evasion.\n“All international postal items destined for the USA, regardless of their value, shall be subject to customs duties as per the country-specific International Emergency Economic Power Act tariff framework. However, gift items up to the value of $100 shall continue to remain exempt from duties,” the Department of Posts noted in an official communique.\nThe US Customs and Border Protection will soon be required to collect and remit duties on postal shipments in accordance with the executive order. Indian authorities however noted that several critical details remained missing about the updated process. The PIB update added that US-bound air carriers had consequently expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25 due to a “lack of operational and technical readiness”.\n‘Temporary suspension of all bookings’\nAccording to the update shared by government, bookings have been temporarily suspended for all types of postal articles destined for the US. The change will take effect from August 25 and apply to all items except letters/documents and gift items up to $100 in value.\n“The Department is closely monitoring the evolving situation in coordination with all stakeholders, and every effort is being made to normalize services at the earliest possible opportunity. Customers who have already booked articles that cannot be dispatched to the USA due to these circumstances may seek a refund of postage,” the PIB update said.\nWhat is the de minimis exemption?\nThe de minimis exemption is a tariff and tax rule that had so far allowed shipments entering the United States to be exempt from customs duties and taxes if their value was below a certain threshold. The de minimis threshold in the US was set at $800 per person per day — meaning goods valued under $800 could enter the country duty-free and without the need for detailed customs reporting."

While CBP issued preliminary guidelines on August 15, several key issues- such as who qualifies as an authorised party and how the duties will be collected- remain unresolved. This lack of clarity has led US-bound air carriers to refuse postal consignments beyond August 25, citing technical and operational hurdles.\nIndia’s response: Service suspension\nIn light of the developments, India Post has decided to suspend the booking of all US-bound postal articles effective August 25. The only exceptions are letters, documents, and gift parcels not exceeding USD 100 in value, which will continue to be accepted until further notice.\nRefunds and customer support\nCustomers who have already booked parcels that can no longer be dispatched to the US will be eligible for a postage refund. The Department of Posts expressed regret for the disruption and assured that it is working closely with CBP, USPS, and other stakeholders to resolve the situation and restore services as quickly as possible.\nThe suspension underscores the ripple effects of the US’s tariff policy shift, with cross-border e-commerce and personal shipments likely to be hit hardest. The timeline for full restoration of postal services will depend on clarity from US authorities on duty-collection mechanisms and carrier participation."

Hopefully it’s not urgent, because it’s going to be a minute before that thing gets to our shores. Questions surrounding the Trump administration’s ongoing tariff regime, including a policy to end an exemption from taxing small packages, have resulted in postal services across the world simply choosing not to ship to the United States until things get sorted out, according to Bloomberg.\nCentral to this problem is the de minimis exemption, which allows packages valued at no more than $800 to enter the country without being subject to tariffs. According to the White House, about four million packages that qualify for the policy enter the United States every single day, amounting to more than 1.35 billion per year. Trump has rolled back that policy considerably, setting the new bar at a value of under $100 to enter the country duty-free. Everything else will be subject to the tariffs that apply to the country from where the package is being shipped.\nThat new policy is set to go into effect on August 29, and the rest of the world is throwing up its hands about it. Per Bloomberg, there are still questions as to how the tariffs will be collected and how countries are even supposed to submit the relevant information to US authorities. Instead of dealing with all that, some countries are opting to simply not ship to America for the time being.\nBloomberg reported that Korea’s postal service, Korea Post, will stop sending packages to the US starting Tuesday. Singapore’s SingPost and Austria’s postal provider will do the same, just a day earlier. Norway and Finland are getting an even bigger head start, announcing that they will stop sending packages to America starting on Saturday, and Belgium is halting shipments as of Friday. Deutsche Post in Germany and the Czech Republic’s postal service have already stopped shipping packages state-side due to the confusion. Other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, announced temporary suspensions until they get things sorted.\nPresumably, these things will get straightened out, as this pause should be too much of a pain point for the Trump administration to drag this out forever, though it does seem to have a penchant for self-inflicted wounds. But the fact that this whole plan has been applied so haphazardly does not exactly infuse the rest of the world with confidence that things are going to be stable and predictable when doing business with the US.\nMeanwhile, it’ll be low-income Americans hit the hardest by this new policy, per the National Bureau of Economic Research, which found that eliminating the de minimis exemption would increase average tariffs faced by the poorest ZIP codes in the country to about 12%, nearly double the impact on richer ZIP codes. In total, the researchers warn that ditching di minimis will reduce consumer welfare by between $11 billion and $13 billion per year. But hey, that’s a small price to pay for pissing off the whole world to little actual gain."

It eliminates the existing duty-free threshold for international postal shipments.\nUnder the new policy, all postal items sent to the US, regardless of value or origin, will be subject to customs duties.\nThis change affects individuals and businesses globally, including Maltese customers.\nPartners cargo carriers and airlines have informed MaltaPost they are also suspending the carriage of postal shipments destined for the US “until a workable process is put in place”.\n“The suspension is a temporary and necessary measure to allow for the development, testing, and implementation of new cross-border technical and airline carrier solutions to comply with the new U.S. requirements,” MaltaPost said.\nThey added that postal operators across Europe are “working together to meet these obligations as quickly as possible.”\nHowever, they conceded that “several key implementation details remain unclear” including how US customs imposed duties will be collected and how data must be submitted.\n“Limited technical guidance was only issued by US Customs and Border Protection on August 15, leaving insufficient time for full implementation by the imposed deadline,” MaltaPost said."

      "text": "Postal services across the world are suspending parcel deliveries to the US as the end of duty-free treatment for low-value packages starting next week sows chaos in global shipping.\nAs of Aug. 29, President Donald Trump is ending the so-called de minimis exemption that has applied to more than 4 million parcels flowing through the US each day, driven largely by e-commerce.\nUnder the new regime, which started with China and Hong Kong in May, goods mailed from other countries will be subject to tariffs and compliance with Customs and Border Protection rules. Verified gifts valued at less than $100 will remain duty-free and American travelers are still allowed to re-enter the country with $200 or less in personal items purchased abroad, according to the White House.\nIn response to the changes, a growing number of national mail services are pausing service to the US as soon as this week, citing a lack of clarity from US authorities on how the duties will be collected and how to submit required data.\nIn Asia, Korea Post said it will halt accepting air parcels and some express mail services to the US starting Tuesday, while keeping premium services, operated via private couriers, available subject to customs duties.\nSimilarly, Singapore’s SingPost will suspend standard services for commercial shipments to America from Monday, with Speedpost’s Express and Direct International Service available to retail and corporate customers, respectively.\nJapan warned of potential delays or returned parcels because of the changes, with authorities vowing to share more information when available.\nEuropean postal services also made adjustments in light of the changes, with several suspending shipments. Norway and Finland’s mail carriers both said their stoppages begin Saturday.\nNo Details\n“Customs duties must be paid before goods can be shipped to the US,” Posti, Finland’s mail service, said on its website. “US Customs has not yet provided details on how the payment process will work. Postal operators in various countries currently lack systems to collect the required customs duties.”\nThe Czech Republic has halted US-bound parcels, while Austria’s postal provider will stop accepting them after Aug. 25, citing the changes. Belgium’s Bpost will reportedly pause shipments from Friday due to regulatory uncertainty.\nThe UK’s Royal Mail plans a brief suspension next week to implement a revised system for handling the newly imposed duties.\nAustralia Post has temporarily suspended its transit service deliveries — a small number of items from third countries sent through Australia to the US, a spokesperson confirmed. However, regular direct deliveries between the two countries will be unaffected.\nThe White House and CBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe service interruptions highlight the seismic impact from Trump’s decision to eliminate the de minimis exemption and raise concerns that cheap goods — from China especially — will flood into other economies given the new barriers in the US.\nWashington’s long-standing policy had allowed low-value parcels to flow into the US from around the world with little interruption or oversight, fueled by consumer demand for deals and speed. The White House claims it’s been abused to evade tariffs and funnel illegal drugs.\n‘Real Concern’\nNow, postal services, online sellers, consumers and shipping companies are attempting to sort through the costly and complicated process to comply with US rules with little guidance from federal agencies.\n“It is a real concern that the dominoes are falling and there will be a ripple effect where more and more posts announce that they will be suspending packages to the US,” said Kate Muth, executive director of the International Mailers Advisory Group, which represents the US international mailing and shipping industry.\nOnce the exemption ends, duties will be assessed on US imports shipped by mail based on the country-of-origin tariff rate that Trump imposed using his emergency powers. Alternatively, packages shipped via international post could be assessed with a temporary flat fee of $80 to $200 per item, but only for the next six months.\nCBP outlined in an Aug. 15 bulletin how the flat fees would be calculated, corresponding to the countries’ tariff rates. The agency also offered some additional instruction to shippers on Thursday, when it issued guidance certifying two companies to collect and pay duties on behalf of international mail carriers.\n“It’s obviously very welcomed,” Muth said, “but it’s still a concern that we’re just a week away and we only have the first two approved.”\nThe fallout is extending beyond mail carriers. Starting Aug. 25, online marketplace Etsy Inc. plans to suspend its shipping label service for national mail services in Australia, Canada and the UK for US-bound packages, according to its website.\nThe company suggested that shippers use carriers with services in place that allow them to pay duties before goods arrive in the US, such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.\nFedEx said it continues to accept and transport shipments to the US and is unaffected by the postal operators’ decisions. UPS had no immediate comment.

due to come into effect next week.\nGlobal postal carriers have described a \"chaotic\" environment as some European services halt US shipments altogether.\nWhat's next?\nFrom August 29, low-value parcels imported into the US will attract tariffs or flat fees.\nAustralia Post is suspending some forms of shipping to the United States as a Trump administration tariff deadline creates \"chaos\" for postal networks and retailers globally.\nThe development means goods from other countries will no longer be able to be shipped to the US via Australia, a method known as \"transit\" shipping.\n\"In line with a number of other postal operators, Australia Post has temporarily suspended its transit service to the US and will no longer accept transit items containing goods destined for the United States of America,\"an Australia Post spokesperson said.\nAustralia Post's suspension comes as low-value goods imported into the US face additional tariffs from next week.\nUntil now, parcels of goods from Australia worth less than $US800 ($1,200) were not taxed when they arrived in the US, under what was known as the \"de minimis\" exemption.\nThe tax exemption is due to end on August 29 for imports from all countries globally, with parcels to be slugged with tariffs or flat fees.\n'Chaotic' moment for global postal services\nThe decision — formalised in an executive order on July 30 — has caught many postal operators globally off guard.\nKate Muth, who leads the US-based trade association, International Mailers Advisory Group (IMAG), said many of its members are confused about how to collect the duties set to come into play from next week.\n\"It's a bit chaotic here,\" she told ABC News from Washington, DC.\n\"A lot of uncertainty, a lot of concern about the postal stream being heavily impacted, and just a little over a week to get ready.\"\nAustralia Post is one of the global postal carriers that has elected to suspend transit mail to the US as it grapples with changes.\n\"[Transit mail] is where a postal operator in one country will use the services of another postal operator to send it on to the final destination,\" Ms Muth explained.\n\"For example, maybe the Philippines post uses Australia Post to send mail to the United States because Philippines has low volumes or infrequent flights.\"\nThe government-owned entity has not confirmed how many nations use Australia for transit mail, or what volume it handles for other countries, ultimately destined for the US.\nUncertainty around collection of tariffs\nABC News has sighted an \"emergency information\" letter from the United Nations' specialised postal agency informing members globally about Australia Post's decision.\n\"This measure will take effect on 20 August 2025,\" the letter read.\n\"Any transit or misrouted items containing goods that are destined for the United States and arrive at Australia Post's international mail processing centres will be returned to origin.\"\nThe uncertainty with postage has also created chaos for Australian e-commerce retailers, with one Brisbane based brand, Apéro, deciding to halt shipping to the US this week.\n\"The volatility in decision making, and the volatility of the market, and, quite frankly, the lack of ability of even Australia Post to be able to address these issues in a timely manner, puts us, and all of Australian fashion, in a really precarious position,\" Apéro co-founder Laz Smith told ABC News this week.\n\"We're just trying to react as quickly as we can.\"\nIMAG's Ms Muth said the overarching concern is that many postal carriers are not set up to \"collect and remit\" the duties specified by Donald Trump's executive order.\n\"Australian Post is not set up to do that … they obviously have to work with either an airline carrier who is willing to do [this], and we have not heard of any airline carrier that's willing to,\" she said.\nSeveral postal carriers globally have already gone one step further ahead of August 29 and suspended shipping to the US entirely.\nThey include Bpost — a logistics company based in Brussels — and several others in Europe.\nPostNord — which services Sweden and Denmark — has additionally axed shipments to Puerto Rico.\n\"Letters without goods will not be affected,\" PostNord's announcement said. \"Customers and partners will be kept updated and informed.\"\nAustralia Post would not confirm whether it is poised to halt US shipments entirely.\n\"Our priority is to keep our customers updated on the changes and what they mean for them,\"the spokesperson said.\nAustralia Post has sent updates to merchant retailers and uploaded information about the end of de minimis on its website.\n\"Australia Post is investigating paying duties and taxes through an approved third-party platform provider on behalf of our merchants,\" it wrote to merchants on Monday.\n\"These duties and taxes, including a handling fee, would be retrospectively charged to our merchant senders.\""

The exemption used to allow international shipments under $800 to cross the border with minimal paperwork and no duties.\nNow, these shipments will face tariffs, and not every operator can handle the customs declaration paperwork, have a payment mechanism in place, or be responsible for returns should a receiver refuse to pay tariffs. It's unclear when the temporary freeze on shipments will resume.\n\"Due to the short timeframe to adapt to the new specific requirements, PostNord will temporarily halt shipments to the United States and Puerto Rico until a compliant solution has been developed and implemented,\" wrote the operator owned by the Swedish and Danish governments in a statement on Wednesday.\nSeparately, Posten Bring, Norway's primary postal provider operated by the government, said in a statement that postal services have not been given clear instructions and solutions on how the duties will be paid or who would be responsible for returns. Therefore, Posten Bring sees suspension as the \"only option.\"\nAll three European postal services will suspend shipments starting August 23, which applies to all packages other than letters. This means that if you have a pending purchase that is not shipped by the deadline, your seller may need to cancel your order or arrange alternatives.\nBut even if you're not purchasing from these specific European countries, your shopping options might still dwindle and become more costly.\nEtsy, the US e-commerce giant and a hub for independent crafters, posted a notice Wednesday that shipping label purchases for Australia Post, Canada Post, Evri, and Royal Mail for US-bound packages will be temporarily suspended starting August 25.\nEtsy wrote in a statement that these operators are unable to support prepaid duties at the moment, which may result in a large number of rejected packages due to unpaid duties and surprise costs for buyers not listed at checkout.\nAcross social media platforms, many independent sellers based in the UK are also announcing that they can no longer support orders to the US, citing the introduction of an $80 flat fee plus handling charges for using Royal Mail to ship parcels to the US.\n\"We hope to resume shipping as soon as we can, but we really don't want our customers to be hit with an $80+ fee,\" wrote the Citrine Circle, a UK-based crystal shop, on Instagram. \"It feels like the world is getting smaller and smaller.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Espinoza joining us now.\nIt all comes down to how packages enter the U.S. and new rules that will change what gets taxed at the center of it.\nA rule called the de minimis exemption, which lets packages worth less than $800 enter the country duty-free, is set to expire on Aug. 29.\nIn 2024, more than 1.3 billion packages worth more than $64 billion arrived through this exemption.\nGermany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy and other European countries have already stopped many package shipments to the U.S. France and Austria will join in on Monday and the United Kingdom’s Royal Mail said it will halt service Tuesday to let packages already in transit arrive before the new duties take hold.\nIn India, postal officials have said starting Aug. 25, they will suspend all shipments to the U.S. except letters document and small gifts under $100.\nMeanwhile, DHL, Europe’s largest shipping provider, is also pulling back. The company said it can’t continue accepting business parcels to the U.S. until there’s more clarity on how the new duties will be handled under the new framework.\nMost goods shipped from Europe will face a 15% tariff, and packages under $800 will no longer be duty-free. In India, any packages over $100 will now be subject to duties with only small gifts and documents exempt.\nAmericans waiting on deliveries from Europe or India could be left hanging with no clear timeline on when normal shipping will resume.\nServices like DHL Express are still operating, though at a much higher cost than regular mail. Regular mail without merchandise is not affected.\nFor consumers, the biggest workaround may be checking where an order is coming from and buying from outside of Europe or India for now.

      "text": "Amid New US Customs Rules, India 'Temporarily Suspends' Postal Services To US; European Postal Services Suspend Deliveries Too\nThe Government of India has announced the temporary suspension of postal services to the United States, effective from Monday, August 25, 2025, following operational constraints triggered by new U.S. customs rules.\nAccording to the Ministry of Communications, the suspension applies to all types of postal articles, except for letters, documents, and gift consignments valued up to $100, which will continue to be accepted and dispatched.\nThis step comes in response to the refusal of U.S.-bound air carriers to carry postal cargo owing to a lack of clarity in compliance processes under fresh American customs regulations.\nThe situation arises from an executive order issued by the U.S. administration on July 30, 2025, which mandates customs duties on imported goods valued above $100, effective August 29.\nTherefore, beginning August 29, 2025, all goods sent to the US, regardless of their value, will be subject to customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) tariff framework.\nThe directive also places responsibility on international transport carriers within the postal system to collect and remit customs duties on such shipments.\nDespite partial guidelines issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on August 15, critical operational aspects—such as the mechanism of designating \"qualified parties\" to oversee duty collection and the channels for remittance—remain undefined.\nThis lack of procedural clarity has created uncertainty for carriers, prompting them to withhold acceptance of postal consignments bound for the U.S., citing the absence of readiness in both operational and technical systems.\nIn light of these challenges, India’s Department of Posts has opted for a precautionary suspension, emphasizing that it is a temporary measure intended to safeguard against disruptions or compliance issues.\nThe Ministry has further clarified that customers who have already booked postal items falling outside the exempted categories—such as commercial goods or high-value parcels exceeding $100—will be entitled to claim a refund of postage charges. The decision underscores the cascading effect of evolving U.S. trade and customs rules on global postal and logistics networks.\nFor now, the Department of Posts has assured that it is in close communication with U.S. authorities and monitoring developments carefully. The Ministry conveyed that “every effort is being made to normalise services at the earliest possible opportunity,” signalling that operations could resume once CBP and USPS provide definitive mechanisms for implementation.\nHowever, with the new U.S. import tariffs set to come into effect from August 29, the immediate outlook suggests continued uncertainty for businesses and individuals reliant on the postal channel for merchandise shipments to the U.S.\nThe impact of this suspension will be felt most acutely by small exporters, e-commerce players, and individuals sending high-value consignments, as postal channels are often the most cost-effective method for such shipments.\nBy contrast, courier operators and larger logistics providers, who already have dedicated customs-compliance systems, may be able to handle the new requirements more readily.\nNonetheless, the disruption to India Post’s U.S.-bound services highlights the broader implications of unilateral customs policy changes in cross-border trade and logistics, reinforcing the need for timely coordination between postal administrations and regulatory agencies.\nThe suspension of India’s postal services to the United States—though categorized as temporary—reflects significant uncertainty stemming from new U.S. customs regimes governing duty collection and enforcement on imports exceeding $100 in value.\nStakeholders across trade, e-commerce, and individual customers are now compelled to await further clarity from American authorities to see when and how India Post will be able to restore normal operations.\nThe expiration of the US 'de minimis' tariff exemption on low-value packages has led European postal services to suspend shipments. This comes after India's US postal services took a similar step amid Donald Trump's new trade policy.\nAfter India's Department of Posts, on August 23, announced that it will temporarily suspend all types of postal articles to the United States amid President Donald Trump's 50 per cent tariffs on India, European postal services are now also pausing deliveries to the US as tariff exemptions on their deliveries come to an end, AP reported.\nBased On TOI Report\nNo comments:\nPost a Comment"

      "text": "Indian and European Postal Services Halt Shipments to US Amid Tariff Overhaul\nBy “Q”, Senior International Trade Reporter TheWatchTower.org August 23, 2025\nIn a significant disruption to global e-commerce, postal services across Europe and India have begun suspending low-value shipments to the United States, citing new tariff regulations imposed by the U.S. government. This move comes as carriers grapple with the abrupt end of a long-standing exemption that allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free, a policy shift aimed at curbing trade loopholes and addressing national security concerns.\nThe suspensions, which started rolling out this week, affect millions of consumers and businesses reliant on affordable international shipping. Germany’s Deutsche Post, along with services in Denmark, Sweden, and Italy, have already halted deliveries of low-value items effective immediately. France and Austria are set to follow suit starting Monday, with France’s La Poste attributing the delay to insufficient time for necessary computer system updates following negotiations with U.S. customs officials. The United Kingdom’s Royal Mail has announced a pause beginning Tuesday, emphasizing the need for technical adjustments to comply with the new rules.\nIndia, a major player in global exports, is also joining the fray. India Post will temporarily cease most cheap postal deliveries to the U.S. starting Monday, adding to the growing list of affected nations. Even private carriers like DHL, Europe’s largest logistics firm, have suspended shipments of the impacted goods, pointing to unresolved issues around customs duties and data submission requirements. PostNord, serving Sweden and Denmark, confirmed it paused goods destined for the U.S. and Puerto Rico as of August 23.\nAt the heart of this international fallout is a July executive order from President Donald Trump, which terminates the de minimis exemption effective August 29. This loophole, in place for decades, facilitated the entry of over 1.3 billion packages valued at $64.6 billion into the U.S. last year without tariffs or extensive scrutiny. Initially targeted at China in April, the policy expansion seeks to close avenues exploited by e-commerce giants like Temu for flooding the market with low-cost goods. More critically, it aims to stem the flow of fentanyl precursors from China, which have fueled the U.S. synthetic opioid crisis by slipping through unchecked shipments.\nThis development builds on the broader U.S.-China trade tensions that escalated during Trump’s first term. The 2018 trade war imposed tariffs on approximately $360 billion worth of Chinese imports, reshaping global supply chains and prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. Now, with the de minimis crackdown extending its reach, postal operators worldwide are scrambling to adapt. Asian services have also begun halting U.S.-bound shipments, exacerbating the chaos.\nThe immediate impact on e-commerce is profound. Carriers warn that they cannot guarantee packages mailed before the deadline will clear U.S. customs without tariffs, leading to widespread confusion and potential delays. Small businesses, particularly those in fashion, electronics, and consumer goods, face higher costs and logistical hurdles. Consumers may see prices rise or availability dwindle for imported items, from clothing to gadgets.\nExperts predict this could accelerate a shift toward consolidated shipping or alternative routes, but in the short term, the suspensions risk straining transatlantic and Indo-U.S. trade relations. As one European logistics executive noted, “This isn’t just about tariffs—it’s about the feasibility of global mail in a fragmented regulatory landscape.”\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency has yet to comment on the suspensions, but officials have defended the policy as essential for fair trade and public safety. With the August 29 deadline looming, stakeholders are urging swift resolutions to minimize economic fallout.\nFor updates on this developing story, visit TheWatchTower.org or follow us on social media.\nSources\n- X Post from DC Examiner\n- European postal services suspend shipment of packages to US over … – AP News\n- Some countries are suspending postal deliveries to the U.S. Here’s … – Washington Post\n- Indian and European postal services will suspend shipments to US … – Washington Examiner\n- Some European Postal Services Halt US Deliveries Over Trump … – Newsweek\n- Multiple postal services, including in India and around Europe, say … – Facebook CBS News\n- European Postal Services Halt U.S. Shipments Over Trump’s Tariffs – The Daily Beast\n- India Suspends Postal Services to U.S. After Trump’s 50% Tariff … – YouTube\n- European postal services suspend shipment of packages to US over … – Indian Express\n- India to suspend postal deliveries to US over tariff confusion – CNA\n- European postal services suspend packages to US over tariffs – Boston Globe\n- DHL joins European peers in pausing many parcel shipments … – CNN\n- European Postal Services Suspend Shipment of Packages to US … – Asharq Al-Awsat\n- French and German postal services suspend certain deliveries to … – Le Monde\n- India Post Suspends US-Bound Parcel Services From August 25 – YouTube\n- India pauses US-bound parcel service over new tariff rule, will … – Hindustan Times\n- Royal Mail and DHL halt some US deliveries over tariffs – BBC\n- European, Indian postal services to halt US-bound packages over … – South China Morning Post\n- India Suspends Parcel Shipments to US over Trump Tariffs – See News\n- Postal Services Across Europe and India Suspend U.S. Shipments … – Wiregrass Daily News\nPostal services in India, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, France, Austria, and the UK are halting shipments to the US due to new tariffs imposed by President Trump.

      "text": "The diplomatic landscape between India and the United States is experiencing a significant shift, primarily driven by recent tariff policies initiated by the Trump administration. Starting August 29, India will suspend all postal services to the US, a decisive move that underscores the mounting tensions over trade tariffs and their ripple effects on global commerce. This suspension marks a pivotal moment in India’s response to unilateral tariff hikes, highlighting concerns over how such measures disrupt international logistics and economic relations.\nBackground: The Rise of Tariffs and Their Global Impact\nIn recent months, the US has imposed hefty tariffs—up to 50%—on various imports, citing reasons ranging from national security to trade imbalances. These tariffs, often viewed as protectionist measures, have prompted retaliatory actions across multiple trading partners. India, as one of the world’s largest economies and a significant trading partner for the US, has found itself impacted directly and indirectly by these policies.\nMultiple reports from reputable sources such as Hindustan Times, The Hindu, and Mint have highlighted the escalation of trade tensions. The US’s tariff tantrums led India to reevaluate its logistical and trade relations, especially concerning postal and courier services that facilitate small-scale commerce, personal shipments, and important business transactions.\nOfficial Announcements and Actions Taken\nThe Indian Postal Department officially announced the suspension of its postal services to the US from August 29, following consultations with regulators and trade authorities. This decision affects both standard parcels and express courier shipments—effectively halting the flow of mail and package deliveries to American recipients.\nSources from HT and The Hindu confirm that the postal department is also suspending new bookings to the US starting August 25, allowing a transitional period before the complete halt takes effect. This pause applies to both international postal packages and other logistics services that facilitate trade and personal communication.\nReasons Behind the Suspension\nThe primary motive for India’s suspension is the retaliatory response to Trump’s tariff policies. As detailed in articles from Hindustan Times and Mint, the move is aimed at signaling displeasure over the 50% tariffs imposed by the US, which have significantly increased the cost of exported goods and disrupted supply chains.\nFurthermore, international courier companies like Royal Mail, DHL, and FedEx have also halted some US deliveries, citing tariffs as critical barriers. Their actions mirror India’s stance, collectively pointing towards widespread disruptions in cross-border logistics.\n**Key reasons include:**\n- Increased Shipping Costs: Tariffs have made US-bound shipments more expensive, discouraging trade and personal shipments.\n- Disrupted Supply Chains: Heavy tariffs on goods increase transit times and costs, affecting manufacturers and consumers alike.\n- Retaliatory Measures: As a form of diplomatic protest, India has chosen to suspend postal services, aligning with other nations’ responses.\n- Protection of Domestic Interests: India aims to safeguard its postal and courier sector from being adversely affected by tariffs and trade barriers.\nImplications for Small Businesses and Consumers\nThis suspension bears significant consequences for small businesses that rely on international shipping for their livelihood. Many Indian artisans, e-commerce sellers, and exporters depend heavily on US postal services to reach customers. The halt may lead to delays, increased costs, and potential loss of revenue.\nSimilarly, individual consumers who send gifts or personal packages to friends and family in the US could face disruptions, creating frustrations and potentially damaging personal relationships across borders.\nInternational Reactions and Broader Effects\nAs India joins other countries like Germany and the UK in limiting US postal services amid tariffs, the move signals a broader trend of global pushback against unilateral trade measures. Major logistics companies such as DHL, Royal Mail, and FedEx have also announced halts on US deliveries, citing tariffs as a primary reason.\nThese collective responses exemplify how trade policies at the US federal level can trigger a domino effect, affecting international logistics, diplomatic ties, and economic stability. The global supply chain, already strained by pandemic-related disruptions, now faces further instability due to escalating tariff conflicts.\nLooking Ahead: Possible Diplomatic and Trade Resolutions\nWhile India’s suspension is a clear protest against US tariff policies, it also underscores the need for diplomatic dialogue to resolve trade disagreements. The USA has historically used tariffs as leverage, but such measures often backfire by damaging international goodwill and economic cooperation.\nBoth nations may seek to re-engage in negotiations to de-escalate tensions. Until then, the suspension of postal services acts as a tangible symbol of displeasure and a call for reconsideration of tariffs.\nConclusion: Navigating a Challenging Trade Environment\nIndia’s decision to suspend postal services to the US from August 29 is a decisive response rooted in protecting national interests amid rising trade tensions. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of diplomacy, trade policies, and international logistics. As the global community observes these developments, the importance of diplomatic negotiations and fair trade practices becomes ever more apparent in maintaining peaceful and mutually beneficial international relations.\nFor now, both countries and their citizens will need to adapt to the changing landscape, which may include delays, increased costs, and intensified diplomatic efforts to restore normalcy in trade and communication channels.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe suspension serves as a reminder that trade policies have direct, tangible impacts beyond governments—affecting businesses, consumers, and international relations. Both India and the US are at a critical juncture where dialogue and compromise are essential to overcoming current obstacles.\nFor more updated news please keep visiting Hourly Prime News."

      "text": "India to Temporarily Halt Postal Services to USA from August 25, 2025\nSuspension Linked to New US Customs Rules and Rising Trade Tensions Between India and the US\nPostal Services to USA Suspended Temporarily\nThe Department of Posts, India, has announced a temporary suspension of all postal services to the United States, effective August 25, 2025. This decision comes as a direct response to changes in US customs regulations and rising Indo-US trade tensions.\nWhy the Suspension?\nStarting August 29, 2025, the United States will implement revised customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) framework. These changes will impact all international postal items destined for the US, regardless of their value.\nKey reasons for the suspension include:\n- US Executive Order No. 14324, issued on July 30, 2025\n- Removal of duty-free exemption on imported goods worth up to $800\n- Only letters, documents, and gift items valued below $100 will remain duty-free\n- US-bound carriers unable to comply with new customs collection rules\nBackground: Trade Tensions Fuel the Move\nThe move follows US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose:\n- A 25% tariff on Indian goods\n- An additional 25% penalty for India’s oil trade with Russia\nThis policy shift has strained trade relations between the two nations and prompted logistic challenges for postal services.\nAir Carriers Not Ready\nUnder the new customs enforcement:\n- Only “qualified parties”, approved by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), can collect and remit duties\n- Air carriers have stated they are not operationally or technically prepared to handle these new requirements\n- As a result, they will not accept postal consignments to the US for now\nIndia Post’s Official Statement\nIn an official release, India Post stated:\n“The Department of Posts deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to customers and assures that all possible measures are being undertaken to resume full services to the USA at the earliest.”\nThe department also confirmed it is closely monitoring the situation and is in constant touch with international stakeholders to normalize operations as soon as possible.\nWhat You Should Know\n- All postal services to the US paused from August 25, 2025\n- Customs duties apply to all US-bound packages from August 29\n- Letters, documents, and gifts under $100 remain duty-free\n- Temporary measure until carriers meet new customs handling protocols\nWhen Will Services Resume?\nThere is no confirmed date for resumption yet, but India Post has reassured the public that restoration of full services is a top priority.\nThe temporary halt in postal services to the USA marks a significant shift in international logistics and trade relations between India and the United States. Customers are advised to plan accordingly and stay updated through official India Post announcements."

However, gift items up to the value of USD 100 shall continue to remain exempt from duties.\nAs per the Executive Order, transport carriers delivering shipments through the international postal network, or other “qualified parties” approved by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), are required to collect and remit duties on postal shipments. While CBP issued certain guidelines on 15th August, 2025, several critical processes relating to the designation of “qualified parties” and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined. Consequently, U.S. bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after 25th August, 2025, citing lack of operational and technical readiness.\nIn view of the above, the Department of Posts has decided to temporarily suspend booking of all types of postal articles, destined for the USA with effect from 25th August, 2025 except letters/documents and gift items up to USD100 in value. These exempt categories will continue to be accepted and conveyed to the USA, subject to further clarifications from CBP and USPS.\nThe Department is closely monitoring the evolving situation in coordination with all stakeholders, and every effort is being made to normalize services at the earliest possible opportunity.\nCustomers who have already booked articles that cannot be dispatched to the USA due to these circumstances may seek a refund of postage.

      "bias": "unknown",
      "text": "In a move that underscores the escalating tensions in global trade, postal services in Germany and France have imposed significant restrictions on package deliveries to the United States, citing complications from new tariffs under President Donald Trump’s administration. The announcements, made on Friday, highlight how trade policies are disrupting everyday logistics and e-commerce flows between Europe and the U.S.\nDeutsche Post DHL Group, Germany’s leading postal operator, stated it would suspend its standard category of package deliveries to the U.S. effective immediately. Similarly, France’s La Poste announced curbs on shipments, particularly those falling under the “de minimis” exemption for low-value goods. These measures stem from unanswered questions about implementing the tariffs, which target imports valued under $800, leaving postal services scrambling to comply without clear guidelines.\nThe Ripple Effects on International Shipping: As tariffs reshape supply chains, European postal operators are forced to adapt swiftly, potentially setting a precedent for other nations grappling with U.S. trade barriers. This suspension not only affects consumers but also small businesses reliant on cross-border e-commerce, amplifying the economic fallout from protectionist policies.\nAccording to reports from France 24, the restrictions follow a Trump-era decree that has intensified customs scrutiny, leading to backlogs and increased administrative burdens. DHL, in particular, noted that the lack of preparation time has made it impossible to process shipments without risking delays or rejections at U.S. borders.\nBroader European involvement is evident as well. News outlets like News9live report that postal services in Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Austria, and the UK have also suspended or restricted shipments, pointing to a continent-wide response to the tariffs. This collective action reflects growing frustration with U.S. policies that critics argue unfairly burden international trade partners.\nHistorical Context and Precedents: Drawing from past trade disputes, this development echoes earlier suspensions, such as DHL’s April 2025 halt on high-value packages, signaling a pattern of retaliatory measures amid ongoing tariff wars that could redefine global postal logistics.\nSocial media platforms like X have buzzed with reactions, with users from small business owners to logistics experts expressing dismay. Posts highlight real-world impacts, such as detained packages and lost revenue, underscoring the human element behind these policy shifts. For instance, e-commerce sellers report shutting down U.S. shipping routes due to customs chaos, as noted in various X updates.\nIndustry insiders point to the “de minimis” rule, which previously allowed duty-free entry for goods under $800, as a flashpoint. The Trump administration’s push to close this loophole aims to protect domestic industries but has inadvertently snarled international mail services. Publications such as Digital Journal detail how DHL’s ownership of Deutsche Post amplifies the scale, affecting millions of parcels annually.\nEconomic Implications for E-Commerce: With online retail booming, these restrictions threaten to inflate costs and delay deliveries, prompting businesses to seek alternative routes or absorb higher fees, which could ultimately pass on to consumers in the form of elevated prices.\nAnalysts warn that prolonged suspensions could lead to a reevaluation of trade agreements. Sources from Le Monde emphasize La Poste’s concerns over unanswered queries to U.S. authorities, suggesting diplomatic channels may be engaged to resolve the impasse.\nMeanwhile, U.S. officials have yet to respond publicly, but experts anticipate negotiations to clarify tariff applications. In the interim, European postal services recommend customers use premium tracked services or private couriers like UPS or FedEx, which may navigate the regulations more effectively but at a higher cost.\nLooking Ahead: Potential Resolutions and Long-Term Shifts: As stakeholders await clarity, the incident may accelerate digital innovations in logistics, such as blockchain for customs compliance, while highlighting the need for more resilient international trade frameworks in an era of geopolitical uncertainty.\nThis episode is not isolated; earlier in 2025, DHL suspended deliveries of packages over $800 due to similar red tape, as covered by Toronto Sun. The pattern suggests tariffs are achieving their protective intent but at the expense of efficient global commerce.\nFor industry players, the key takeaway is adaptability. Postal operators are investing in compliance tools, while businesses diversify suppliers to mitigate risks. As trade tensions persist, such disruptions may become the new norm, reshaping how goods move across borders in the 21st century."

      "text": "Indian postal services to US temporarily halted amid new US customs rules\ntext_fieldsNew Delhi: The Department of Posts has announced a temporary suspension of all postal services to the United States starting 25 August, citing operational difficulties linked to newly introduced US customs regulations.\nThe decision comes after the US administration issued Executive Order No. 14324 on 30 July, which removes the long-standing duty-free de minimis exemption for imported goods valued up to USD 800.\nUnder the new rules, set to take effect on 29 August, all international parcels sent to the US will now be subject to customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\nAccording to an official statement from the Ministry of Communications, only letters, documents, and gift items valued at up to USD 100 will remain exempt from these duties for the time being, TNIE reported.\nThe Department of Posts stated that while the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued preliminary guidelines on 15 August, several key aspects of the new customs framework remain unclear, including the designation of “qualified parties” responsible for collecting and remitting duties.\nDue to these unresolved issues, US-bound air carriers have reportedly informed Indian authorities that they will be unable to accept postal consignments after 25 August, citing operational and technical unpreparedness, according to the department’s press release.\nThe suspension of services comes at a time of rising trade tensions between India and the US. Recently, President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods, along with an additional 25% penalty linked to India’s purchases of Russian oil, effectively raising total tariffs on certain imports to 50%.\nThese changes have raised concerns among India’s trade and logistics sectors, as small-scale exporters and individuals relying on international postal services are expected to be significantly affected.\nThe Department of Posts clarified that customers who have already booked shipments to the US that fall outside the permitted categories can apply for a full refund of postage fees. It also assured users that the situation is being monitored closely in coordination with US authorities and logistics partners.\nFor now, only letters, documents, and gift items valued up to USD 100 will be accepted for dispatch to the US. All other categories, including commercial packages, e-commerce consignments, and parcels exceeding the exemption limit, will be blocked from booking starting 25 August.\nOfficials described the suspension as a rare disruption in postal services to one of India’s key international partners, reflecting the uncertainty caused by evolving US trade and customs policies. The duration of the halt remains uncertain and will depend on further clarification from US authorities and the preparedness of air carriers to comply with the new framework."

Until now, this threshold allowed shipments of lower value (up to 800 dollars) to undergo a simplified customs inspection and not be subject to the payment of customs duties.

      "text": "New Delhi: Citing operational changes in US customs rules linked to Trump tariffs that will come into effect later this month, the department of posts on Saturday announced a temporary suspension of all postal services to the US from August 25.\nThe decision comes after the U.S. administration ended the duty-free exemption for low-value goods, previously capped at $800, under a new customs order that takes effect on August 29. Under the revised system, all postal consignments, regardless of value, will attract customs duty. The move is part of Washington’s broader effort to close what it called “loopholes” in cross-border e-commerce.\nIndian postal authorities said they were suspending services as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has not provided clarity on how the new duties will be collected and remitted by international postal operators. “Without clear procedures in place, we cannot process items bound for the US,” a senior postal official said.\nThe suspension will affect most parcel and goods services. However, the Department clarified that letters, documents, and gift items up to $100 in value will still be accepted for dispatch to the U.S. until further notice.\nThe move is expected to disrupt cross-border trade and personal shipments between India and the U.S., a route that handles significant e-commerce traffic. Postal operators in several other countries, including South Korea, Singapore, and European nations, have also halted or restricted parcel shipments to the U.S. over similar concerns.\nThe changes follow an executive order issued by Trump on July 30, eliminating the long-standing “de minimis” exemption for low-value imports. The rule, which saw shipments under $800 enter duty-free, was widely used by global sellers and individuals for small parcels.

These exempt categories will continue to be accepted and conveyed to the US, subject to further clarifications from CBP and USPS, the Ministry of Communications said in a statement.\n“The Department is closely monitoring the evolving situation in coordination with all stakeholders, and every effort is being made to normalize services at the earliest possible opportunity,” it added.\nThe Department of Posts has taken note of the Executive Order issued by the US Administration on July 30, 2025, under which the “duty-free de minimis exemption for goods valued up to $800 will be withdrawn with effect from August 29, 2025.\nConsequently, all international postal items destined for the US, regardless of their value, shall be subject to customs duties as per the country-specific International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) tariff framework.\nHowever, gift items up to the value of $100 will continue to remain exempt from duties.\nAs per the Executive Order, transport carriers delivering shipments through the international postal network, or other “qualified parties” approved by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), are required to collect and remit duties on postal shipments.\nWhile CBP issued certain guidelines on August 15, 2025, several critical processes relating to the designation of “qualified parties” and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined.\nConsequently, US-bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25, 2025, citing lack of operational and technical readiness.\n“Customers who have already booked articles that cannot be dispatched to the US due to these circumstances may seek a refund of postage. The Department of Posts deeply regrets the inconvenience caused to customers and assures that all possible measures are being undertaken to resume full services to the US at the earliest,” said the Ministry.\n–IANS\nna/\nComments are closed."

      "text": "Highlights:\n- Suspension effective from August 25, 2025 for all parcels to the US.\n- Triggered by Trump’s Executive Order 14324, ending duty-free import up to $800.\n- US tariffs on Indian goods now total 50%, including penalties on Russian oil trade.\n- Only letters/documents and gift items under $100 remain exempt.\n- Refunds available for undeliverable items; services to resume once systems adapt.\nThe Department of Posts announced on Saturday that all postal services from India to the United States will be suspended temporarily starting August 25, 2025. This decision has been taken in response to sweeping changes in US customs regulations that come into effect later this month.\nTrigger: US tariff moves under executive order\nThe suspension follows the US administration’s July 30 announcement of Executive Order No. 14324. This order eliminates the long-standing de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth up to USD 800 to enter the US without incurring customs duties. From August 29 onward, every postal item arriving in the US, regardless of its declared value, will fall under the purview of customs duties.\nImpact of Trump’s tariff imposition on India\nThe move comes against the backdrop of escalating trade frictions between the two countries. President Donald Trump recently announced a hefty tariff package targeting India: a 25 percent standard tariff combined with an additional 25 percent penalty for India’s ongoing purchases of Russian oil. This effectively raises the tariff burden on Indian goods exported to the US to 50 percent, sharply increasing trade tensions.\nNew customs rules creating bottlenecks\nAs per the statement, US-bound shipments will now require transport carriers or “qualified parties” approved by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to collect and remit duties on behalf of the sender. While CBP issued initial guidelines on August 15, key operational details are still missing. Processes related to the appointment of qualified parties and duty collection mechanisms remain undefined.\nAirlines unable to accept shipments\nDue to these ambiguities, international air carriers handling postal consignments from India have conveyed that they will be unable to accept shipments destined for the US after August 25. Without a clear system in place for the collection of duties, carriers face operational challenges and financial risks, leading to the immediate suspension of services.\nPartial exemptions offered\nDespite the broad suspension, certain categories of mail will remain unaffected. Specifically, letters, documents, and gift items valued up to USD 100 will continue to be accepted and delivered without customs duties under the updated framework. All other postal articles, regardless of transaction value, are currently blocked until further clarity emerges.\nRefunds and customer guidance\nThe Department of Posts has assured customers who had already sent consignments that have now been rendered undeliverable that they will be eligible for a refund of postage charges. To assist affected individuals and businesses, post offices across the country will provide guidance regarding refunds and information about the suspension order.\nMonitoring the situation\nIn its release, the postal department emphasized that it is “closely monitoring the evolving situation in coordination with all stakeholders.” The government is reportedly in discussions with both domestic logistics operators and US authorities in an attempt to normalize services as soon as possible.\nBroader trade implications\nThe suspension of postal services highlights the broader ramifications of worsening trade relations between India and the US. Small exporters, e-commerce sellers, and individuals who rely on the postal network to ship goods to American markets may be particularly affected. While private courier and freight services are expected to adapt faster to the new customs environment, costs are likely to surge, putting pressure on smaller businesses.\nSnoop Dogg faces backlash after criticising LGBTQ+ representation in Pixar’s 'Lightyear'"

Consequently, many U.S.-bound air carriers have declared their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25, 2025, citing a lack of technical and operational readiness.\nIn view of these challenges, the Indian Department of Posts will suspend booking of all postal articles—except letters, documents, and gift items up to USD 100—that are destined for the USA from August 25 onwards. The exempt categories will continue to be accepted and conveyed based on further clarifications from CBP and the United States Postal Service (USPS).\nThe Department is closely monitoring the situation and working with stakeholders to restore full postal services to the USA as soon as possible.

This new regulation will come into play on August 29.\nImpact of the Tariff Changes\n- Packages valued under $100 will remain exempt from duties.\n- All other parcels will now incur tariffs equal to those imposed on similar goods from their countries of origin.\nDue to these changes, postal companies, including Royal Mail and Deutsche Post DHL, have announced a suspension of their U.S. delivery services. They have stated that they require additional time to implement systems that comply with the new guidelines.\nResponse from Postal Services\nRoyal Mail has announced that it will terminate its current export services to the U.S. starting Tuesday, with the aspiration of having an updated system operational within two days to align with the new regulations.\nAccording to a Royal Mail spokesperson, “Royal Mail is working closely with the U.S. authorities and international partners to manage the impact of these changes which will affect everyone who sends goods to the USA.”\nInternational Reactions\nOther postal operators like Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany have declared a suspension of shipments intended for U.S. business clients, citing that significant questions over duty payment processes remain unresolved.\nWhile DHL is “closely monitoring the further developments,” they emphasized that their express delivery services to the U.S. are still operational.\nConcerns and Observations\nVarious postal services including PostNord have also ceased shipments, with PostNord’s communications head, Bjorn Bergman, stating, “This decision is unfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance with the newly implemented rules.”\nAdditionally, the online marketplace Etsy indicated they will stop offering shipping label purchases starting August 25 for certain services as courier companies adjust to these new measures.\nConclusion\nThis new tariff regulation reflects a broader change in import policy that is expected to impact various sectors, especially those relying on international shipping. As postal services work to adapt to these changes, businesses and consumers alike are encouraged to stay informed about the evolving situation."

      "text": "Mail services around the world halt US deliveries ahead of de minimis end\nPOSTAL services across the world are cutting off parcel deliveries to the US as the fast-approaching end of a tariff exception for low-value packages sows chaos in global shipping.\nAs at Aug 29, President Donald Trump is ending the so-called de minimis exemption that has applied to more than four million parcels processed by US Customs and Border Protection each day.\nIn response, a growing number of national mail services plan to temporarily suspend service to the US as soon as this week, citing a lack of clarity from American authorities on how the duties will be collected and how to submit required data.\nThe Czech Republic’s postal service will suspend US goods shipments until further notice starting on Thursday, according to its website. Austria’s post provider will no longer accept packages bound for the US after Aug 25, citing the changes to US customs rules.\n“There is currently insufficient information available about the customs clearance procedures that will be required in future,” Austrian Post said in a statement. “This tightening of the rules poses major challenges for all postal companies worldwide when shipping goods to the USA.”\nBelgium’s Bpost said it will temporarily stop sending parcels to the US starting Friday due to uncertainty surrounding the new US rules for international shipments, according to newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws.\nBT in your inbox\nStart and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe UK’s Royal Mail meanwhile plans to suspend US shipments for one to two days next week as it transitions to a new system to allow shippers to pay the newly-imposed duties, according to its website.\nAustralia Post has temporarily suspended its transit service deliveries – a small number of items from third countries sent through Australia to the US – a spokesperson confirmed. However, regular deliveries directly from Australia to the US by consumers and businesses will be unaffected.\n“The United States Government recently announced significant changes to its import tariff rules that will impact customers sending items from Australia to the US,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “This is moving very quickly, and we are working at speed and around the clock to find a solution for our customers.”\nThe White House and CBP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe service interruptions highlight the seismic impact from Trump’s decision to eliminate the de minimis exemption.\nThe policy had allowed low-value parcels to flow into the US from around the world with little interruption. Now, postal services, online sellers, consumers and shipping companies are attempting to sort through the costly and complicated process to comply with US rules with little guidance from federal agencies.\n“It is a real concern that the dominoes are falling and there will be a ripple effect where more and more posts announce that they will be suspending packages to the US,” said Kate Muth, executive director of the International Mailers Advisory Group, which represents the US international mailing and shipping industry.\nOnce the exemption ends, duties will be assessed on US imports shipped by mail based on the country-of-origin tariff rate that Trump imposed using his emergency powers. Alternatively, packages shipped via international post could be assessed with a temporary flat fee of US$80 to US$200 per item, but only for the next six months.\nCBP outlined in an Aug 15 bulletin how the flat fees would be calculated, corresponding to the countries’ tariff rates. The agency also offered some additional instruction to shippers on Thursday, when it issued guidance certifying two companies to collect and pay duties on behalf of international mail carriers.\n“It’s obviously very welcomed,” Muth said, “but it’s still a concern that we’re just a week away and we only have the first two approved.”\nThe fallout is extending beyond mail carriers. Starting Aug 25, online marketplace Etsy Inc. plans to suspend its shipping label service for national mail services in Australia, Canada and the UK for US-bound packages, according to its website.\nThe company suggested that shippers use carriers with services in place that allow them to pay duties before goods arrive in the US, such as United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.\nFedEx said it continues to accept and transport shipments to the US and is unaffected by the postal operators’ decisions. UPS had no immediate comment. The US Postal Service didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Express mail service (EMS) packages, with the exception of documents that are not subject to tariffs, will halt Tuesday.\nThe move comes ahead of a new U.S. policy set to take effect at midnight on Friday. For years, goods valued under $800 entered the U.S. tariff-free through international mail. Under the new rule, all incoming postal items — except letters and documents — must be declared and face a 15 percent tariff.\nUntil now, the U.S. government had waived tariffs on goods valued under $800 imported through international mail. However, starting Friday, all international postal items bound for the United States — excluding documents and letters — must be declared and will be subject to a 15 percent tariff.\nThis change stems from a presidential executive order signed on July 30 eliminating the $800 de minimis exemption, which the U.S. administration believes has become a conduit for smuggling narcotics and counterfeit goods.\nThe current international postal network cannot support the processing of mandatory customs declarations and tariff payments for all items, prompting the suspension, according to Korea Post.\nAs an alternative, Korea Post recommended the EMS Premium service operated by private courier companies. Under EMS Premium, the logistics provider handles customs clearance, and tariffs are paid by the recipient. The service may be more cost-effective for packages heavier than 4.5 kilograms (9.9 pounds), but delivery fees for lighter items may be higher.\nKorea Post said it will devise further measures to minimize inconvenience to the public. However, it remains uncertain when customs declaration and tariff systems can be integrated into the existing international postal network.\nThe agency also advised customers planning to send items to the United States to accurately declare the value and purpose of the goods and prepare necessary customs documents such as invoices.\nThis article was originally written in Korean and translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.

We are actively monitoring for any developments and will continue to provide timely updates as more information becomes available.\"\nRoyal Mail in the UK is advising shippers they are \"working closely with the US authorities and international partners to manage the impact of these changes\" and will be introducing a PDDP (Postal Delivered Duties Paid) service for account customers to use when exporting to the USA.\nWhat does this mean for UK customers exporting goods to the USA?\nIf you only send personal correspondence to the USA, you are not affected by these changes and can continue to send these items to the USA, without a customs declaration.If you ship goods to the USA and currently complete a customs declaration, we understand that the following changes will apply on the 29th of August 2025:\n- Senders in the UK will have to calculate, collect (or account for) duties at the point of sale. You may want to consider doing this by integrating a ‘landed cost calculator’ at your online checkout to calculate ‘landed cost’ (taxes and duties). Landed cost calculators can also collect those taxes and duties. The duties are then payable to US Customs in advance of items entering the USA.\n- Decide how you will account for these duties with your customers (e.g., you can choose to pass the cost of duties on to your customers or absorb it) and ensure your customs data is accurate.\n- We understand that the required duties for UK postal shipments will be based on an item’s value and the country-based tariff (country of manufacture rather than country of shipping).\nHow will Royal Mail support customers with these changes?\nRoyal Mail is working closely with the US authorities and international partners to manage the impact of these changes which will affect everyone who sends goods to the USA.\n- To enable you to continue to export goods to the USA, Royal Mail will be introducing a PDDP (Postal Delivered Duties Paid) service for account customers to use when exporting to the USA.\n- This is an extension of our Royal Mail PDDP services, which are currently in use to some EU destinations. This will allow continued ‘postal clearance’ into the USA with the same labelling, tracking and customer notifications. This will replace existing services and support compliance with the new requirements.\n- Our shipping platforms will be updated to capture necessary data to comply with the new requirements (much of which you already provide).\nUPDATE: Royal Mail are now advising there will be a short disruption in availability of shipping to the US to allow time to switch over to the new PDDP services.\nWe are planning to withdraw our existing USA export services on Tuesday 26th August 2025. We recommend customers do not send items using existing services from this date, to allow enough time for them to reach US customs before the new requirements become effective.\nWe are planning a short period (1-2 days) between the withdrawal of existing services and new PDDP services being available to allow us to process and ship all items sent using existing services into the USA before 29th August.\nWe expect the new USA PDDP account services set out below to be available for our customers on Royal Mail shipping solutions from Thursday 28th August 2025.\nCanada Post: Canada Post has confirmed they will be partnering with Zonos to collect duties. Shippers will need to have a Zonos Verified Account and information on how to create one through Canada Post will be coming soon.\nMarketplaces\nEtsy\nEtsy has advised sellers that they are suspending shipping label purchases from the platform for Australia Post, Canada Post, Everi and Royal Mail for US-bound packages, effective August 25th.\nGiven recent changes to tariffs in the US, many postal providers will be suspending service or changing delivery options to the US. In light of this, effective August 25, Etsy will be suspending shipping label purchases on Etsy for Australia Post, Canada Post, Evri and Royal Mail for US-bound packages.\nWe are in close contact with these carriers and will reactivate label offerings on Etsy when they are able to support orders into the US with DDP options.\nSellers are advised to keep an eye on Etsy's Seller Handbook for additional updates and will need to make their own shipping arrangements with Delivery Duties Paid (DDP) or stop selling to the US until Etsy is able to provide a solution to re-enable label purchases for these postal services.\neBay\neBay has promised to protect sellers from late shipping defects and negative or neutral feedback related to tariffs but the actual payment of duties once the de minimis exemption ends will still depend on the carrier/postal service being used.\nIn the UK, shipments which use eBay's Global Shipping Programme will have the duties calculated and charged to the buyer at checkout, but listings using any other international shipping method will not.\nFor other countries, eBay says: \"Duties, import fees, and personal information are typically collected by carriers after checkout. Prices displayed to buyers on eBay may exclude these costs.\"\nYou can check country-specific eBay help pages:\nUPDATE: eBay Canada has now announced they will be disabling the ability to purchase Canada Post labels, effective August 25th.\nDuties and customs clearance: Starting August 29th, all shipments to the US—regardless of value—will be subject to applicable duties and customs clearance. As of this date, Canada Post has advised that its current Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) shipping services to the US (Tracked Packet™ USA, Expedited Parcel™ USA, or Xpresspost™ USA) are not compliant with these changes.\nThere is a significant risk that non-compliant shipments arriving to the US beyond August 29th will be returned to the sender. Therefore, effective August 25th these Canada Post services will be disabled on eBay Labels.\nTo ensure a smooth cross-border shipping experience, we strongly recommend sellers take the following actions immediately to avoid in-transit shipments from being returned.\n- Use a commercial carrier such as UPS, FedEx, DHL, or Purolator that can handle US customs clearance; and note that discounted UPS and FedEx rates are available through eBay Labels.\n- Ensure the item location for your listings is accurate.\n- Include accurate Harmonized Tariff Codes as well as Country/Region of Manufacture (country of origin) information on your listings & customs declarations.\nIt’s important to note that, for any exports to the United States, the Country/Region of Manufacture will be required to properly assess and apply applicable customs duties\nMercari\nMercari is warning users that items shipping from Japan via their partnership with BEENOS will have estimated customs duties added into item prices.\nI'll be keeping this post updated with the latest news from various international postal services and online marketplaces. Stay tuned and let us know in the comments below how the end of de minimis is impacting your ecommerce business!"

      "text": "US De-Minimis Rollback Can Raise Landed Costs By Up To 15%, Cut Indian Shipments By 25%\nThe industry is calling for policy cushioning to safeguard MSME competitiveness in the US market.\nThe proposed removal of the US de minimis exemption, which currently allows duty-free imports below $800, is set to hit Indian cross-border trade hard, with landed costs expected to rise by as much as 8–15% and shipment volumes to fall 15–25%, according to industry experts.\nThe US market is India’s largest for direct-to-consumer exports and over 35% of these shipments use the de minimis route. The rollback could therefore trigger widespread disruptions across price-sensitive sectors such as textiles, apparel, consumer electronics, jewellery, handicrafts and specialty foods.\n\"The removal of the de minimis exception could increase landed costs by 8–15% for small and mid-sized exporters. For India, where over 35% of D2C exports to the U.S. depend on this route, exporters may be forced to consolidate shipments, which will raise compliance and logistics costs,\" said Sunil Kharbanda, chief executive officer at Trezix, warning that the policy shift could slow India's e-commerce momentum.\nFor cross-border payments, the immediate impact will be lower flows. \"We expect a 15–25% immediate drop in shipment volumes, especially in categories like apparel, jewellery, handicrafts, beauty, and small consumer goods. This means lower transaction volumes for payment firms, particularly from MSMEs and D2C brands relying on sub-$800 shipments,\" said Sanjay Tripathy, co-founder of BRISKPE.\nTripathy added that while the short term will be painful, exporters will adapt through bulk shipments, nearshore fulfilment hubs and higher-value product mixes. But he warned that this adjustment would lock in a structurally higher cost base.\nThe industry is calling for policy cushioning, including diplomatic talks with Washington, GST rebates, export incentives, and stronger trade infrastructure, such as bonded warehouses, to safeguard MSME competitiveness in the US market."

This exemption will disappear on 29 August. All parcels will then be subject to taxes and additional costs, regardless of where they were sent from.\nBut the US government has not yet provided clarity on how exactly the taxes should be calculated and collected. According to PostEurop, the umbrella organisation of European postal companies, the first technical details were shared on August 15, which \"barely leaves time to prepare\".\nTemporary measure\nTo protect its customers, Thursday is the last day on which a parcel can be sent to the US, bpost says. This exceptional measure is meant to \"avoid parcels being blocked or unexpected costs for our customers\", said spokesperson Mathieu Goedefroy.\nThe measure is temporary, the company says. It is working with international partners to find a solution as quickly as possible to restart shipments.\n\"We regret this situation,\" Goedefroy said. \"But as long as there is no clarity, we cannot take the risk.\"\n© BELGA PHOTO JONAS ROOSENS\nRelated news"
