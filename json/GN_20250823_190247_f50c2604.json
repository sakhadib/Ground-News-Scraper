      "text": "IDF Launches First Phase of Gaza City Invasion as Netanyahu Approves Conquest Plans\nby Emmitt Barry, Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Chief\nJERUSALEM (Worthy News) – The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Wednesday that it has begun the initial stages of its long-anticipated invasion of Gaza City, with troops already controlling the outskirts of the enclave’s largest urban center.\nBrig.-Gen. Effie Defrin, the IDF spokesman, said the operation is being carried out alongside measures to facilitate the evacuation of civilians and the provision of aid and medical care. To support the effort, some 60,000 call-up orders for reservists are being issued this week, with an additional 20,000 expected later in the month.\nKhan Yunis Ambush\nDefrin also addressed a Hamas raid on an IDF encampment in Khan Yunis, in which more than 15 militants attempted to infiltrate the post. The attackers were repelled, but three soldiers were wounded, including one in serious condition from the Kfir Brigade’s 90th Battalion.\n“The military is investigating how the incident occurred,” Defrin said, while praising the soldiers who neutralized most of the assailants.\nProphetic Significance\nA Vision of a Land Without “Hamas”\nSome Bible prophecy teachers see the removal of Hamas from power as aligning with the promise in\nIsaiah 60:18:\n“Violence (‘Hamas’ in Hebrew) shall no longer be heard in your land, neither wasting nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.”\nIn Hebrew, the word translated as “violence” is ḥāmās, the same word used by the terror group’s name. For many, this passage offers a hopeful vision of a future where the land is free from terrorist violence, its defenses secure, and its gates marked by worship and peace. As Israel pushes deeper into Gaza City, some believe this could foreshadow the fulfillment of that promise.\nNetanyahu Approves Gaza City Offensive\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he had approved the IDF’s plans for the takeover of Gaza City, describing the operation as a “decisive stage” in Israel’s war effort.\n“We are at a decisive stage. I arrived today at the Gaza Division to approve the plans presented by the IDF and the Defense Minister for the takeover of Gaza City and the defeat of Hamas,” Netanyahu said. He emphasized that securing the release of hostages remains inseparable from the military campaign.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz, Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir joined discussions with IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir and senior officers on operational planning.\nZamir: Hamas Reduced to Guerrilla Force\nVisiting frontline troops in Khan Yunis, Lt.-Gen. Zamir said the IDF has already delivered a “severe blow” to Hamas.\n“From the terror army we experienced on October 7, it has become a guerrilla organization,” he told soldiers of the Kfir Brigade and 188th Armored Brigade. “We will continue to strike Hamas everywhere, pursue them as long as needed and wherever needed. Our missions remain the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas; we will not rest and we will not stop until we complete them.”\nHostage Talks and Ceasefire Proposals\nThe ground push comes as international mediators attempt to secure a hostage deal with Hamas. Egypt and Qatar have presented a framework that includes the release of 10 hostages in exchange for a 60-day ceasefire.\nIsraeli officials have not explicitly rejected the plan, though Netanyahu has stressed that Israel’s position remains the release of all hostages. “These two objectives–defeating Hamas and securing the release of all our hostages–go hand in hand,” the prime minister said.\nU.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told Fox News that President Donald Trump has insisted negotiations must not drag on. “This conflict must end immediately. Twenty hostages need to be returned to their families. Let’s just end this – bring peace and rebuild Gaza,” Witkoff said.\nHumanitarian Preparations\nAs the military maneuver begins, Israeli officials are coordinating with international aid organizations to manage the humanitarian fallout. Hospitals in southern Gaza are being expanded to absorb evacuees from the north, while additional field hospitals and the reopening of the European Hospital are under discussion.\nCOGAT, the IDF’s Coordination and Liaison Directorate for the Territories, confirmed agreements with humanitarian groups to bolster deliveries of medical supplies and ensure continuity of care during the offensive.\nSecurity sources say the IDF’s strategy is to isolate Hamas operatives inside Gaza City before moving to dismantle their networks.\n💡 Did you know?

Israel will dispatch negotiators to talks once a location is set, an Israeli official said.\nSpeaking to soldiers near Israel's border with Gaza, Netanyahu said he was still set on approving plans for defeating Hamas and capturing Gaza City, the densely populated centre at the heart of the Palestinian enclave.\nThousands of Palestinians have left their homes as Israeli tanks have edged closer to Gaza City over the last 10 days.\n\"At the same time I have issued instructions to begin immediate negotiations for the release of all our hostages and an end to the war on terms acceptable to Israel,\" he said, adding: \"We are in the decision-making phase.\"\nIsrael's plan to seize Gaza City was approved this month by the security cabinet, which Netanyahu chairs, even though many of Israel's closest allies have urged the government to reconsider.\nHis latest remarks underscore the Israeli government view that any deal ensures the release of all 50 hostages captured in Israel in October 2023 and still held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials believe around 20 are still alive.\nThe proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living hostages held in Gaza by Hamas militants and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\nOnce the temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining hostages.\nPALESTINIAN PROTESTSIn a sign of growing despair at conditions in Gaza, residents staged a rare show of protest against the war on Thursday.\nCarrying banners reading \"Save Gaza, enough\" and \"Gaza is dying by the killing, hunger and oppression,\" hundreds of people rallied in Gaza City in a march organised by several civil unions.\n\"This is for a clear message: words are finished, and the time has come for action to stop the military operations, to stop the genocide against our people and to stop the massacres taking place daily,\" said Palestinian journalist Tawfik Abu Jarad during the protest.\nThe Gaza health ministry said at least 70 people had been killed in Israeli fire in the enclave in the past 24 hours, including eight people in a house in Sabra suburb in Gaza City.\nA statement from the Palestinian Fatah movement said one of those killed in Sabra was a Fatah leader and former militant, along with seven members of his family. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\nCEASEFIRE OR CAPTURE OF GAZA CITY?\nEven as the military begins its preparations to launch the assault on Gaza City, Israeli officials have indicated that there is time for a ceasefire to be reached.\nOn Wednesday, the military called up 60,000 reservists in a sign the government was pressing ahead with the plan, despite international condemnation. Such a call-up is likely to take weeks.\nNetanyahu is under pressure from some far-right members of his coalition to reject a temporary ceasefire and instead to continue the war and pursue the annexation of the territory.\nSome Palestinian families in Gaza City have left for shelters along the coast, while others have moved to central and southern parts of the enclave, according to residents there.\n\"We are facing a bitter, bitter situation, to die at home or leave and die somewhere else. As long as this war continues, survival is uncertain,\" said Rabah Abu Elias, 67, a father of seven.\n\"In the news, they speak about a possible truce, on the ground, we only hear explosions and see deaths. To leave Gaza City or not isn't an easy decision to make,\" he told Reuters by phone.\nOn Thursday, Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee wrote on X that the military had started making what he said were initial warning calls to medical and international organisations operating in Gaza's north, telling them that Gaza City residents should start to prepare to move out of the city and towards the south.\nAdraee shared a recording of what he said was an Israeli officer telling a Gazan health ministry official that hospitals in southern Gaza should also prepare to receive patients from medical facilities in the north, who will be forced to evacuate.\nA Gaza health ministry official confirmed the phone call had taken place. The ministry rejected the Israeli request to shift medical resources south, warning it would cripple the already devastated health system and endanger over a million residents. It urged international bodies to intervene and protect lifesaving care.\nTwo more people have died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the ministry said on Thursday. The new deaths raised the number of Palestinians who have died from such causes to 271, including 112 children, since the war began.\nIsrael disputes malnutrition and starvation figures posted by the Gaza health ministry.\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo and Maayan Lubell and Lili Bayer in Jerusalem.

The plan has been condemned by the United Nations.\nThe statement signed by the foreign ministers of France, the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada, Japan and others says the planned settlement of the “E1″ area “brings no benefits to the Israeli people” but “risks undermining security”.\n“Unilateral action by the Israeli government undermines our collective desire for security and prosperity in the Middle East,” the signatories say.\nIsrael’s military has called up 60,000 reservists as part of its plan to capture and occupy Gaza City.

Strip, and that ordering more Palestinians to evacuate south would exacerbate the humanitarian crisis there.\n\"Israelis are sending messages to go to an area called Al Mawasi, which is west of Khan Younis, which is overwhelmed by 600,000 people who are displaced from Rafah, from Khan Younis, and every day this area is under Israeli attack,\" Shawa said.\n\"It's an unsafe area and there is no

of thousands of children.\n\"Instead of learning, children spend their time searching for water and food,\" the agency wrote on X, noting that this coming fall marks the third school year that pupils and university students will miss.\nIran launches naval exercises\nIran launched its first military drills since its 12-day war with Israel earlier this year, state media reported on Thursday.\nThe television report said that navy vessels were active in the Indian Ocean, launching missiles towards targets in the Gulf of Oman.\nSuch exercises are routine, but this most recent display is seen as a show of strength after Israel bombed a number of targets in the country, including nuclear sites.\nIranian naval vessels are also known to seize Western ships that stray into its waters following the breakdown of a 2015 nuclear deal that temporarily reduced tensions.\nGaza City offensive underway\nHundreds of thousands of civilians who had sheltered in Gaza City were ordered to evacuate and seek refuge in southern Gaza on Thursday morning as Israel began its ground operations in Gaza City.\nFor many, it is not the first time they have been displaced in recent months.\nThe military confirmed media reports that the offensive had begun, calling it the \"preliminary\" stage of a plan to control the entire city.\n\"We have begun the preliminary operations and the first stages of the attack on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding the outskirts of Gaza City,\" Brigadier General Effie Defrin, Israel's military spokesperson, said.\nIn January, international bodies estimated that aerial attacks had destroyed 70-80% of Gaza City.\nDefrin said that the city was still a \"stronghold\" for Hamas, the militant group whose October 7, 2023 terror attacks on Israeli civilians sparked

civilians in Gaza City.\"\nInternational bodies call for ceasefire to avoid further civilian deaths\nAhead of the Gaza City ground operation, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate halt of hostilities in light of the multiple humanitarian crises already affecting civilians there.\n\"It is vital to reach immediately a ceasefire in Gaza,\" to avoid the death and destruction that such an operation will cause, Guterres said from a conference in Japan.\nHe also slammed the \"illegal\" plan to expand the construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank.\nThe

late Wednesday that it would call up 60,000 reservists in light of the expanded operation in Gaza City. The plan also includes extending the period of service for the 20,000 reservists who have already been called up to active duty.\nThis is the largest call-up of reservists in months, and is seen as a sign that Israel will not give in to an international outcry to end the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, including what international organizations estimate to be 19,000 children.\nThe move, which is expected to receive the chief of staff's final approval soon, comes on the heels of mass rallies in Israel calling for a ceasefire and for the government to prioritize the release of hostages held by Hamas.\nWelcome to our coverage\nThe UN Security Council is scheduled to discuss the Israeli military operation and the humanitarian situation in Gaza this afternoon.\nOn Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had begun its ground assault on Gaza City, aiming to control the entire area.

      "text": "Israel's assault on Gaza City has begun — here's what you need to know\nIsrael is calling up tens of thousands of extra reservists as it prepares to send troops to occupy Gaza City.\nThe Israeli military said the first stage of its planned assault was already underway, with IDF troops moving into the outskirts of the city, which is currently home to more than 1 million people.\nIsrael describes the city as a Hamas stronghold, but it is also one of the last places of refuge of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians already displaced in almost two years of war.\nWhat's happened?\nIsrael's military announced the first steps of its operation to take over Gaza City on Wednesday and called up tens of thousands of reservists.\n\"We have begun the preliminary operations and the first stages of the attack on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding the outskirts of Gaza City,\"Israeli military spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin said.\nInitially, a military official briefing reporters earlier on Wednesday said reserve soldiers would not report for duty until September.\nBut after Israeli troops clashed with Hamas fighters in Gaza that same day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader sped up the timeline for taking control of Hamas \"strongholds\".\n\"We will deepen the attack on Hamas in Gaza City, a stronghold of governmental and military terror for the terrorist organisation,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe IDF said troops had already begun circling the outskirts of Gaza City and Hamas was now a \"battered and bruised\" guerilla force.\nHamas was quick to react to the latest fighting in Gaza City.\n\"Today's announcement by the terrorist occupation army of the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly 1 million residents and displaced persons … demonstrates … a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators,\" it said in a statement.\nWhat is Operation Gideon's Chariots?\nOperation Gideon's Chariots is the name the IDF has given to its plans to occupy Gaza City.\nIt could potentially see thousands of Israeli troops, some of them reservists, being sent into built-up areas where they have not previously operated.\nThe move into the city is the first step of a larger Israeli operation that aims to eventually expand to built-up refugee camps in central Gaza, as well as to Muwasi, a sprawling displacement camp along the coast.\nThose areas, along with the central city of Deir al-Balah, are the only parts of Gaza that have not been almost completely destroyed in previous Israeli operations.\nThe takeover plans in Gaza also include areas where Hamas may be holding hostages in tunnels or other secret locations, Israel says.\nWhere is Gaza City?\nGaza City is located on the Mediterranean coast, just over 75 kilometres south-west of Jerusalem, and is the largest city in the Gaza Strip.\nBefore the war, Gaza City was home to around 700,000 people.\nBut now, Israeli media reports the number of people there has swelled to about 1.2 million.\nThe majority of people who live in Gaza City are Palestinian refugees or descendants of refugees.\nThe serious escalation into Gaza City could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during the war.\nFearing an imminent Israeli ground offensive, thousands of Palestinians have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, now under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south in the shattered territory.\nIsrael currently holds about 75 per cent of the Gaza Strip.\nWhat are other countries saying about Israel’s actions?\nThe Israeli statements on Wednesday signalled Israel was pressing ahead with its plan to seize Gaza's biggest urban centre despite international criticism.\nIsrael's actions in Gaza have been condemned by the UN and more than 28 Western-aligned nations.\n\"It's pretty obvious that it will just create another mass displacement of people who have been displaced repeatedly since this phase of the conflict started,\" United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.\nLast month Western-aligned nations including Australia, Britain and Canada issued a joint statement condemning Israel's actions and saying the war \"must end now\".\nThe statement said \"the suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths\" and added that \"the Israeli government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable\".\nUS President Donald Trump restated his support for Israel in a post on his Truth Social website earlier this week.\n\"We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be,\" he wrote. \"Play to WIN, or don't play at all!\" Mr Trump said.\nWhere are ceasefire talks at?\nOn Monday, Hamas agreed to a ceasefire proposed by Qatar and Egypt.\nWhilst Israel has not yet responded, it continues to say it is committed to fully defeating Hamas.\nThe most recent proposals make slight modifications to an earlier ceasefire proposal advanced by the US and accepted by Israel.\nThe specific details of the latest proposal have not been made public, but Egyptian and Hamas officials have described the broad outlines:\n- A 60-day ceasefire in which Israeli forces would pull back to a buffer zone extending 800 metres into Gaza.\n- Hamas to release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others in phases.\n- Israel to release around 1,700 Palestinian prisoners, including 200 serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks.\n- Israel to allow 600 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza each day, a major increase that could help arrest what experts have described as the territory's slide toward famine.\n- During the temporary ceasefire, the sides would negotiate a lasting truce, the release of the remaining hostages and the further withdrawal of Israeli forces.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that while he will halt the fighting temporarily to facilitate the release of hostages, he will not end the war until Hamas has been defeated and disarmed.\nEven then, he says Israel will maintain security control over Gaza and facilitate the relocation of much of its population to other countries through what he describes as voluntary emigration.\nABC/wires"

The Prime Minister's office stated instead: \"Netanyahu has ordered the timetable for taking over the last terrorist strongholds and defeating Hamas.\"\nThe estimated death toll in the territory now exceeds 62,000 during the 21 months of Israel's response to the October 7 terror attacks, when militant groups from Gaza killed 1200 Israeli soldiers and civilians, whilst taking 240 hostage. After months of food aid restrictions and with no conclusion to the conflict in sight, 266 Gazans have now perished from starvation, 122 of those who starved to death have been children according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\nHamas, reacting to Israel's preparations to seize and control Gaza City, declared the offensive \"will fail, just as previous military operations have.\" Their spokesperson further stated that the assault \"aims to destroy the remaining foundations of life in Gaza.\"\nThe banned terror organisation continued: \"Netanyahu's disregard for the mediators' proposal and his failure to respond to it proves that he is the true obstructionist of any agreement, that he does not care about the lives of [Israeli captives], and that he is not serious about their return.\"\nIDF troops are already positioned close to the major city, with forces gathering in Jabalia and Zeitoun, where military spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin cautioned: \"We will deepen the damage to the terror infrastructure above and below the ground and sever the population's dependence on Hamas.\"\nThis proposed ground offensive will unfold in a city that has already been \"reduced to dust,\" according to one local who spoke to Al Jazeera. \"There is no form of life if we wish to return.\n\"We can't find water or homes, we can't even live in tents.\"\nIsrael's armed forces have indicated they will instruct all civilians to leave Gaza City and move to humanitarian areas in the south, where many of the Palestinian territory's two million displaced people are already taking refuge.\nIn this section of Gaza, analysis by BBC Verify and other organisations has revealed Israeli bulldozers and controlled demolitions flattening districts that previously housed tens of thousands of residents.\nNumerous allies of Israel have criticised the proposed occupation of Gaza City, along with Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategy for military control of the entire Gaza Strip, which surfaced following the collapse of ceasefire negotiations last month.\nFrance's President Macron declared on Wednesday that the offensive \"can only lead to disaster for both peoples and risks plunging the entire region into a cycle of permanent war\"."

There is also a growing movement of Israelis wanting to build settlements in Gaza.\nSettlers make up around 5% of Israel's population and 15% of the West Bank's population, according to data from Peace Now.\nSettlements are illegal under international law and have been condemned by the UN.

The city, located in the north of Gaza, is still one of the enclave’s most densely populated areas despite the continued danger of Israeli attacks and a growing humanitarian crisis. The service of 20,000 additional reservists already on active duty will also be extended.\n“We will be moving into a new phase of combat, a gradual, precise, and targeted operation in and around Gaza City,” a military official said during a briefing with reporters, according to Newsweek.\nThe call-up of reservists, the largest in months, is part of a plan approved by Defense Minister Israel Katz that aims to prevent Hamas from initiating future attacks or regrouping from its stronghold in northern Gaza.\n“I instruct you to use all tools and all power to strike the enemy until it is subdued, and to protect I.D.F. soldiers,” Katz told Israeli troops on Wednesday, according to a statement received by the New York Times. The plan is expected to receive final approval from the military’s chief of staff in the coming days.\nMeanwhile, the initial phase of the operation has begun, with Israel’s military spokesperson telling reporters on Wednesday that “already now IDF forces are holding the outskirts of Gaza City.” The newly called-up reservists will not report for duty until September.\nIsrael is moving ahead with plans even as it faces domestic and international criticism from its allies and risks displacing more Palestinians in Gaza. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also facing pressure from far-right members of his coalition to continue the war and annex territory.\nOne such member is Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said Wednesday that Israel had given final approval for the controversial E1 settlement development that would bisect the West Bank. The development essentially quashes optimism for a viable two-state solution or a future Palestinian state.\n“The Palestinian state is being erased from the table not with slogans but with actions,” Smotrich said on Wednesday. “Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea.”\nHowever, the impending move into Gaza City could be prevented under the Hamas-approved 60-day cease-fire plan put forth earlier this week. The proposal would see Israel pull back its forces to a buffer zone that extends 800 meters (or 875 yards) into Gaza, allow in 600 trucks of humanitarian aid per day, and free around 1,700 imprisoned Palestinians. In exchange, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 deceased hostages. Israel has said that there are still 50 hostages in Gaza, around 20 of whom are believed to still be alive. Israel is expected to respond to the cease-fire proposal by Friday.\nToday’s Most Read\n- Trump Has No Idea How to Do Diplomacy by Stephen M.

NATO defense chiefs held a discussion on Wednesday about what security guarantees they could offer Ukraine as part of a final deal to end the country’s more than three-year full-scale war with Russia. The gathering followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and European leaders, none of which resulted in a clear pathway to peace.\nThe meeting of 32 defense chiefs facilitated “great, candid discussion,” according to a post on X written by the chair of NATO’s Military Committee, Italian Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone. He also reaffirmed the group’s strong support for Ukraine.\nUkraine has asked for Western-backed military assurances to prevent any reinvasion from Russia down the line. Yet any such security guarantees would likely face stiff pushback from Russia, which has repeatedly said that having NATO countries’ troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday that attempts to resolve Ukrainian security without Russian involvement would not lead to movement toward a peace agreement.\n“We cannot agree with the fact that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation. This will not work,” Lavrov said at a news conference. He added that any talks not including Moscow are a “road to nowhere.”\nUndermined peace. Rwanda-backed M23 rebels killed scores of civilians in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in mid-July, according to a new report released Wednesday by Human Rights Watch. The report found that the killings took place only a few weeks after the signing of a U.S.-brokered preliminary peace deal between Rwanda and Congo. The investigation included witness accounts from medical staff, United Nations personnel, and attack survivors.\nM23 has denied involvement in the killings, and even with overwhelming evidence from the U.N., Rwanda has continued to deny backing M23.\nThe White House has hailed the peace deal, but these new details undermine Trump’s self-praise for ending the roughly 30-year conflict. Additionally, this report comes after M23 rebels suspended Qatari-brokered talks on Monday that were aimed at securing permanent peace and accused the Congolese government of attacking the group’s seized territories.\nDangerous return. More than 70 Afghans returning from Iran died in a bus crash in Afghanistan’s Herat province near the Iranian border on Tuesday night. The accident occurred on one of the country’s most dangerous highways when the bus collided with a truck and a motorbike. The bus was just one of the hundreds that have been carrying Afghan refugees across the border as Iran escalates expulsions and forced returns. The Herat province crossing is the main point of entry for the thousands of Afghans returning every day.\nMore than 1.9 million Afghan refugees have been returned from Iran and neighboring Pakistan since the start of 2025 as part of a push to remove undocumented nationals. The removals were particularly ramped up following the Israel-Iran war in June after Iran accused some refugees of spying for Israel. However, Afghanistan is not positioned to handle the massive population influx, and many returnees arrive with no jobs or places to live. The U.N. and humanitarian organizations have strongly condemned the deportations and warned that returnees face the threat of persecution and violence under Afghanistan’s Taliban government.\nOdds and Ends\nThe annual Air Guitar World Championships kicked off on Wednesday in Oulu, Finland, with competitors from 13 countries ready to face off to see who can rock the best air guitar solo. Since 1996, the competition has encouraged participants to “make air, not war,” believing that “climate change, wars, and all bad things will disappear when all people play air guitar.” It’s also a way to build connections with other air guitar aficionados and music. “A lot of the airheads in real life actually do play instruments,” U.K. contestant Piers Burnell told the BBC, “so it’s their way of kind of letting loose, and it doesn’t matter if they play a bum note because no one can hear it.”\nClaire Schnatterbeck is an editorial fellow at Foreign Policy.

      "text": "As Israel begins offensive on Gaza City, an exhausted military may face a manpower problem\nBy Tal Shalev, Tamar Michaelis, Oren Liebermann, CNN\nJerusalem (CNN) — As the earliest stages of a massive assault on Gaza City take shape, Israel is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.\nThe takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000.\nThose plans have sparked growing condemnation both internationally and domestically over fears that the spiraling humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza will worsen – and that the lives of the remaining hostages will be further at risk from an expanded military operation.\nThe Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Wednesday, in what he described as the first steps of the larger operation.\nMeanwhile, the Israeli military also said it has begun warning medical officials and international aid organizations in northern Gaza to plan for mass evacuation and displacement of the Palestinian population ahead of the planned Gaza City takeover.\nThe forced evacuation of the healthcare system risks worsening an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis gripping the besieged territory.\nAn Israeli military official told CNN that there will be “several steps” before Israeli ground forces move into the city. It is partially encircled by Israeli troops, the official said, and some forces are already operating in the area of Zeitoun, west of the city center. The IDF has begun preparing for the city’s evacuation by sending in more tents for displaced Palestinians, but evacuation warnings have not yet been issued.\nWhen Israel’s security cabinet first approved the takeover of Gaza City, Israeli officials estimated the plan could take five months or more. But on Wednesday, Netanyahu instructed the military to shorten the timeline.\nAfter nearly two years of war, and with no end in sight amid the next major operation, Israel’s military chief warned of the added burden on the troops, many of whom have been called up multiple times to fight in Gaza. IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet earlier this month that the military faced attrition and burnout, but his concerns were dismissed as Netanyahu and his coalition partners pushed ahead with the new war plans.\nA new survey from the Agam Labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested that approximately 40% of soldiers were slightly or significantly less motivated to serve, while a little more than 13% were more motivated. The findings underscore the stark reality facing Israel’s military, which could face limits to its manpower, especially as polls have repeatedly shown an overwhelming majority of the country supports an end to the war.\nMilitary leaders have called for the government to draft ultra-Orthodox men into service to supplement the beleaguered troops. But the vast majority of the ultra-Orthodox community has refused to serve, and at their demand, the government is pushing a broad exemption to mandatory military service. That this political debate is happening in the midst of war has only stoked the anger of many of those who serve.\nAfter the security cabinet approved the new operation, a small reservist organization in Israel renewed calls for soldiers to decline military orders to serve. “Your children do not know how to refuse on their own, because it is difficult. It is almost impossible,” Soldiers for Hostages said on social media earlier this month. Other reservist organizations have not publicly advocated for open refusal, which is more likely to be a private decision not to serve.\nThe IDF does not publish the numbers or percentages of reservists who do not show up when called.\n‘A death sentence for the hostages’\nAvshalom Zohar Sal has served more than 300 days in Gaza on four different deployments. His last deployment ended only one month ago, and he is no longer willing to return to the front line, especially to an operation in Gaza City\n“I’m a little in shock that we’re still talking about this war that was supposed to end a long time ago,” Zohar Sal told CNN.\nHe says the doubts, that began creeping in a year ago, have only grown stronger and other members of his unit have the same worries as him.\n“I think this decision is a death sentence for the hostages,” he said. “The government talked and said all the time that we’re talking about two missions for this war: to return the hostages and to defeat Hamas. Now it’s like telling us, there’s only one goal, which I believe is not achievable: to destroy Hamas. And even this won’t destroy Hamas.”\nThe Israeli military has a relatively small active-duty force, comprised mostly of conscripts. To continue fighting what has become the country’s longest war ever, Israel has to rely on reservists.\nBut it’s not clear what percentage will answer a new round of calls to serve inside Gaza once again, especially after the military chief warned the operation could endanger the soldiers and the hostages.\nDefrin, the military spokesman, tried to address those concerns Wednesday, saying at a press conference that the IDF uses “intelligence and many other capabilities” to protect the lives of the hostages. But all he could promise was that “we’ll do our best not to harm the hostages.”\nReserve call-up notices are mandatory for many, but after sending numerous reservists into Gaza multiple times, the military has shown little willingness to punish or prosecute those who decline or otherwise avoid the call.\nFormer IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, who led the military during the 2006 war with Lebanon, predicted not all the reservists would show up for duty.\n“I believe that some of them will stay home,” he told CNN at a protest by Air Force reservists earlier this month. “The war is over a year ago,” said Halutz, describing the current plan as having “no logic.” The retired general was careful not to call on Israelis to refuse to serve, but he encouraged reservists to “act according to his conscience, to his set of rules.”\nNetanyahu promised more than a year ago that the worst of the fighting would be over by now. He told CBS in an interview in February of last year that once Israel invaded Rafah in southern Gaza, “the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion, not months, weeks away from completion.”\nNow, 18 months later, Netanyahu says a new operation is the fastest way to end Israel’s longest war.\nBut that operation also targets a city that is home to more than a million people, many of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza.\nMore than 22 months since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks, over 2 million people in Gaza have been struggling with severe hunger, disease and displacement amid Israel’s siege.\nCases of child malnutrition have tripled across Gaza in “less than six months,” according to the United Nations, as humanitarian workers urged Israel to lift severe restrictions on aid entering the besieged enclave.\nNearly 1 in 3 children are malnourished in Gaza City, said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in what he called a “a man-made, preventable starvation”.\nNetanyahu’s government have repeatedly denied that starvation is rife in the enclave.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Israel currently holds about 75% of the Gaza Strip.\nMany of Israel’s closest allies have urged the government to reconsider, but Netanyahu is under pressure from some far-right members of his coalition to reject a temporary ceasefire, continue the war and pursue the annexation of the territory.\nOne far-right member, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, announced final approval on Wednesday of a widely condemned Israeli plan for a settlement project in the occupied West Bank that he said would erase any prospect of a Palestinian state.\nThe war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when gunmen led by Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities near the border, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages including children into Gaza, according to Israeli figures.\nOver 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air and ground war in Gaza since then, according to Gaza health officials, who do not say how many were militants but have said most of those killed have been women and children.\nHamas has accepted a proposal put forward by Arab mediators for a 60-day ceasefire that would involve releasing some of the remaining hostages and freeing Palestinian prisoners in Israel.\nThe Israeli government, which has said all the 50 remaining hostages must be released at once, is studying the proposal. Israeli authorities believe that 20 hostages are still alive.\nMany Gazans and foreign leaders fear a storming of Gaza City would cause significant casualties. Israel says it will help civilians leave battle zones before any assault begins.\nIsraeli troops clashed on Wednesday with more than 15 Hamas militants who emerged from tunnel shafts and attacked with gunfire and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City, severely wounding one soldier and lightly wounding two others, an Israeli military official said.\nIn a statement, Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades confirmed carrying out a raid on Israeli troops southeast of Khan Younis and engaging Israeli troops at point-blank range.\nIt said one fighter blew himself up among the soldiers, causing casualties, during an attack that lasted several hours.\nIsrael's military campaign has caused widespread devastation across the Gaza Strip, which before the war was home to about 2.3 million Palestinians.\nMany buildings including homes, schools and mosques have been destroyed, while the military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure, which Hamas denies.\nIsraeli officials have said evacuation orders would be issued to Gaza City residents before any force moves in.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees Gaza's only Catholic Church, located in Gaza City, said it received reports that neighbourhoods near the small parish had started to receive evacuation notices.\nHamas, an Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza for almost two decades, has been severely weakened by the war.\nHamas has said it would release all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to war. Israel says it will not end the war before Hamas disarms.\nOpinion polls show strong Israeli public support for ending the war if it ensures the release of the hostages, and a rally in Tel Aviv urging the government to pursue such a deal drew a huge crowd on Saturday.\nA new\npoll of Americans showed a 58% majority believe that every country in the United Nations should recognise Palestine as a nation."

      "text": "Israel prepares to launch its offensive at the gates of Gaza City\nThe government has called up 60,000 reservists while Netanyahu rejected the truce proposal accepted by Hamas and called for ‘seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds’\nThe plan for the Israeli occupation of Gaza City has begun. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed Wednesday morning the approval of the military project to occupy the largest municipality in the occupied Palestinian territories, where nearly one million people live in poverty. Hours later, military spokesman Effie Defrin confirmed that the first steps are already being taken. “We have begun preliminary operations and the first phases of the attack on Gaza City. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) already control the outskirts of the city,” Defrin said.\nA few minutes earlier Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to whom the army planned to present its plans for the takeover of Gaza City on Thursday, called in a statement for a shortening of the timetable “for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas,” creating a greater sense of urgency.\nSeveral political leaders have argued in recent days that this will be the definitive operation to bring about the collapse of the Palestinian militia, despite the fact that the IDF’s commander-in-chief opposed it days ago on the grounds that it puts the lives of Israeli hostages at risk.\nKatz gave the green light to the plan proposed by the military leadership during a meeting on Tuesday attended by the head of the Israeli army, Eyal Zamir — who was tasked with designing the offensive — and other senior military and intelligence officials. During that meeting, the leaders also approved the call-up of 60,000 reservists who are to enlist on September 2 to carry out the invasion of Gaza City. It is estimated that the total number of reserve soldiers who will be mobilized in the coming months to reinforce the Israeli army — not only to be deployed in Gaza, but also to swell the ranks of the troops coinciding with that operation — will reach 130,000.\nIsraeli leaders hope to empty Gaza City and push its population southward before October 7, a symbolic date as it will mark two years since the Hamas-led massacre of 1,200 people in southern Israel. From that point on, the Israeli plan is to surround the municipality and launch an offensive against Hamas in the area.\nCurrently, around one million people are surviving amid the rubble in Gaza City, according to estimates by the United Nations and other international organizations. This population is hungry and weakened after 22 months in which the Israeli government has subjected the entire enclave to a military offensive and the blockade of basic supplies. Humanitarian organizations and the UN have warned that the new offensive will have “catastrophic consequences” for the civilian population: not only because it will lead to more deaths — in the last two years, Israel has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians in the Strip — but also because it will encourage the separation of families and vulnerable people amid a chaotic exodus, distancing them from the few public services that remain intact.\nIsrael is continuing with its plans to occupy Gaza City despite Hamas’ acceptance on Monday of a truce proposal. The government of Qatar — one of the mediating countries in this phase of the conflict, along with Egypt — noted that the proposal accepted by the Palestinian party-militia is “almost identical” to one that Israel had already approved weeks ago, but Netanyahu’s administration has not yet clarified whether it will sign it. Senior Israeli officials have assured the press that the government is studying the text. In any case, the fact that Israeli officials are devoting their time to working on plans that run counter to a ceasefire dampens the prospects for a positive response.\nThe invasion of Gaza City also worries the families of Israeli hostages who remain in the hands of Hamas. Almost simultaneously with Katz’s announcement, the Forum of Families of the Captives and Missing issued a statement of condemnation: “Approving plans to occupy Gaza [City] when there is a proposal [for a truce] on the table for Netanyahu to approve... is a stab in the heart of the families,” the text reads. “The plan that should have been approved yesterday [Tuesday night] is the return of every captive.”\nThe Forum is demanding a meeting with the defense minister and the army chief to give them assurances that their loved ones will not be in danger as Israeli troops advance. The chief of staff is in a complicated situation: according to various Israeli media outlets, he has opposed the launch of the invasion in several meetings because he believes it puts the lives of captives that Hamas may be hiding in the area at risk. But the war cabinet led by Netanyahu is moving forward with the operation.\nPressure in favor of war\nThe continuation of the war comes amid calls from various ministers in Netanyahu’s government for the offensive to continue in order to keep the executive afloat. The latest to express this view was Orit Strook, Minister of Settlements and National Missions, who warned on Wednesday that her political party, Religious Zionism, would “probably” leave the coalition if the government took measures it did not like. “A right-wing government that implements left-wing policies has no right to exist,” Strook said.\nAlthough the plan to occupy Gaza City has not received final approval from the security cabinet, the Israeli press claims, citing anonymous sources, that the army is already beginning preparations for the offensive against the perimeter of Gaza City, especially in the Zeitoun neighborhood. This assessment fits with reports of the Gazan population fleeing the neighborhood for more than a week amid shelling. The Euro Med monitoring group recorded the start of these operations on August 11 and counted the exodus of tens of thousands of people and the demolition of 400 buildings, including private residences, during the first six days.\nAccording to Israeli representatives, Tuesday’s meeting between defense leaders addressed how to prepare the southern Gaza Strip for the arrival of those who will be expelled from Gaza City. These efforts would allegedly include field hospitals.\nThe Israeli leaders present at that meeting named the operation to take Gaza “Gideon’s Chariots B.” In May, the same leaders approved an operation called “Gideon’s Chariots” with the aim of controlling 75% of Gaza’s territory, which they hoped would be decisive in subduing Hamas and securing the release of captives. That did not happen. Months later, Israeli analysts warn that applying the same strategy now will not yield different results.\nThe Israeli army believes that Hamas has two brigades remaining in Gaza City. Israel reiterates that it wants total victory over the Islamist militia, but has not defined what that victory would entail. Since the beginning of the conflict, multiple reports suggest that Hamas and other Palestinian militias have been able to recruit new fighters. In May 2025, the Israeli army estimated that Hamas had about 40,000 fighters, a figure similar to what it had before the conflict.\nGaza City, the main population center in the Strip, had 650,000 inhabitants in 2021, according to figures from the Palestinian authorities. However, the military offensive launched by Israel on Gaza in October 2023 has caused successive forced displacements of thousands of people throughout the enclave over the past two years, making it very difficult to know how many people remain in Gaza City at this time. Even so, estimates from various international organizations suggest that the current population is close to one million.\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition\nTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\nFlechaTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

Effie Defrin confirmed on Wednesday.He said 60,000 conscription letters will be issued this week, with another 20,000 later this month, as Israel intensifies operations to dismantle Hamas strongholds.Defrin added that the army is working to secure evacuation routes and designated areas for civilians, allowing Gazans access to humanitarian aid and medical treatment.The announcement came hours after IDF soldiers repelled one of the largest Hamas raids in months.At least 18 terrorists emerged from a tunnel near Khan Yunis and opened fire with machine guns and RPGs, attempting to storm an IDF encampment.Ten of the attackers were killed in exchanges of fire and in airstrikes, while others fled back into the tunnel.Three Israeli soldiers from the Kfir Brigade were wounded in the battle, one seriously.Footage released by the IDF showed airstrikes and tanks targeting the attackers, including a scene in which a Hamas terrorist was neutralized at close range.Read Popularity surges for grueling pre-army preparatory academies for elite unitsPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz are expected Thursday to approve the military’s plan for the conquest of Gaza City.The meeting takes place amid a Hamas-backed proposal, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, for a partial deal that would involve a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living hostages.Netanyahu has ordered the timeline for operations to be accelerated.“Shorten the timeline for taking control of the last terrorist strongholds and defeating Hamas,” he said.Mediating officials told The Jerusalem Post the outline is close to an earlier framework accepted by Israel, with remaining gaps that “can be bridged within days.” Gaza CityIDFkhan yunis"

      "text": "On August 19, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) began the opening maneuvers of a new offensive aimed at uprooting Hamas from Gaza City. The first moves, with tanks and infantry, began after the Israeli security cabinet approved plans in mid-August for a new operation in Gaza. The goal is to expand on IDF gains that took place between May and July 2025 and move forces into Gaza City and possibly also the Central Camps area of the territory. The IDF has not controlled all of Gaza City nor the Central Camps during the war.\nThe Israeli offensive comes as hostage and ceasefire talks are ongoing. Although the new offensive in Gaza City has been critiqued abroad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it is necessary to defeat Hamas. Israel’s Ynet reported on August 19 that Israeli tanks had advanced into the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza City. The IDF was also reportedly operating in Zeitoun, a suburb of Gaza City that the IDF operated in several times in 2024.\nIsrael is calling up 60,000 reservists for the new operation in Gaza. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz approved plans for the occupation of Gaza City on August 19. The plan is dubbed Gideon’s Chariot II, an indicator of its intent to build on Gideon’s Chariots, the operation that began in May and seized around 75 percent of Gaza from Hamas. That effort primarily retook areas the IDF had already cleared and operated in during late 2023 and 2024. In many cases, the IDF had maneuvered into neighborhoods such as Beit Hanoun and then left them. Gideon’s Chariots aimed to secure and hold these areas.\nIDF Spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin said on August 20 that “from a military terrorist organization, [Hamas] has become a battered and bruised guerrilla organization.” Israel’s Prime Minister’s Office put out a statement the same day that noted, “Ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables—for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas—be shortened.”\nGaza City is a large urban area comprising numerous neighborhoods and a ring of suburbs that extend around northern Gaza. Around five IDF divisions are expected to take part in the new campaign. A similar number of divisions took part in Gideon’s Chariots and during intense periods of fighting in Gaza earlier in the war.\nHamas continues to try to carry out attacks. The IDF said on August 20 that 15 “terrorists fired both gunfire and anti-tank missiles and attempted to infiltrate a fortified position of the 90th battalion, Kfir Brigade, in the area of Khan Yunis. During the incident, the troops were able to eliminate ten armed terrorists in close-quarters combat, supported by Israel Air Force airstrikes.”\nIn Jabalia in northern Gaza, the IDF’s 162nd Division also continued operations. “As part of their activity, the troops are dismantling military infrastructures above and below ground, eliminating terrorists, and consolidating operational control in the area. This enables the expansion of the operation to additional locations and prevents terrorist organizations from returning to their positions,” the IDF stated.\nAs part of the prelude to the beginning of Gideon’s Chariots II, IDF Chief of the General Staff Eyal Zamir went to Gaza and met with the 36th Division. “You have been fighting for nearly two consecutive years, achieving unprecedented accomplishments that bring security to the communities near the Gaza Strip and to all the civilians of Israel. I am proud of you. The IDF bears the moral duty to bring the hostages home, both alive and fallen,” Zamir said."

Israel, though, wants all of them free and looks set to continue its campaign, with a military official saying it will call up 60,000 reservists. Another Israeli spokesperson says the offensive has already begun with troops controlling an area in the outskirts of Gaza City.

      "text": "Israel on Wednesday entered the first stages of its planned assault on Gaza City after approving a plan to take over the city that includes calling up 60,000 reservists for its expanded military operation in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\"We have begun the preliminary actions and the initial stages of the offensive on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding positions on the outskirts of Gaza City,\" Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters on Wednesday.\nHe added: \"We will intensify the strikes on Hamas in Gaza City, the political and military stronghold of the terror organization.\"\nDefrin also said that to \"minimize harm to civilians,\" the IDF will be warning citizens to allow them to evacuate.\n\"We are continuing to allow humanitarian aid for the residents of the Strip and are even expanding it — with additional central aid distribution points,\" he said.\nThe U.S. ally appeared to be pushing ahead Wednesday with a new phase of its war despite international opposition — and in the face of a renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has authorized the plans for the major new operation, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed to NBC News. It will also see an additional 20,000 reservists have their service extended, the Israeli military said.\nRead more on NBC News\nHundreds of thousands protest Gaza war as frustration grows in Israel about new offensive\nHamas accepts an Arab ceasefire proposal on Gaza as Palestinian death toll passes 62,000\nIsrael announces West Bank settlement that rights groups say could imperil Palestinian state\nThe assault is expected to force thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza to the south of the strip, which is suffering an intensifying hunger crisis under Israel's military offensive and aid restrictions.\nIn a Wednesday night statement, the Prime Minister's office said that \"ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables — for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas — be shortened.\"\n\"The Prime Minister expresses his great appreciation for the reservist fighters who have been mobilized and their families, and all IDF soldiers,\" the statement added. \"Together we will win.\"\nHamas did not issue an immediate response to the announcement about Israeli troops taking up positions outside Gaza City.\nScores of people have been killed by starvation in recent weeks, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave.\nIn addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated its own streets, with growing numbers of Israelis demanding an end to its offensive in the enclave.\nHundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.\nMeanwhile, Israel also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.\nCeasefire talks uncertain\nKatz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was on Tuesday holding a discussion to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.\nThe announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off Hamas' agreement to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free hostages who remain held in the enclave.\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.\n\"The ball is now in Israel's court,\" he said, adding: \"We would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians.\"\nAsked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be \"under immense pressure.\"\nAsked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said \"no\" and did not provide further clarification.\n'There is no safe place'\nNew satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel's advance, with the country's plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave's south condemned by rights groups.\nImagery captured on August 16 shows sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on August 9.Mohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again — just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel's offensive.\n\"Thank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,\" Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel's assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.\nThe family was able to live in their home for the past six months — but in the midst of Israel's plan to take over Gaza City they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza in an enclave where nowhere is considered safe.\n\"There is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,\" Abu Sharia said. \"My concern is to save the family's life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.\"\n\"Further displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.\n\"With more than 80 percent of Gaza already impacted by evacuation orders, it is unimaginable that civilians could be compelled to move to an even smaller area,\" it said.\nIsrael launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.\nSince then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, with much of the territory destroyed."

He previously served in Ukraine’s Secret Service and special forces, though it remains unclear if he was still active during the sabotage.\nSerhii was found at a hotel in San Clemente, Rimini, where he was on holiday with his family. Italian authorities apprehended him without resistance. He had entered Italy earlier in the week with a Ukrainian license-plated car and used his real identity, triggering an alert on police systems.\nAfter his arrest, Serhii was detained in Rimini before being transferred to a prison in Bologna. He denied the charges, claiming he was in Ukraine during the Nord Stream sabotage and stressing that his visit to Italy was for family reasons. He also opposed extradition to Germany, where he faces charges of collusion to cause explosions, anti-constitutional sabotage, and destruction of infrastructure.\nGerman prosecutors allege that Serhii was part of a group that planted explosives on the pipelines near Denmark’s Bornholm island. The attack, which severely damaged the Nord Stream pipelines, worsened Europe’s energy crisis. U.S. intelligence previously suggested a pro-Ukraine group was behind the sabotage, though no group has claimed responsibility.\nA decision on Serhii’s extradition is expected at a hearing on September 3, and he will remain in custody until then. Italy’s anti-terrorism prosecutors are also investigating a possible link between the Nord Stream attacks and the sinking of a Russian oil tanker off Savona in February.\nJoin Pulse+ to comment below, and receive exclusive e-mail analyses.\nshow less\nshow more\nBy Popular Demand.\nThe National Pulse Now has an on-site comments section for members.

Trump’s tariff policies could slash federal deficits by $4 trillion over the next decade. The CBO, Congress’s impartial fiscal analyst, shared these updated projections on Friday.\nIf President Trump’s tariff policies persist for the next 10 years, the CBO estimates a $3.3 trillion reduction in primary deficits. Furthermore, the increased tariff revenue would decrease the need for federal borrowing, cutting interest payments by $700 billion, collectively driving the total deficit reduction to $4 trillion.\nThese findings highlight the potential of Trump’s tariff strategy to significantly lower federal deficits and reduce dependence on borrowing, in addition to its primary goal of making American products more competitive against cheap, foreign goods produced in low-wage economies, encouraging the “reshoring” of jobs to the United States.\n“If there are no further changes in tariff rates, we project that customs duties from new and existing tariffs will total about $200 billion this fiscal year,” noted CBO Director Phillip Swagel.\nJoin Pulse+ to comment below, and receive exclusive e-mail analyses.\nshow less\nshow more\nBy Popular Demand.\nThe National Pulse Now has an on-site comments section for members.

Trump stated on Friday that Chicago, Illinois, will “probably” be the next city to see federal agents, officers, and troops deployed by his administration. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump criticized the city’s Democrat mayor, Brandon Johnson, calling him “grossly incompetent.”\n“Chicago’s a mess, you have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent,” the President told reporters. “And we’ll straighten that one out probably next. That’ll be our next one after this.”\nPresident Trump also mentioned that residents of Chicago, which saw close to 200 homicides and over 1,000 shootings in the first six months of 2025, are “screaming for us to come.” He further suggested a willingness to deploy the “regular military” to American cities, hinting that New York could follow Chicago in receiving federal assistance.\nThe National Pulse reported earlier on Friday that the America First leader has warned that increased federal control over Washington, D.C., is under consideration unless the capital city’s mayor, Muriel Bowser (D), and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) rectify falsified crime statistics.

Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), according to White House and Pentagon officials. The announcement did not include a specific reason for Kruse’s removal, though Congressional officials cited a “lack of confidence”—likely stemming from the leaked initial assessment of the U.S. military strikes against Iran’s nuclear program earlier this year.\nThe leaked assessment appeared to contradict President Donald J. Trump’s claim that the facilities had been “obliterated,” suggesting, instead, the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities had only a limited impact. This preliminary assessment has since been discounted by both other U.S. intelligence sources, as well as Israeli and independent analysis.\nThe DIA’s preliminary report, conducted just 24 hours after the strikes, was marked as “low confidence” and stated that Iran’s nuclear program had been set back only by several months. Pentagon officials later criticized the report for being incomplete and uncoordinated with the broader intelligence community. Subsequently, a criminal investigation was launched to uncover the source of the leak.\n“It was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike… it admits itself, in writing, that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment,” Hegseth told reporters following the leak.\nKruse had served as the agency’s director since February 2024 and was expected to remain until 2027.\nJoin Pulse+ to comment below, and receive exclusive e-mail analyses.\nshow less\nshow more\nBy Popular Demand.\nThe National Pulse Now has an on-site comments section for members.

He will continue in his current role at the White House until his confirmation as ambassador.\nPresident Trump praised Gor as a long-time friend and crucial ally in his administration, noting Gor’s work on Trump’s presidential campaigns, his involvement in publishing Trump’s bestselling books, and his leadership of a major Super PAC supporting the movement.\nTrump emphasized the importance of having someone he trusts in the ambassadorial role for the world’s most populous region, underscoring Gor’s ability to help advance the agenda of making America great again.\nTrump concluded by expressing confidence in Gor’s future success as an ambassador, stating, “Sergio will make an incredible Ambassador.

The release followed the expiration of a judge’s 30-day pause on his case. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee had ordered his release from a jail near Nashville, where he had been held since June after returning from El Salvador.\n“Today, Kilmar Abrego Garcia is free,” his attorney, Sean Hecker, said. Abrego Garcia had been deported to El Salvador earlier this year after being identified as a member of MS-13 by the Trump administration. Hecker claimed that the deportation and subsequent imprisonment were part of a “vindictive attack” and praised the courts for providing “meaningful due process.”\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, however, have indicated that they plan to re-arrest Abrego Garcia and begin deportation proceedings once he is no longer in the custody of the U.S. Marshals. The case has drawn significant political and media attention, including sympatheticsupport from U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and other Democratic members of Congress, as well as misleading stories from The Atlantic and POLITICO, which described the illegal immigrant as a “Maryland father.”\nAbrego Garcia was initially returned to the U.S. from El Salvador on human trafficking charges stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. He was later detained in Tennessee after being indicted on human smuggling charges. His lawyers hired a firm with court-approved pre-trial transportation experience to bring him back to Maryland after his release.\nBarack Obama-appointed U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis ordered that ICE must provide 72 hours of notice before initiating removal efforts.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has published transcripts and hours of audio from Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche’s recent interviews with Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted of trafficking children to deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in 2021.\nThe interviews, published on the DOJ website, were set up amid public backlash over the agency’s release of a memo suggesting Epstein had no “client list,” despite Attorney General Pam Bondi previously stating that such a list was “on [her] desk.”\nNewsletter\nNeed to Know.\nYour free, daily feed from The National Pulse.\nThank You!\nYou are now subscribed to our newsletter.\nMaxwell claims to Blanche that she was not aware of Epstein attempting to record or blackmail people, and repeats that “there is no list, there’s no client list.

Trump blasted Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) in a Truth Social post on Friday for providing “false and highly inaccurate crime figures.” Trump, who has temporarily federalized law enforcement in the American capital, warned of a “complete and total Federal takeover of the City” if the issue is not addressed.\n“Washington, D.C. is SAFE AGAIN! The crowds are coming back, the spirit is high, and our D.C. National Guard and Police are doing a fantastic job. They are out in force, and are NOT PLAYING GAMES!!! As bad as it sounds to say, there were no murders this week for the first time in memory,” Trump wrote. “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City! Washington D.C. will soon be great again!!!”\nThe National Pulse reported on Thursday that the MPD is being sued by a veteran of its homicide unit who alleges the capital city’s law enforcement leaders manipulated crime data by misclassifying murders as accidental deaths and suicides. Meanwhile, the D.C. Police Union, representing 3,000 officers, has expressed skepticism over the accuracy of crime statistics reported by the MPD. Union President Gregg Pemberton stated, “What we know, what our members know, is that we go call to call to call out on the streets at night, going from robbery to carjacking to stabbing to shooting, and we just know that crime is ubiquitous, and it’s all in every quadrant of the city.”\nNotably, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into allegations of manipulated crime data, following reports of a D.C. police commander being placed on leave over accusations of falsifying statistics. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro is leading the investigation, which may examine actions by multiple police officials.\nJoin Pulse+ to comment below, and receive exclusive e-mail analyses.\nshow less\nshow more\nBy Popular Demand.\nThe National Pulse Now has an on-site comments section for members.

The announcement was made during a press conference in Ottawa, Ontario.\nThe tariffs, initially imposed in March, included a 25 percent levy on a wide range of U.S. products, mostly falling under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Beginning September 1, these trade duties will end, though similar tariffs imposed on Canada by the United States will remain in effect as negotiations continue. However, Canada will maintain its 25 percent tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum.\n“As we work intensively with the United States, our focus is squarely on the strategic sectors,” Carney stated during the press conference. He also noted that President Donald J. Trump assured him in a phone call that removing tariffs would pave the way for further negotiations.\nA White House official described Canada’s decision as “long overdue” and expressed optimism about continued discussions on trade and national security concerns. The announcement comes as the USMCA, negotiated during Trump’s first term, is set for review later this year.\nCanada’s counter-tariffs, originally imposed by then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, targeted CA$30 billion (US$21.7 billion) worth of U.S. goods. The decision to ease tariffs follows a period of heightened tensions, during which Trump raised tariffs on Canadian goods to 35 percent, citing issues such as the continued flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and Canada’s lack of cooperation on the matter.\nJoin Pulse+ to comment below, and receive exclusive e-mail analyses.\nshow less\nshow more\nBy Popular Demand.\nThe National Pulse Now has an on-site comments section for members.

Israel currently holds about 75 percent of the Gaza Strip.\nMany of Israel’s closest allies have urged the government to reconsider the operation.\nThe war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian terrorists led by Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities near the border, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages including children into Gaza.\nIsrael responded with a military campaign aimed at freeing the hostages and dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities in Gaza.\nHamas has accepted a proposal put forward by Arab mediators for a 60-day ceasefire that would involve releasing some of the remaining hostages and freeing Palestinian prisoners in Israel.\nThe Israeli government, which has said all the 50 remaining hostages must be released at once, is studying the proposal. Israeli authorities believe that 20 hostages are still alive.\nMany Gazans and foreign leaders fear a storming of Gaza City would cause significant casualties. Israel says it will help civilians leave battle zones before any assault begins.\nISRAELI TROOPS, HAMAS FIGHTERS CLASH\nIsraeli troops clashed on Wednesday with more than 15 Hamas terrorists who emerged from tunnel shafts and attacked with gunfire and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City, severely wounding one soldier and lightly wounding two others, an Israeli military official said.\nIn a statement, Hamas’s Al-Qassam Brigades confirmed carrying out a raid on Israeli troops southeast of Khan Younis and engaging Israeli troops at point-blank range. It said one fighter blew himself up among the soldiers, causing casualties, during an attack that lasted several hours.\nIsraeli officials have said evacuation orders would be issued to Gaza City residents before any force moves in.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees Gaza’s only Catholic Church, located in Gaza City, said it received reports that neighborhoods near the small parish had started to receive evacuation notices.\nHamas, an Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza for almost two decades, has been severely weakened by the war.\nHamas has said it would release all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to war. Israel says it will not end the war before Hamas disarms.\nOpinion polls show strong Israeli public support for ending the war if it ensures the release of the hostages, and a rally in Tel Aviv urging the government to pursue such a deal drew a huge crowd on Saturday."

Please consider a tax-deductible donation.\nBy Dave DeCamp / Antiwar.com\nAbout 60,000 Israeli reservists will receive call-up orders that the Israeli military will issue tomorrow as it’s preparing for a major offensive on Gaza City, The Times of Israel reported on Tuesday.\nThe report said that reservists will have two weeks before they need to report for duty and that not all of them will take part in the offensive on Gaza City since some will replace IDF troops deployed in other areas of Gaza.\nThe Israeli military’s plans to take over Gaza City involve the ethnic cleansing of over 1 million Palestinian civilians from the area. Since civilians are expected to remain in the city after evacuation orders, the IDF is prepared to use artillery strikes as its means of forcibly moving them, according to Haaretz.\nWhile the IDF hasn’t yet launched its ground offensive, it has ramped up strikes on Gaza City in recent weeks with a focus on the eastern Zeitoun neighborhood. Thousands of Palestinians have already fled the area, and an investigation from Al Jazeera found that many of the Israeli attacks were hitting displacement shelters.\nOnce the city is taken over, the IDF plans to spend more than a year destroying it, similar to how it made the northern cities of Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia, and Jabalia uninhabitable. The IDF will demolish homes in Gaza City under the guise of “dismantling Hamas infrastructure,” but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously told a Knesset committee that the IDF’s destruction of homes would force Palestinians to leave Gaza altogether.\nThe idea of the Gaza City offensive is to force all the Palestinians to the south, and from there, Israel will pressure them to leave Gaza, but it remains unclear where they could go. Israel has reportedly been in talks with several countries on taking in a large number of Palestinian refugees, but so far, none have publicly committed to the idea.\nEditor’s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

No deaths have yet been reported.\nThe Israeli military said Wednesday it struck a number of Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon, including a missile launcher and a weapons storage site.\nBelgium's foreign minister has said he \"strongly rejects\" new sanctions imposed on the International Criminal Court by the US earlier on Wednesday.\n\"Belgium once again strongly regrets the new sanctions imposed by the United States against judges and deputy prosecutors of the International Criminal Court,\" Maxime Prevot wrote in a post on X.\n\"As with previous sanctions, Belgium reaffirms its unwavering support for the ICC, its independence and its staff,\" he wrote.\nItaly's foreign minister has become the latest top Western diplomat to condemn Israel's plan to build the E1 settlement in the occupied West Bank.\n\"The Israeli decision to proceed with new settlements in the West Bank is unacceptable, contrary to international law, and indeed risks definitively compromising the two-state solution, an objective for which the Italian Government continues to work with conviction and the utmost commitment,\" Antonio Tajani wrote in a post on X on Wednesday evening.\nTajani joins Germany, the UK and the Netherlands in condemning the settlement, which - if built - would effectively block the formation of a Palestinian state on contiguous territory in the West Bank.\nAn aid convoy operated by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) came under attack on Wednesday near the famine-hit Sudanese town of Mellit in North Darfur, the agency's spokesperson told AFP.\nThe incident came as several countries including the United States, Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Egypt voiced alarm at the worsening hunger situation in war-torn Sudan, calling for pauses in fighting to let in more aid.\nThree of the 16 trucks in the convoy -- which was carrying life-saving food assistance for vulnerable communities in Alsayah village -- were damaged and caught fire, said the WFP's Gift Watanasathorn, adding that all members of the convoy were \"safe and accounted for\".\n(AFP)\nMedical sources in Gaza have increased today's death toll, telling Al Jazeera Arabic that 76 Palestinians have now been killed by Israeli attacks since dawn.\nIsrael's extremist finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has threatened to resign from the government if Netanyahu agrees to a temporary truce with Hamas, according to Israel's Channel 12.\n\"If the prime minister goes through with the deal, I will make difficult decisions and resign from the government. I told the prime minister that,\" the news outlet quotes him as saying.\nNetanyahu is yet to officially respond to the Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a 60-day ceasefire and partial captive-release deal, which Hamas agreed to earlier this week.\nResignations by Smotrich and the other Religious Zionism cabinet ministers would likely bring down the government, triggering fresh elections.\nA pre-dawn US military raid in northwestern Syria early on Wednesday targeted and killed a senior member of the Islamic State group, a US official told Reuters.\nIt was the second known raid in northern Syria by US troops since former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December. The Islamist-led government that replaced him has pledged to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State and is part of an anti-ISIS alliance that includes the US-led coalition fighting the group.\nThe US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the raid killed a senior ISIS member who was seen as a candidate to be the leader of ISIS in Syria. No US troops were killed or injured in the raid, the official added.\nA Syrian security source and Syria's state-owned Al-Ikhbariya said the target was killed as he tried to escape.\nAnother Syrian source said the target was an Iraqi national and was married to a French national.\nIt was not immediately clear what happened to his wife. The Pentagon did not immediately have any public comment on\nthe reports.\n(Reuters)\nThe Netherlands' foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp has issued a statement condemning Israel's approval of the deeply controversial E1 settlement in the West Bank, writing that the project stands in \"clear violation of international law\".\n\"I condemn Israel's decision to advance its illegal E1 settlement plan, effectively splitting the occupied West Bank in two. Implementation of these plans constitutes a clear violation of international law and would make a future Palestinian state virtually impossible,\" he wrote in a post on X.\nHe continued: \"The Netherlands and the EU have long rejected such plans and the expansion of illegal settlements.

The Israeli government must reverse this decision.\"\nIsrael's far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to move ahead with the long-frozen project last week, proclaiming the settlement would \"bury the idea of a Palestinian state\".\nThe E1 project - which would see 3,400 homes built between East Jerusalem and Ma'ale Emunim - has been on hold for decades due to fierce international opposition. If built, the settlement would cut the West Bank in half, ending the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian territory.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) said on Wednesday it deplored the announcement by President Donald Trump's administration of new US sanctions against another four of its staff members - two judges and two deputy prosecutors.\n\"These sanctions are a flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial institution which operates under the mandate from 125 states parties from all regions,\" the ICC said in a statement.\n\"They constitute also an affront against the Court's States Parties, the rules-based international order and, above all, millions of innocent victims across the world,\" the court added.\n\"The ICC will continue fulfilling mandates in strict accordance with its legal framework, without regard to any pressure or threat.\"\n(Reuters)\nIsrael has entered the first stages of its planned assault on Gaza City after a clash with Hamas and already has a hold on the outskirts of the city, Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters on Wednesday.\nNorway’s soccer federation says it \"cannot remain indifferent\" to humanitarian suffering in Gaza and will donate any profits from an October 11 World Cup qualifying game against Israel to aid work there.\n\"Neither we nor other organisations can remain indifferent to the humanitarian suffering and disproportionate attacks that the civilian population in Gaza has been subjected to for a long time,\" Norwegian Football Federation President Lise Klaveness said in a statement Tuesday.\n\"We want to donate the proceeds to a humanitarian organization that saves lives in Gaza every day and provides active emergency aid on the ground,\" she said.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how much the Norwegian federation expected to earn through ticket sales for the match, which begin next week.\nThe Israeli military said it killed 10 Hamas fighters in a rare face-to-face battle after repelling a major attack near the Gaza Strip's southern city of Khan Younis on Wednesday.\nOver 15 militants emerged from tunnels and attacked an Israeli army post with gunfire and anti-tank missiles; one Israeli soldier was seriously injured.\nHamas claimed to have killed several Israeli soldiers in house raids and detonated a suicide bomber among rescue forces. Israel denied reports of a suicide attack or abduction attempts during the incident.\nThe assault was described as \"exceptional\" by Israeli media due to its scale and direct combat. Israel's Channel 12 claimed that the attack had been aimed at kidnapping soldiers.\nWhen contacted by AFP, the Israeli military denied \"that there was one or more suicide bombers among the Hamas militants, or that Hamas attempted to abduct IDF soldiers\".\nThe United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four more International Criminal Court judges or prosecutors including from allies France and Canada, in a new effort to hobble the tribunal including over actions against Israel.\n\"The Court is a national security threat that has been an instrument for lawfare against the United States and our close ally Israel,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.\nIsraeli army spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin will deliver statement to the press.\nIt comes after the military says 60,000 reservists will be called up for a new offensive that aims to occupy Gaza City and northern parts of the enclave.\nInternational aid groups say they have not yet been able to deliver shelter materials to Gaza despite Israeli authorities saying they have lifted restrictions on such supplies, and warn that further delays could cause more Palestinian deaths.\nAid organisations say Israel had in effect been blocking the delivery of materials for shelters for nearly six months, with tent poles previously listed among items Israeli authorities considered could have a military as well as civilian use.\n\"The United Nations and our partners have...not been able to bring in shelter materials following the Israeli announcement,\" the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), spokesperson Jens Laerke said.\n\"There's a set of impediments that still needs to be addressed, including Israeli customs clearance.\"\nThe Palestinian Authority on Wednesday slammed Israel's approval of a key settlement project in the occupied West Bank, saying it undermined the chances of a two-state solution.\nThe approval of the project in the area known as E1 \"fragments... geographic and demographic unity, entrenching the division of the occupied West Bank into isolated areas and cantons that are disconnected from one another, turning them into something akin to real prisons,\" the PA's foreign ministry said in a statement.\nU.S. forces took part in a pre-dawn raid in northwestern Syria early on Wednesday that targeted a member of the Islamic State group, a U.S. official and a Syrian security source said.\nA second Syrian security source and Syria's state-owned Al-Ikhbariya said the target was killed as he tried to escape.\nIt was not immediately clear who the Islamic State member targeted on Wednesday was.

Football must also take action.\".\nThe AIAC has written a formal letter to the Italian soccer federation, to be forwarded to European and world soccer’s governing bodies, calling for Israel to be suspended.\n\"The AIAC Board of Directors unanimously believes that, given the daily massacres, which have also resulted in hundreds of deaths among managers, coaches, and athletes … it is legitimate, necessary, indeed a duty, to place at the center of federation talks the request, to be submitted to UEFA and FIFA, for the temporary exclusion of Israel from sporting competitions,\" the letter concludes.\n\"Because the pain of the past cannot cloud anyone’s conscience and humanity.\"\nItaly is set to play Israel on neutral turf in Debrecen, Hungary on 8 September, before hosting the return match in Udine on 14 October.\n\"We could just focus on playing, looking the other way. But we believe that is not right,\" AIAC vice president Giancarlo Camolese said.\nYair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader, has slammed the Netanyahu government's decision to call up 60,000 reservists for the army planned offensive and takeover of Gaza City.\n\"60,000 reserve orders were issued this morning to realise the delusion of conquering Gaza,\" Lapid wrote on X.\nHis comments came after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz approved a plan to conquer Gaza City, an urban area home to hundreds of thousands of people in the north of the Palestinian territory.\nMost of the territory's population has been displaced since the war began, many repeatedly, according to the United Nations.\nAddressing Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at a meeting in Moscow, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said he hoped to discuss \"efforts to end the aggression on Gaza, and the massacres and starvation that it is creating.\"\nThis was in addition to the \"illegal measures that continue to undermine the two-state solution and kill all prospects for peace in the region,\" he added.\n\"We value your clear position against the war and your demand for reaching a permanent ceasefire,\" he told Lavrov.\nIsrael approved a major settlement project on Wednesday in an area of the occupied West Bank that the international community has warned threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state.\n\"I am pleased to announce that just a short while ago, the civil administration approved the planning for the construction of the E1 neighbourhood,\" the mayor of the nearby Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, Guy Yifrach, said in a statement.\nAt least 62,122 people have been killed and more than 156,700 injured in Gaza since the start of the Israeli offensive on 7 October 2023, Gaza's health ministry said Wednesday.\nThe casualties include 2,018 deaths and 14,947 injuries of people seeking aid since late May.\nHealth officials in Gaza say the majority of casualties are civilians, with thousands more believed to be buried beneath the rubble.\n59 percent of Americans believe Israel's military response in Gaza after Hamas' 7 October 2023 attack has been excessive, a poll by Reuters and Ipsos has found.\nThe poll shows that 65 percent of Americans believe the US should take action in Gaza to help people facing starvation, as a result of Israel's earlier blockade and now restrictions on aid.\nThe German government said Wednesday it \"rejects the escalation\" of Israel's campaign in Gaza after Israel approved a plan to conquer Gaza City and authorised calling up around 60,000 reservists.\nGermany finds it \"increasingly difficult to understand how these actions will lead to the freeing of all the hostages, or to a ceasefire,\" government spokesman Steffen Meyer told reporters.\nPope Leo plans to visit Lebanon, the country's senior Catholic official announced on Wednesday, in what could be the first visit outside Italy by the new leader of the global Church.\nThe pope will travel to Lebanon \"by December\", Cardinal Bechara Rai told the Al Arabiya television channel.\nRai, leader of the 3.5-million-member Maronite Catholic Church, did not give a specific date for the visit but said \"preparations are already underway\".\nA Lebanese official familiar with the matter confirmed that discussions were being held about a visit towards the end of the year, though a date had not yet been finalised.\nPope Leo XIV asked people to fast on Friday to pray for peace and justice in the Middle East and Ukraine, issuing a special appeal as he returned to the Vatican from summer vacation.\nAt the end of his weekly general audience Wednesday, Leo recalled that Friday is a special feast day dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

He cited Lebanon's need for the force to help \"maintain security and stability in the south\" and to support the army following the government's decision to increase troop numbers there to 10,000 personnel.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday that he treats leaders of other countries with respect after his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu attacked him over his decision to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\"I don't take these things personally, I engage with people diplomatically. He has had similar things to say about other leaders,\" Albanese said during a media briefing.\nNetanyahu's personal attack on Albanese has further strained relations between the two countries. Ties soured after Australia decided last week to conditionally recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September.\nAlbanese told reporters that he had informed Netanyahu about Australia's decision to support a Palestinian state before his centre-left government formally announced the plan.\nQatar has expressed some optimism for a new ceasefire proposal, noting it was \"almost identical\" to an earlier version agreed to by Israel, reports AFP.\nQatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said on Tuesday that Hamas had given a \"very positive response.\"\n\"We cannot make any claims that a breakthrough has been made. But we do believe it is a positive point,\" he added.\nAn Israeli military official said on Wednesday that the country’s top generals had approved plans to begin a new phase of operations in some of Gaza’s most densely populated areas.\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to speak publicly, the official said that the military will be operating in parts of Gaza City where the Israeli military has not yet operated and where he claimed Hamas is still active.\nThe official said after receiving approval from military leaders, the plan would now progress toward the final approval stage.\nIt remains unclear when the operation will begin. The official said 50,000 reservists will be called up in the coming month, nearly doubling the number of active reservists to 120,000."

Israeli troops have moved into the outskirts, including Zeitoun and Jabalia, after days of heavy bombardment. Defence Minister Israel Katz has approved the operation, with 60,000 reservists to be called up in September, reports BBC. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was “shortening the timelines” to capture what he called Hamas’s “last strongholds.”\nThe escalation has drawn sharp international criticism. UN Secretary General António Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire, while the Red Cross warned that further displacement and hostilities could “worsen an already catastrophic situation” for Gaza’s 2.1 million people.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron cautioned that Israel’s plan “can only lead to disaster for both peoples.” Hamas accused Israel of waging a “brutal war against innocent civilians” and ignoring a new ceasefire proposal from mediators Qatar and Egypt, who have suggested a 60-day truce and a partial hostage release. Israel has yet to respond formally, saying it seeks a comprehensive deal, reports BBC. The UN estimates evacuation orders now cover 86% of Gaza. Humanitarian agencies warn that continued offensives risk deepening the crisis for civilians and the roughly 50 hostages still held by Hamas."

      "text": "Jerusalem: As the earliest stages of a massive assault on Gaza City take shape, Israel is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.\nThe takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000, reports CNN.\nThe Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Wednesday, in what he described as the first steps of the larger operation.\nWhen the security cabinet first approved the takeover of Gaza City, Israeli officials estimated the plan could take five months or more. But on Wednesday, Netanyahu instructed the military to shorten the timeline.\nAfter nearly two years of war, and with no end in sight amid the next major operation, Israel’s military chief warned of the added burden on the troops, many of whom have been called up multiple times to fight in Gaza.\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet earlier this month that the military faced attrition and burnout, but his concerns were dismissed as Netanyahu and his coalition partners pushed ahead with the new war plans.\nA new survey from the Agam Labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested that approximately 40 percent of soldiers were slightly or significantly less motivated to serve, while a little more than 13 percent were more motivated. The findings underscore the stark reality facing Israel’s military, which could face limits to its manpower, especially as polls have repeatedly shown an overwhelming majority of the country supports an end to the war.\nMilitary leaders have called for the government to draft ultra-Orthodox men into service to supplement the beleaguered troops. But the vast majority of the ultra-Orthodox community has refused to serve, and at their demand, the government is pushing a broad exemption to mandatory military service. That this political debate is happening in the midst of war has only stoked the anger of many of those who serve.\nAfter the security cabinet approved the new operation, a small reservist organization in Israel renewed calls for soldiers to decline military orders to serve.\n“Your children do not know how to refuse on their own, because it is difficult. It is almost impossible,” Soldiers for Hostages said on social media earlier this month.\nOther reservist organizations have not publicly advocated for open refusal, which is more likely to be a private decision not to serve.\nThe IDF does not publish the numbers or percentages of reservists who do not show up when called.\nThe Israeli military has a relatively small active-duty force, comprised mostly of conscripts. To continue fighting the country’s longest war ever, Israel has to rely on reservists.\nBut it’s not clear what percentage will answer a new round of calls to serve inside Gaza once again, especially after the military chief warned the operation could endanger the soldiers and the hostages.\nDefrin, the military spokesman, tried to address those concerns Wednesday, saying at a press conference that the IDF uses “intelligence and many other capabilities” to protect the lives of the hostages. But all he could promise was that “we’ll do our best not to harm the hostages.\nReserve call-up notices are mandatory for many, but after sending numerous reservists into Gaza multiple times, the military has shown little willingness to punish or prosecute those who decline or otherwise avoid the call.\nIn an interview in February of last year, Netanyahu had promised more than a year ago that the worst of the fighting would be over by now. However, 18 months later, Netanyahu says a new operation is the fastest way to end Israel’s longest war."

The assault has already displaced nearly one million Palestinians and involved what rights groups describe as “systematic demolitions” of homes.\nHamas has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of ignoring mediation efforts for a ceasefire and pressing ahead with the military takeover of Gaza City.\nAt the same time, world leaders have strongly condemned Israel’s decision to move forward with the controversial E1 settlement expansion project in the occupied West Bank. The project would cut one of the last remaining links between Ramallah and Bethlehem, further deepening international concerns about the future of a two-state solution.\nOn Wednesday alone, Israeli attacks killed at least 81 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip. According to Gaza’s health ministry, Israel’s ongoing war has so far killed at least 62,122 people and wounded 156,758 others.\nThe conflict began after the October 7 attacks, in which 1,139 people were killed in Israel and over 200 were taken captive."

They included three children and their parents whose home in the Badr area of Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, was bombed, it said.\nDefrin said the IDF was also doing everything possible to prevent harm to the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive. Their families have expressed fears that those in Gaza City could be endangered by a ground offensive.\nThe ICRC warned of a catastrophic situation for both Palestinian civilians and the hostages if military activity in Gaza intensified.\n\"After months of relentless hostilities and repeated displacement, the people in Gaza are utterly exhausted. What they need is not more pressure, but relief. Not more fear, but a chance to breathe. They must have access to the essentials to live in dignity: food, medical and hygiene supplies, clean water, and safe shelter,\" a statement said.\n\"Any further intensification of military operations will only deepen the suffering, tear more families apart, and threaten an irreversible humanitarian crisis.

Israel currently holds about 75% of the Gaza Strip.\nMany of Israel's closest allies have urged the government to reconsider, but Netanyahu is under pressure from some far-right members of his coalition to reject a temporary ceasefire, continue the war and pursue the annexation of the territory.\nOne far-right member, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, announced final approval on Wednesday of a widely condemned Israeli plan for a settlement project in the occupied West Bank that he said would erase any prospect of a Palestinian state.\nThe war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when gunmen led by Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities near the border, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages including children into Gaza, according to Israeli figures.\nOver 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air and ground war in Gaza since then, according to Gaza health officials, who do not say how many were Hamas fighter but have said most of those killed have been women and children.\nHamas has accepted a proposal put forward by Arab mediators for a 60-day ceasefire that would involve releasing some of the remaining hostages and freeing Palestinian prisoners in Israel.\nThe Israeli government, which has said all the 50 remaining hostages must be released at once, is studying the proposal.

It said one fighter blew himself up among the soldiers, causing casualties, during an attack that lasted several hours.\nIsrael's military campaign has caused widespread devastation across the Gaza Strip, which before the war was home to about 2.3 million Palestinians. Many buildings including homes, schools and mosques have been destroyed, while the military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure, which Hamas denies.\nIsraeli officials have said evacuation orders would be issued to Gaza City residents before any force moves in.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees Gaza's only Catholic Church, located in Gaza City, said it received reports that neighbourhoods near the small parish had started to receive evacuation notices.\nHamas, an Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza for almost two decades, has been severely weakened by the war.\nHamas has said it would release all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to war. Israel says it will not end the war before Hamas disarms.\nOpinion polls show strong Israeli public support for ending the war if it ensures the release of the hostages, and a rally in Tel Aviv urging the government to pursue such a deal drew a huge crowd on Saturday.\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll of Americans showed a 58% majority believe that every country in the United Nations should recognise Palestine as a nation.\nComments"

      "text": "GAZA CITY — The Israeli military said on Wednesday it has initiated the first steps of a major military campaign to take over Gaza City. Hamas strongly condemned this decision, and it raised doubts about the future of ceasefire talks that are still going on.\nBrigadier General Effie Defrin, a spokesperson for the Israeli military, said in a statement that forces are already working on the edges of the city, which he called a “stronghold” for the terrorist group. Defrin said that Hamas is now a “battered and bruised” guerilla army. Defense Minister Israel Katz has given the go-ahead for the enlarged operation, which will call up 60,000 reservists and keep 20,000 active-duty soldiers on duty longer.\nHamas said the news showed “a blatant disregard for the efforts made by the mediators” to reach a settlement for a truce and the release of hostages. The militant organization said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “obstructing” any deal to keep up the “brutal war against innocent civilians in Gaza City.”\nThe fresh attack comes at a very important time for peace talks. Reports say that Hamas agreed to a ceasefire agreement on Monday that would stop the fighting for 60 days and free at least 10 living Israeli detainees and some dead bodies. But Israel hasn’t publicly said anything about the arrangement yet, and some officials are said to be insisting that all remaining hostages be freed.\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing almost 1,200 people and taking 251 people captive. This started the battle. The Gaza health ministry says that since then, Israel’s military assaults in Gaza have killed more than 62,000 Palestinians. The Israeli military said that 27 of the initial 251 hostages are dead and 49 are still thought to be in Gaza.\nIsrael also given the go-ahead for a controversial settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would practically split the territory in two. Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister, praised the decision as a measure to “erase” the idea of a future Palestinian state. He said, “Every settlement, every neighborhood, every housing unit is another nail in the coffin of this dangerous idea.”"

There is also a growing movement of Israelis wanting to build settlements in Gaza.\nSettlers make up around 5% of Israel’s population and 15% of the West Bank’s population, according to data from Peace Now.\nSettlements are illegal under international law and have been condemned by the UN. They are, however, authorised by the Israeli government."

      "bias": "unknown",
      "text": "Israel’s Gaza City Offensive: The Final Mask of Pretext Slips Away\nThe mask has finally slipped completely. Israel’s military announced this week that it has begun “preliminary actions” for a ground offensive to capture and occupy all of Gaza City, confirming what honest observers understood from the beginning: this was never about rescuing hostages or defeating Hamas. This is the completion of a decades-long project to seize total control of Gaza and the West Bank, using October 7th as the pretext for ethnic cleansing that was always the ultimate objective.\nDefence Minister Israel Katz’s approval of the Gaza City operation, scheduled for security cabinet approval this week, represents the formalisation of conquest disguised as counterterrorism. With 60,000 reservists being called up and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians facing forced evacuation orders, we witness not military necessity but the systematic implementation of territorial annexation through population displacement.\nThe Israeli Defence Forces already control Gaza City’s outskirts, with troops operating in the Zeitoun and Jabalia areas under the euphemistic banner of “laying groundwork” for operations. Brigadier General Effie Defrin’s promise to “sever the population’s dependence on Hamas” reveals the true agenda: not eliminating a terrorist organisation but destroying Palestinian self-governance entirely to facilitate permanent Israeli control.\nThe Humanitarian Catastrophe\nThe deliberately engineered humanitarian crisis serves conquest’s purposes perfectly. International Committee of the Red Cross warnings about “catastrophic situations” for Gaza’s 2.1 million residents miss the point entirely; the catastrophe is not unfortunate consequence but calculated strategy. When civilian populations face starvation, disease, and constant displacement, they become easier to eliminate or expel.\nTwenty-five Palestinians died in Israeli strikes Wednesday alone, including entire families bombed in refugee camps. These aren’t tragic miscalculations but systematic applications of collective punishment designed to make Gaza uninhabitable for Palestinians while creating space for Israeli settlement and control.\nOn Wednesday Hamas accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of disregarding the mediators’ ceasefire proposal and said he was the “real obstructionist of any agreement”, according to a statement cited by Reuters.\nThe manufactured concern for the 50 remaining hostages,20 believed alive, provides perfect justification for operations that endanger those same hostages. The Israeli government rejected partial hostage release deals not from concern for captives’ welfare but because peace would interrupt the conquest schedule. Total victory requires total war, and total war requires rejecting any settlement that might preserve Palestinian presence.\nThe best thing Hamas could do, and to be fair, should have done a long time ago is release the hostages…\nInternational Complicity Through Performative Opposition\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron’s warning that the offensive “can only lead to disaster” exemplifies the international community’s choreographed response: express concern, avoid action, enable continuation. European leaders understand perfectly that this operation aims at permanent territorial control, yet their “condemnation” serves only to provide diplomatic cover for Israeli actions through the appearance of international oversight.\nThe Qatar and Egypt mediation efforts, presenting 60-day truce proposals that Hamas has accepted, function as theatrical exercises designed to demonstrate Palestinian intransigence when Israel inevitably rejects reasonable terms. The requirement for “comprehensive” rather than partial deals ensures that no agreement can satisfy Israeli demands, providing justification for continued military operations.\nThe October 7th Pretext Dissolves\nAfter 22 months of systematic destruction, the initial justification for military action has evaporated entirely. Hamas stands “battered and bruised” according to Israeli military spokespersons, its governmental and military infrastructure largely destroyed. If this were genuinely about security threats or terrorist capabilities, the mission would be complete.\nInstead, we witness escalation precisely when the stated objectives have been achieved. The shift from targeting Hamas to “severing population dependence” reveals conquest’s true nature. The goal was never eliminating terrorism but eliminating Palestinian presence, using terrorist threats as convenient justification for ethnic cleansing.\nThe victims on the Israeli side, the 1,200 killed and 251 taken hostage on October 7th, provided the emotional and political capital necessary to launch operations. The attacks created the permissive environment for implementing territorial expansion that previous governments could only dream about executing. From that day to this, every action has been condoned as an act of defence. backed by every Western government, all knowing this could only end this way…\nThe Endgame Revealed\nGaza City’s conquest represents merely the latest phase in systematic Palestinian dispossession that began with the 1948 Nakba and continues through daily settlement expansion, house demolitions, and administrative absorption of Palestinian territory. The current operations complete the transformation of Gaza from besieged enclave to occupied territory, matching the West Bank’s gradual annexation through settlement growth and military control.\nIsraeli officials no longer bother hiding their territorial ambitions because international enabling has removed the need for subterfuge. When Western governments provide unlimited military aid while expressing token concerns about civilian casualties, they signal that conquest enjoys implicit approval provided sufficient rhetorical distance is maintained.\nThe Israeli military’s announcement of Gaza City operations marks not escalation but culmination. Everything that has occurred since October 7th, the systematic destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of populations, the elimination of governmental capacity, the rejection of ceasefire proposals, has led to this moment when conquest can be completed under legal and diplomatic cover.\nThe tragedy for Palestinians extends beyond immediate military operations to the international abandonment that makes such operations possible. When the “international community” provides weapons while expressing concerns, when “mediators” propose solutions designed to fail, when “allies” condemn actions while enabling their continuation, the victim population faces not merely military occupation but systematic international betrayal.\nThe 62,122 Palestinians killed since October 7th represent not collateral damage but strategic depopulation, each death contributing to the broader project of making Palestinian presence untenable while creating space for Israeli control. The numbers that international organisations quote as evidence of humanitarian catastrophe become, from conquest’s perspective, measures of successful implementation.\nFor those who still believed that international law, humanitarian norms, or democratic values might constrain Israeli actions, the Gaza City operation provides definitive evidence of their irrelevance when they conflict with imperial objectives. The mask hasn’t slipped; it’s been deliberately removed because pretence no longer serves any purpose.\nThe final act of Palestinian dispossession from Gaza proceeds with methodical efficiency, international enabling, and comprehensive impunity. What remains is not whether this conquest will succeed, it already has, but whether anyone retains sufficient moral courage to name it accurately rather than hiding behind euphemisms about security operations and terrorist threats.\nThe reckoning with what we have witnessed, enabled, and failed to prevent lies ahead. History will record not merely what Israel did to Gaza, but what the world did to Palestinians by ensuring they faced their destruction entirely alone.\nSupport Independent Journalism Today\nOur unwavering dedication is to provide you with unbiased news, diverse perspectives, and insightful opinions.

Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) August 20, 2025\nThe Israeli statements signalled Israel was pressing ahead with its plan to seize the Gaza' Strip's biggest urban centre despite international criticism of an operation likely to force the displacement of many more Palestinians.\nDefrin said troops were already operating on the outskirts of Gaza City, and Hamas was now a \"battered and bruised\" guerrilla force.\n\"We will deepen the attack on Hamas in Gaza City, a stronghold of governmental and military terror for the terrorist organisation,\" the spokesman said.\nIsrael currently holds about 75 per cent of the Gaza Strip.\nMany of Israel's closest allies have urged the government to reconsider but Netanyahu is under pressure from some ultranationalist members of his coalition to reject a temporary ceasefire, continue the war and pursue the annexation of the territory.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced final approval on Wednesday of a widely condemned Israeli plan for a settlement project in the occupied West Bank that he said would erase any prospect of a Palestinian state.\nThe war in the Gaza Strip began on October 7, 2023, when gunmen led by Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities near the border, killing about 1200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages including children into the enclave, according to Israeli figures.\nMore than 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air and ground war in the Gaza Strip since then, according to Gazan health officials, who do not say how many were militants but have said most of those killed have been women and children.\nHamas has accepted a proposal put forward by Arab mediators for a 60-day ceasefire that would involve releasing some of the remaining hostages and freeing Palestinian prisoners in Israel.\nThe Israeli government, which has said all the 50 remaining hostages must be released at once, is studying the proposal.\nIsraeli authorities believe that 20 hostages are still alive.\nMany Gazans and foreign leaders fear a storming of Gaza City would cause significant casualties.\nIsrael says it will help civilians leave battle zones before any assault begins.\nIsraeli troops clashed on Wednesday with more than 15 Hamas militants who emerged from tunnel shafts and attacked with gunfire and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City, severely wounding one soldier and lightly wounding two others, an Israeli military official said.\nIn a statement, Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades confirmed carrying out a raid on Israeli troops southeast of Khan Younis and engaging Israeli troops at point-blank range.\nIt said one fighter blew himself up among the soldiers, causing casualties, during an attack that lasted several hours."

      "text": "The Shifting Sands of Conflict: How Israel’s Gaza Offensive Signals a New Era of Regional Instability\nOver 60,000 Israeli reservists are being mobilized as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initiates the first phase of a ground operation in Gaza. While immediate attention focuses on the unfolding military actions, a deeper analysis reveals this isn’t simply a continuation of existing conflict, but a potential inflection point with far-reaching consequences for regional security and the future of asymmetric warfare. **Gaza** is becoming a testing ground for new military doctrines and a catalyst for escalating geopolitical tensions.\nBeyond the Immediate Offensive: The Rise of ‘Limited War’ Doctrines\nThe current operation, framed as a phased approach, suggests a deliberate shift away from large-scale, protracted conflicts towards what military strategists are calling “limited war” doctrines. This isn’t about a lack of resolve, but a recognition of the constraints imposed by international pressure, domestic political considerations – including the reported reluctance of some reservists to participate – and the evolving nature of modern warfare. The IDF’s strategy appears to be focused on surgically targeting Hamas infrastructure while attempting to minimize civilian casualties, a difficult balance that will be intensely scrutinized.\nThe Reservist Dilemma: A Cracking Foundation of National Service?\nReports of increasing reluctance among Israeli reservists to participate in prolonged military engagements are particularly noteworthy. This isn’t simply about individual opposition to the conflict; it reflects a growing societal fatigue with continuous mobilization and a questioning of the long-term strategic goals. This trend, if it continues, could fundamentally alter Israel’s security model, which has historically relied heavily on a robust reserve force. The implications extend beyond Israel, potentially signaling a broader global trend of declining public support for prolonged military interventions.\nThe Geopolitical Ripple Effect: Iran, Hezbollah, and the Widening Conflict Zone\nThe Gaza offensive cannot be viewed in isolation. It’s inextricably linked to the broader geopolitical landscape, particularly the escalating tensions with Iran and its proxy forces, such as Hezbollah. A prolonged conflict in Gaza increases the risk of a multi-front war, potentially drawing in other regional actors and destabilizing the entire Middle East. The possibility of coordinated attacks by Iran-backed militias against U.S. interests in the region is also a significant concern.\nThe Role of Emerging Technologies: Drones, AI, and the Future Battlefield\nThis conflict is also likely to be a proving ground for emerging military technologies. We can expect to see increased reliance on drones for surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeted strikes. Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a growing role in analyzing battlefield data, identifying targets, and automating defensive systems. The use of these technologies raises ethical concerns about autonomous weapons systems and the potential for unintended consequences, but their deployment is almost inevitable.\n| Key Metric | Current Status | Projected Impact (Next 6 Months) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Israeli Reservist Mobilization | 60,000+ | Potential increase to 300,000+ depending on escalation |\n| Regional Conflict Risk | High | Increased probability of multi-front war (30-40%) |\n| Use of Drone Technology | Significant | Further integration into offensive and defensive strategies |\nThe Humanitarian Crisis and the Erosion of International Norms\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is already dire, and a full-scale ground offensive will undoubtedly exacerbate the crisis. The potential for widespread civilian casualties and displacement raises serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law. The erosion of these norms not only undermines the principles of a rules-based international order but also creates a breeding ground for radicalization and future conflict.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the Gaza Conflict\nWhat is the likely duration of the IDF’s operation in Gaza?\nPredicting the duration is difficult, but based on previous engagements and the stated objectives of a “phased” approach, the initial phase could last several weeks, with the potential for a prolonged occupation depending on the success of the operation and the response from Hamas.\nHow will this conflict impact the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?\nUnfortunately, the current escalation is likely to further derail any prospects for meaningful peace negotiations. The increased violence and distrust will make it even more difficult to bridge the deep divisions between Israelis and Palestinians.\nWhat role will international diplomacy play in de-escalating the conflict?\nInternational diplomacy will be crucial, but its effectiveness is limited by the complex geopolitical dynamics and the lack of a unified approach among key stakeholders. The United States, Egypt, and Qatar are likely to play key roles in mediating a ceasefire, but success is far from guaranteed.\nThe unfolding events in Gaza represent more than just a localized conflict. They are a harbinger of a new era of regional instability, characterized by limited war doctrines, technological disruption, and a growing humanitarian crisis. Understanding these trends is critical for navigating the complex challenges that lie ahead and preventing further escalation.\nWhat are your predictions for the long-term consequences of this conflict?

      "text": "Amid ongoing Israeli attacks, ‘the systematic destruction of Gaza City is already underway’: UN rights office\nThe Israeli military has escalated attacks across Gaza City, reportedly deciding to press ahead with plans to take full control which will only lead to further “mass killings of civilians” and displacement, UN human rights officials warned on Wednesday.\nRecent attacks have been particularly devastating in the Az Zaytoun neighbourhood, where airstrikes, artillery shelling and gunfire are continuous and intense, causing a high number of civilian casualties and the large-scale destruction of residential buildings and public facilities, the UN human rights office, OHCHR, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory said in a statement.\nSince 8 August, the office has recorded 54 attacks on residential buildings and entire blocks in Gaza City, killing 87 Palestinians, including at least 25 children and entire families.\nIt also recorded attacks on shelters for internally displaced people, including tents and schools, killing at least 14.\nThese casualty figures “indicate that the systematic destruction of Gaza City is already underway,” the statement said.\nHowever, OHCHR stressed that these devastating figures are only a portion of the actual toll due to underreporting in such dire circumstances.\nImpact of attacks\nAs a result of recent attacks, hundreds of families have been forced to flee, with nowhere safe to go amid dire humanitarian conditions across the Gaza Strip.\nHowever, those who remain trapped are completely cut off from food, water and medical supplies.\nOHCHR emphasised that “Israel’s reported decision to take full control of Gaza City and to forcibly displace its population will lead to mass killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure vital to the survival of the population.”\nThe office is seeing the Israeli military repeat means of warfare that caused mass killings, serious injuries, forced displacement, arbitrary detention, starvation and extensive destruction in previous operations in North Gaza and Rafah.\nTo reportedly prepare for the offensive, the Israeli military has repeatedly called on Palestinians to move to Al Mawasi, west of Khan Younis.\nHowever, Israel has repeatedly struck tents of the displaced in Al Mawasi, where people are struggling to survive with barely any access to food, water and other necessities.\nViolations of international law\nUnder international law, Israel must not destroy civilian property unless it is rendered necessary by military operations. Yet, the widespread destruction of residential buildings in Gaza City is not seen as an imperative military necessity.\nAdditionally, by forcing the entire population of Gaza City and those remaining in North Gaza into displacement – with no shelter, food or medical provisions and no indication for allowing them to return to their homes in the future – OHCHR is concerned that these are grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\nThus, the office is urging States party to the Geneva Conventions to follow their obligation “to exert maximum pressure on Israel to immediately halt this offensive, which risks triggering an unprecedented, life-threatening humanitarian crisis and permanently extinguishing the Palestinian presence in Gaza’s largest urban area.”\nWorst-case famine\nMeanwhile, the World Food Programme (WFP) welcomed Japan’s life-saving contribution of 500 million yen ($3.3 million) to provide emergency food and nutrition assistance to Palestinians as they face severe food insecurity.\nAdding to the assistance, on 4 August, limited commercial truck entries resumed, containing mainly dry food items and a small amount of fresh produce, according to the UN aid coordination office, OCHA.\nHowever, the risk of spoilage and infestation of food supplies has drastically increased due to being stranded for months, heat and impending expiration dates.\nFurthermore, cooking gas has not entered Gaza for over five months, and firewood has become increasingly unaffordable, forcing many to use waste and scrap wood as alternative cooking sources, exacerbating health and environmental risks.\nDue to such limited aid, WFP underscored that the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report finds that the worst-case scenario of famine is currently occurring in the Gaza Strip.\n“I meet families who have lost everything and don’t know where their next meal will come from.” said Antoine Renard, WFP Representative and Country Director in Palestine.\nBut thanks to this support from Japan, he continued, “WFP can continue procuring life-saving food assistance, but we urgently need a ceasefire and sustained access to reach those most at risk and prevent a full-scale famine.”"

Israel currently holds about 75pc of the Gaza Strip.\nMany of Israel’s closest allies have urged the government to reconsider but Netanyahu is under pressure from some far-right members of his coalition to reject a temporary ceasefire, continue the war and pursue the annexation of the territory.\nOne far-right member, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, announced final approval on Wednesday of a widely condemned Israeli plan for a settlement project in the occupied West Bank that he said would erase any prospect of a Palestinian state.\nThe war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when gunmen led by Hamas attacked southern Israeli communities near the border, killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages including children into Gaza.\nOver 62,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air and ground war in Gaza since then, according to Gaza health officials, who do not say how many were militants but have said most of those killed have been women and children.\nHamas has accepted a proposal put forward by Arab mediators for a 60-day ceasefire that would involve releasing some of the remaining hostages and freeing Palestinian prisoners in Israel.\nThe Israeli government, which has said all the 50 remaining hostages must be released at once, is studying the proposal. Israeli authorities believe that 20 hostages are still alive.\nMany Gazans and foreign leaders fear a storming of Gaza City would cause significant casualties. Israel says it will help civilians leave battle zones before any assault begins.\nIsraeli troops clashed on Wednesday with more than 15 Hamas militants who emerged from tunnel shafts and attacked with gunfire and anti-tank missiles near Khan Younis, south of Gaza City, severely wounding one soldier and lightly wounding two others, an Israeli military official said.\nIn a statement, Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades confirmed carrying out a raid on Israeli troops southeast of Khan Younis and engaging Israeli troops at point-blank range. It said one fighter blew himself up among the soldiers, causing casualties, during an attack that lasted several hours.\nIsrael's military campaign has caused widespread devastation across the Gaza Strip, which before the war was home to about 2.3 million Palestinians. Many buildings including homes, schools and mosques have been destroyed, while the military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure.\nMost Gazans have been displaced multiple times and forced into densely packed areas along the Mediterranean coast, including in Gaza City in the enclave's north.\nIsraeli officials have said evacuation orders would be issued to Gaza City residents before any force moves in.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which oversees Gaza's only Catholic Church, located in Gaza City, said it had received reports that neighbourhoods near the small parish had started to receive evacuation notices.\nHamas, an Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza for almost two decades, has been severely weakened by the war. The Israeli military says Hamas has been reduced to a guerrilla force.\nThe Israeli military official who briefed reporters on Wednesday said Hamas had been trying to regroup and re-form in Gaza City in a more organised manner, but gave no evidence to support the assertion.\nHamas has said it would release all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to war. Israel says it will not end the war before Hamas disarms.\nOpinion polls show strong Israeli public support for ending the war if it ensures the release of the hostages, and a rally in Tel Aviv urging the government to pursue such a deal drew a huge crowd on Saturday.\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll of Americans showed a 58pc majority believe that every country in the United Nations should recognise Palestine as a nation."

      "text": "JERUSALEM: Defense Minister Israel Katz has given the green light to call up sixty thousand reservists in the coming weeks to seize Gaza City.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that on 8th August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, bewildered by the condemnations of security cabinet’s decision apropos controlling Gaza City, took a U-Turn saying that he did not intend to occupy Gaza: “We are not going to occupy Gaza – we are going to free Gaza from Hamas.”\nEyal Zamir, the chief of Israeli armed forces, himself opposed the plan to occupy Gaza City. Moreover, the Israeli reservist organization had asked the troops to ignore orders. Yotam Vilk, a captain in the reserves said in a Haaretz‘ op-ed that he felt betrayed by the Israeli government: “I can’t stay silent. Not after I saw with my own eyes the human toll of any additional day in Gaza. Not after I saw what neglect and abandonment look like, and how a government willing to sacrifice all of us for the sake of its false promises looks like.”\nFrance, that is set to recognise the state of Palestine at the UN session, has condemned in strongest terms the Israeli’s plan to control Gaza city: “These actions would constitute further serious violations of international law and lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable, sovereign, and contiguous state, and pose a threat to regional stability.” France believes that the future of Gaza should be through a framework of a future Palestinian state led by Palestinian Authority.\nOn 8th of August, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen called on Israel to reconsider its plan to control Gaza. Taking to the Social Media, she stated, state: “The Israeli government’s decision to further extend its military operation in Gaza must be reconsidered. At the same time, there must be the release of all hostages, who are being held in inhumane conditions. And humanitarian aid must be given immediate and unhindered access to Gaza to deliver what is urgently needed on the ground. A ceasefire is needed now.”\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz proclaimed that his country would not approve any exports of military equipment to Israel. Germany, that had supported Jerusalem for a long time, warned in May: “The Israeli government must not do anything that its best friends are no longer prepared to accept.” But now Merz has made it clear that Berlin would not tolerate the worsening condition in Gaza. Belgium disapproved Israel’s plan to control Gaza City and continued colonisation of Palestinian land. Maxime Prevot, Belgium’s Foreign Minister, told that the Israeli Envoy had been informed about Brussels’ stance.\nNewspakistan.tv"

      "text": "TEL AVIV — Israelon Wednesday entered the first stages of a planned assault on Gaza City after approving a plan to take it over that includes calling up 60,000 reservists for an expanded military operation in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n“We have begun the preliminary actions and the initial stages of the offensive on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding positions on the outskirts of Gaza City,” Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters on Wednesday.\nHe added: “We will intensify the strikes on Hamas in Gaza City, the political and military stronghold of the terror organization.”\nDefrin also said that to “minimize harm to civilians,” the IDF will be warning citizens to allow them to evacuate.\n“We are continuing to allow humanitarian aid for the residents of the Strip and are even expanding it — with additional central aid distribution points,” he said.\nThe U.S. ally appeared to be pushing ahead Wednesday with a new phase of its war despite international opposition — and in the face of a renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has authorized the plans for the major new operation, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed to NBC News. It will also see an additional 20,000 reservists have their service extended, the Israeli military said.\nThe assault is expected to force thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza to the south of the strip, which is suffering an intensifying hunger crisis under Israel’s military offensive and aid restrictions.\nIn a statement Wednesday night, the prime minister’s office said that “ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables — for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas — be shortened.”\n“The Prime Minister expresses his great appreciation for the reservist fighters who have been mobilized and their families, and all IDF soldiers,” the statement added. “Together we will win.”\nHamas did not issue an immediate response to the announcement about Israeli troops taking up positions outside Gaza City.\nU.S. President Donald Trump supports Israel’s efforts to disarm Hamas, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n“Israel has to make this decision and has to live with whatever decision they make. But President Trump is fully supportive of making sure that Hamas knows that from the U.S. perspective, they have to disarm, they have to give up and let all the hostages go,” he said. “Whether it takes 60 days or 60 minutes, that’s the ultimate end result.”\nScores of people in Gaza have starved to death in recent weeks, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave.\nIn addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated Israel’s streets, with growing numbers demanding an end to the offensive in the enclave.\nHundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.\nIsrael also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.\nHuckabee said that recent announcements by European leaders recognizing a Palestinian state would be “counterproductive.”\n“If they believe that, unilaterally, calling for a two-state a Palestinian state recognition immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it’s taking them further away,” he said.\nCeasefire talks uncertain\nKatz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was holding a discussion Tuesday to approve “strike plans in Gaza” with the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.\nThe announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off news that Hamas had agreed to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free the remaining hostages.\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.\n“The ball is now in Israel’s court,” Abdelatty said, adding: “We would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians.”\nAsked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be “under immense pressure.”\nAsked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said “no” and did not provide further clarification.\n‘There is no safe place’\nNew satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel’s advance, with the country’s plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave’s south condemned by rights groups.\nImagery captured on Aug. 16 shows that sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on Aug. 9.\nMohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again — just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel’s offensive.\n“Thank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,” Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel’s assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.\nThe family was able to live in their home for the past six months — but with Israel planning to take over Gaza City, they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza.\n“There is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,” Abu Sharia said. “My concern is to save the family’s life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.”\n“Further displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.\n“With more than 80 percent of Gaza already impacted by evacuation orders, it is unimaginable that civilians could be compelled to move to an even smaller area,” it said.\nIsrael launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.\nSince then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, with much of the territory destroyed.\nRecent Comments"

      "text": "Israel prepares major offensive on Gaza City, mobilizing tens of thousands of troops\nThe Israeli military is preparing a major offensive against Hamas in Gaza City, involving five divisions and tens of thousands of troops, the Israel Defence Forces said.\nThe forces include 12 brigade-level teams, each with infantry, armoured units, artillery, combat engineers, and support elements. In addition, the Gaza Division’s northern and southern brigades, normally assigned to the border, will join, bringing the total number of brigade-level teams to 14.\nThe operation, called “Gideon’s Chariots B,” is already entering its preparatory phase, with IDF units advancing on Gaza City’s outskirts. The Nahal Infantry Brigade and the 7th Armoured Brigade have been active in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, while the Givati Infantry Brigade launched a push in Kafr Jabalia in the city’s north.\nAt the same time, the military is establishing humanitarian infrastructure in southern Gaza for an estimated one million civilians expected to be displaced. Field hospitals and additional aid distribution points are planned, and the European Hospital in Khan Yunis, closed after the IDF discovered a Hamas tunnel beneath it, is expected to reopen.\n“As part of the preparations to move the population from Gaza City to the southern Gaza Strip, talks have begun with international organizations to recruit them to establish additional field hospitals in the south, and there is a positive response to this,” a security official said. “There are also plans to expand the existing medical infrastructure in the south in cooperation with the organizations, and, in addition, options are being examined to open access routes to additional medical facilities.”\n“The UN and the organizations have begun formulating a plan to restart the European Hospital as an additional medical response,” the official added.\nThe offensive will unfold in stages. First, civilians will receive evacuation warnings. Then the IDF will encircle Gaza City before advancing into areas previously uncleared of Hamas infrastructure. Defence Minister Israel Katz approved the plan on Tuesday, and it is scheduled for presentation to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Cabinet on Thursday.\nTo support the campaign, Israel is mobilising 60,000 reservists in several waves, with the first 40,000–50,000 expected to report on September 2. A second wave is planned for late 2025, and a third for early 2026. Regular soldiers’ service will be extended by 30 to 40 days to meet operational needs. At the peak of the operation, the military anticipates up to 130,000 reserve soldiers on active duty across Gaza, Judea and Samaria, and northern Israel.\nThe IDF reiterated that the offensive’s political objective is to defeat Hamas. “Two out of five brigades of Hamas’ military wing remain,” an IDF source said. “The Chief of Staff believes in the need to defeat Hamas,” though the military did not define the criteria for this goal.\nCivilian preparations are already underway through the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), which is coordinating hospital readiness and field hospital construction in southern Gaza. International organisations will help operate facilities in areas including the Central and Mawasi refugee camps, where displaced Gaza City residents are expected to relocate.\n“This is an evolving plan,” the army said, “and preparations on the outskirts of Gaza City are ongoing as part of a larger effort to expand operations deeper into the city while minimizing civilian casualties.”\nApproximately 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas’s attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 50 remaining hostages, around 30 are believed to be dead."
