The CBO, Congress‚Äôs impartial fiscal analyst, shared these updated projections on Friday.\nIf President Trump‚Äôs tariff policies persist for the next 10 years, the CBO estimates a $3.3 trillion reduction in primary deficits.

The current top tariff rates may not hold as negotiations with trading partners and international legal challenges are ongoing.\n‚ÄúWe estimate that the effective tariff rate for goods imported into the United States has increased by about 18 percentage points when measured against 2024 trade flows,‚Äù the budget office said in its report, adding that Trump‚Äôs tariffs would reduce ‚Äúthe need for federal borrowing.‚Äù\nThe CBO also said it ‚Äúprojects further increases in tariff revenues in the coming months‚Äù and that ‚Äúif there are no further changes in tariff rates, we project that customs duties from new and existing tariffs will total about $200 billion this fiscal year.‚Äù\nBut the office cautioned that revenues often lag several months behind the implementation of tariff policies, noting that once the rates are in effect, they don‚Äôt get applied to goods that are already in transit to the United States.\n‚ÄúIn addition, importers have the option to delay payments by up to six weeks by participating in Customs and Border Protection‚Äôs Periodic Monthly Statement program,‚Äù added the CBO, which is a federal agency within the legislative branch that provides budget and economic information to both houses of Congress.\nIn July, Congress passed the GOP-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that contained several major Trump priorities on energy, the border, spending and tax cuts. The CBO has said that it would add around $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the coming decade, although the White House has disputed those figures.\nThe Trump administration has also said that the tariffs and policies initiated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump backed and signed into law, would bring forth economic growth over the coming years that would offset any additions to the national deficit.\n‚ÄúIt was the largest tax cut for middle- and working-class families in our nation‚Äôs history, and the president wants to see this country get our fiscal house in order. That‚Äôs why this was a fiscally responsible bill,‚Äù White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 21 in response to the CBO report on the bill.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the White House again touted the bill by posting excerpts from a series of recent newspaper articles that praised the measure. Earlier this month, the administration also said that Americans would see an average tax cut of $3,752 under the bill, citing a report from nonprofit organization the Tax Foundation.\nFriday‚Äôs report from the CBO comes as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada would scrap some of its retaliatory tariffs against the United States. Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico earlier this year, saying those measures were necessary to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the country.\n‚ÄúWe have the best deal of anyone in the world right now,‚Äù Carney told reporters in Ottawa. ‚ÄúToday, the government of Canada is harmonizing its tariffs with the U.S.‚Äù\nReuters contributed to this report."

      "text": "Politics\nCBO Vindicates Trump, Admits Tariffs Will Reduce Deficit By Trillions\nA new report released by the Congressional Budget Office, which regularly releases information to Congress concerning the impact of tariffs, has finally admitted that President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs are going to reduce the deficit.\nThe report revealed that as of Aug. 19, the current tariff rate on goods brought into the U.S. has risen about 18 percentage points when measured against figures from 2024. CBO officials say this increase will help draw down primary deficits by a whopping $3.3 trillion if the higher tariff rate continues for the period of 2025-2035.\nOne of the reasons for the drop, according to the CBO, is that the tariffs reduce the need for federal borrowing. The money collected from the tariffs will reduce federal outlays for interest by another $0.7 trillion. The total reduction in deficits will reach $4 trillion.\nThe numbers are higher than those proposed back in June. The data used to come up with these estimates is gleaned from the Census Bureau, Customs and Border Protection, and the Treasury Department.\n‚ÄúThe methods account for a diversion of trade from countries facing high tariff rates to other countries facing lower tariff rates. The estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, largely owing to questions about timing, possible exceptions, and a lack of precedents,‚Äù the CBO wrote.\nWhile this is good news, not everything the CBO stated in its latest report was positive. In fact, according to The Hill, the report claims that the president‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big, Beautiful Bill‚Äù is fueling economic inequality, a claim that Vice President JD Vance ripped to shreds.\n‚ÄúFirst of all, the Congressional Budget Office, sometimes they put out reports that are absolutely atrocious, and I think this is a good example of a very atrocious report,‚Äù he remarked during an address, leading to loud applause from the audience.\n‚ÄúThe CBO report, which was done at the request of Democrats, found that the top 10 percent of earners in the country will see an average boost of $13,600 per year over the next decade as a direct result of provisions in the law, while the bottom 10 percent will see an average annual decrease of $1,200,‚Äù The Hill said.\n‚ÄúThe most important thing for people who are living at the bottom of the income ladder is that they not pay taxes on their income sources,‚Äù the vice president added.\nHe then said, ‚ÄúSo, if you‚Äôre working hard and you‚Äôre working overtime, you‚Äôre going to get a big fat tax cut. If you‚Äôre working at a restaurant or some other business where you‚Äôre earning your wages primarily through tips, you‚Äôre going to get a big fat tax cut. And most importantly, the president‚Äôs economic policies are going to prevent your job from being shipped off to Asia or to Mexico. That is the very best thing for people at the bottom of the income ladder.‚Äù"

The current top tariff rates may not hold as negotiations with trading partners and international legal challenges are ongoing.\n‚ÄúWe estimate that the effective tariff rate for goods imported into the United States has increased by about 18 percentage points when measured against 2024 trade flows,‚Äù the budget office said in its report, adding that Trump‚Äôs tariffs would reduce ‚Äúthe need for federal borrowing.‚Äù\nThe CBO also said it ‚Äúprojects further increases in tariff revenues in the coming months‚Äù and that ‚Äúif there are no further changes in tariff rates, we project that customs duties from new and existing tariffs will total about $200 billion this fiscal year.‚Äù\nBut the office cautioned that revenues often lag several months behind the implementation of tariff policies, noting that once the rates are in effect, they don‚Äôt get applied to goods that are already in transit to the United States.\n‚ÄúIn addition, importers have the option to delay payments by up to six weeks by participating in Customs and Border Protection‚Äôs Periodic Monthly Statement program,‚Äù added the CBO, which is a federal agency within the legislative branch that provides budget and economic information to both houses of Congress.\nIn July, Congress passed the GOP-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that contained several major Trump priorities on energy, the border, spending, and tax cuts. The CBO has said that it would add around $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the coming decade, although the White House has disputed those figures.\nThe Trump administration has also said that the tariffs and policies initiated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump backed and signed into law, would bring forth economic growth over the coming years that would offset any additions to the national deficit.\n‚ÄúIt was the largest tax cut for middle and working class families in our nation‚Äôs history, and the president wants to see this country get our fiscal house in order. That‚Äôs why this was a fiscally responsible bill,‚Äù White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 21 in response to the CBO report on the bill.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the White House again touted the bill by posting excerpts from a series of recent newspaper articles that praised the measure. Earlier this month, the administration also said that Americans would see an average tax cut of $3,752 under the bill, citing a report from nonprofit organization the Tax Foundation.\nFriday‚Äôs report from the CBO comes as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada would scrap some of its retaliatory tariffs against the United States. Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico earlier this year, saying those measures were necessary to curb illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the country.\n‚ÄúWe have the best deal of anyone in the world right now,‚Äù Carney told reporters in Ottawa. ‚ÄúToday, the Government of Canada is harmonizing its tariffs with the U.S.‚Äù\nTyler Durden\nFri, 08/22/2025 ‚Äì 18:25\nRead further at ZeroHedge"

CBO estimated this would widen the deficit by US$3.4 trillion over the next decade.\nThe US federal debt is US$37.18 trillion, according to the treasury department. It has continued to grow under Republican and Democratic administrations as the US Congress continues to authorise the federal government to spend more money than it takes in.\nLawmakers face a government funding deadline at the end of September or risk a shutdown if spending bills are not passed.\nThe latest CBO estimate marks an increase from June when it forecast a US$2.5 trillion reduction in primary deficits and a US$500 billion cut in interest outlays.\nUS tariff rates across countries and products averaged 16.7% in August, up from 15.1% in June, according to Oxford Economics.\nMore than US$26 billion in duties have been assessed by US Customs and Border Protection this fiscal year, far surpassing the hundreds of millions recorded in the previous year, according to the analysis."

      "text": "President Donald Trump‚Äôs increased tariffs on U.S. imports could reduce the national deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nThe CBO estimates that tariff-related revenue could shrink primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and reduce federal interest payments by $0.7 trillion.\nThe big picture: These projections assume continuation of tariff hikes globally, though current top tariff rates may fluctuate due to ongoing negotiations and legal challenges.\n- The additional revenue from tariffs may help offset an estimated $3.4 trillion increase in the deficit caused by the Republicans‚Äô recently passed tax-cut and spending bill.\n- The U.S. federal debt currently stands at $37.18 trillion and has grown under both Republican and Democratic administrations amid continual government spending exceeding revenue.\nWhat we‚Äôre watching: A government funding deadline looms at the end of September, raising the risk of a shutdown if spending bills are not passed.\nDriving the news: The CBO‚Äôs latest forecast has increased compared to June, when deficit reductions were estimated at $2.5 trillion for primary deficits and $0.5 trillion for interest payments.\n- U.S. average tariff rates rose from 15.1% in June to 16.7% in August, with over $26 billion in duties collected this fiscal year, sharply up from the previous year‚Äôs hundreds of millions."
