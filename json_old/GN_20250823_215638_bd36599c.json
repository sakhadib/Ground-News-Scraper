The U.N.-backed group of experts said that half a million people in Gaza, a quarter of the population, are facing “catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death.” Nick Schifrin spoke with David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: For the first time since the war in Gaza began, the international organization that monitors and categorizes hunger crises around the world has declared that parts of Gaza are in famine. Amna Nawaz: The U.N.-backed group of international experts said today that half-a-million people in Gaza, one-quarter of the population, are facing — quote — \"catastrophic conditions characterized by starvation, destitution and death.\" And they warned that famine would spread within weeks without a cease-fire and a massive infusion of humanitarian aid into Gaza.Nick Schifrin has more. Nick Schifrin: The experts group is called the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC. And it's concluded that, after 22 months of war, the half-a-million people living around Gaza City face famine.You see that in purple stripes there. Just below that, in bright red, one million people around Deir al Balah and Khan Yunis districts are one step below famine, meaning they face very high, acute malnutrition. But the experts also said, by next month, those areas would also be in famine too. North Gaza, you see at the top there, is in gray because the experts didn't have enough data, but warned conditions there were just as bad or worse.And Rafah along the Egypt border in the south is white because Rafah is — quote — \"depopulated.\" U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher: Tom Fletcher, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator: It is a famine, the Gaza famine. It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel. It is a famine within a few hundred meters of food. Nick Schifrin: To discuss this more, we turn to David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, which oversees humanitarian relief operations in more than 40 countries, as well as in Gaza. He's also the former foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.David Miliband, thanks very much. Welcome back to the \"News Hour.\"The U.N. has been warning about famine conditions for a while now. How significant is it that the experts of the IPC have now officially declared famine? And what's unique about the IPC that gives it credibility? David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee: Well, today is a horrible milestone marking a true moral and political scandal, because the IPC are a technical, technocratic, small-C conservative body that are very careful in determining the question of famine.They have only declared three other famines in the whole of the 21st century, and they have to pass three very tough tests just to pick up the third test. Two deaths per 10,000 people per day in Gaza means that 400 people a day are dying of starvation in Gaza.And they do this work on the ground with reputable sources, with their own people, making sure that they are not taken away by rhetoric, but focus on the facts on the ground. The fact that they should have declared this famine, this is what they call a manmade disaster of the famine in Gaza, carries extra significance because of the credibility and seriousness of which they do their work. Nick Schifrin: So zoom out for us. The conditions in Gaza have been horrific for a while. Why are they getting worse, especially around Gaza City, where the IPC declared today's famine? David Miliband: Well, I think there are simple reasons for explaining the dramatic deterioration.There is the tourniquet that has been applied to aid flows. The blockage on aid flows that was announced by Prime Minister Netanyahu in the middle of March has had its effect. And in the previous reports of the IPC, they pointed to some of the dangers. Of course, the war is ongoing, so that adds to the problem.So, even for those families that have some beans, they can't cook them because they don't have cooking oil. So the displacement that is associated with the ongoing fighting has contributed to that. The destruction of agricultural land is part of the story too. And, of course, the great fear is that actually things are far worse than they seem in the report, because all of the evidence from the past is that the IPC reports are a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator.In the famine of 2011 in Somalia, 250,000 people were dead by the time that they declared famine. And so the great fear is that the statistics are actually worse, the reality on the ground is worse than the statistics suggest. Nick Schifrin: And, as I pointed out, the IPC said it didn't even have data enough for North Gaza to determine the levels of hunger there.You mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He released a statement today that called the report — quote — \"an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation. Israel has a policy of preventing starvation. Since the beginning of the war, Israel has enabled two million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip.\"And his statement goes on to accuse the IPC of ignoring Hamas' theft of humanitarian aid. What's your response to his statement? David Miliband: We take very seriously the need to make sure that aid reaches those who require it. And all of the evidence is that, when the system of nongovernmental organizations and the U.N. are allowed to do their work, they can reverse these trends.In the period of the cease-fire in January, February and early March of this year, we saw that the way in which the aid was being delivered to the people who needed it, and it had an impact on the humanitarian conditions on the ground. Since the return to fighting in the middle of March and the application of the blockade on aid flows, we have seen the reversal.Month by month, things have got worse. Even our own staff — we have the teams on the ground recruited locally. Even our own teams are suffering from lack of food and supplies. We as an organization have over five tons of nutritional support and medical supplies stuck on the wrong side of the border.And so the policy of the Israeli government is very clear. It's to restrict aid. And that has its consequence that you're seeing today. Nick Schifrin: And, just to be clear, those five tons that you say are stuck — quote — \"on the wrong side of the border,\" you believe Israel is blocking that aid from entering Gaza? David Miliband: Well, they're stuck in the line. There's no question about it at all. We know that there are enormous quantities of aid waiting to be allowed across, but they're not being allowed across.The only aid that's coming across is going to the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. What you need to know about them is that, instead of having 400 distribution points, which is what the U.N. and NGO system had in the March 8 — March-February period, there are four distribution points.And as you have reported on your show, around 1,200 people have been killed in the vicinity of those distribution points because of the crush, because of the shooting that's been happening there. So we have a well-proven system for mitigating the worst of war, but we're not allowing it to work in these circumstances. Nick Schifrin: And, finally, David Miliband, in the short time we have left, today's report also says that only a full-scale and sustained humanitarian aid program can prevent further loss of life.What is necessary right now to prevent more famine? David Miliband: Well, we need a cease-fire to get the aid in, to get the hostages out. That's obviously the immediate imperative.But opening the taps, which is what the report calls for, is absolutely vital. As soon as the aid is allowed in sufficient quantity, we will be able to get on with our work. We have this well-proven system. And we're desperate for the Israeli authorities to allow us to show again how it can work well. Nick Schifrin: David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, thank you very much.

      "text": "The UN is notoriously focused on condemning Israel far beyond the number of times it condemns other nations in the world.\nFrom 2015 through 2023, the UN General Assembly has adopted 154 resolutions against Israel and 71 against other countries...\nIn 2024, the UNGA is expected to adopt 18 resolutions on Israel and only seven resolutions on the entire rest of the world, which include one resolution each on North Korea, Iran, Syria, Myanmar, Russia for its violations in Georgia, Russia for its occupation of Crimea, and the United States for its embargo on Cuba, as detailed in the charts below.\nToday, the UN released an analysis under its Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), concluding that parts of Gaza are now suffering from famine.\nThe IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate — and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.\nThe number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said — around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\n\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"...\n“A ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,” said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"\nIsrael has denied the UN claims.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"...\nEarlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a “fabricated report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign.”\nThere's also a thread on X posted this morning by the Office of the Prime Minister:\nThis is not analysis. It is a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice. History will judge those who peddle it. The IPC must end its double standards against the Jewish state.\n— Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) August 22, 2025\nThe declaration from the UN comes just as Israel is launching a new invasion of Gaza City designed to force Hamas to surrender.\nIsrael's troops have established a foothold on the outskirts of the city - which is home to more than a million Palestinians - after days of intense bombing and artillery fire.\nIt has prompted UN Secretary General António Guterres to renew calls for an immediate ceasefire \"to avoid the death and destruction\" an assault would \"inevitably cause\".\nIsrael wants to signal that it is pressing ahead with its plan to capture all of Gaza City despite international criticism.\nMy own take is that multiple things can be true at once. Is the UN using this to pressure Israel (rather than Hamas) to end the war? Yes, clearly. Does this new report dovetail with demands for a ceasefire the UN was already making? Yes. Is there actual starvation happening in parts of Gaza? Yes, probably so. President Trump made this point several weeks ago: There are starving kids in Gaza.\n\"I think everybody — unless they're pretty coldhearted or, worse than that, nuts — there's nothing you can say other than 'it's terrible' when you see the kids... that are starving,\" says @POTUS on Gaza.\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) July 30, 2025\n\"They got to get them food — and we're going to get them food.\" pic.twitter.com/fkzTVITNIw\nOf course Hamas could end the war today by announcing they would surrender their arms, give up control of Gaza and return the remaining 50 or so hostages. But as usual, Hamas is counting on Israel to be more humane toward their own people than they themselves are. The rest of the world seems to take this for granted, just like the tunnels built under homes and hospitals.\nJoin the conversation as a VIP Member"

      "text": "Israel Is Forcing Parents in Gaza to Watch Their Children Die of Hunger\n“Imagine looking at your child, and you can’t feed him. You can’t do anything for him.”\nGAZA CITY—Umm Jana’s two-and-a-half year-old daughter, Jouri, died earlier this month from malnutrition. Now, her other daughter, five-year-old Jana, is also slowly starving to death and there is little Umm Jana can do to save her.\n“My daughter Jouri—because of the famine—was deeply affected. She developed severe malnutrition and health complications that led to her death. I hope I never have to go through with Jana what I went through with Jouri,” Umm Jana told Drop Site News in an interview at the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City. Jana was lying on a cot beside her, barely stirring.\n“We're living through extremely difficult days and a very harsh famine,” she said. “Jana is battling death. Her condition is extremely severe. She needs to be transferred abroad because there is no adequate treatment for what she’s experiencing.”\nOn Friday, the world’s leading authority on food crisis—the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)—officially declared a full-blown, Phase 5 “catastrophic” famine in the governorate of Gaza, which includes Gaza City, a classification characterized by “starvation, destitution, and death.”\nAaed Abu Khater’s 13-year-old son, Atef, died from malnutrition earlier this month in Gaza City. “Atef was like the rest of the people, suffering from a lack of food and water,” Abu Khater told Drop Site. “Imagine looking at your child, and you can’t feed him. You can’t do anything for him…The most precious thing I had, my son, died of hunger.”\nWithout proper nutrients, including vegetables and protein, Atef’s weight dropped dramatically and his condition continued to deteriorate until he was no longer able to walk or move. Abu Khater carried him to hospital where he spent 18 days on IV fluids before being discharged due to a lack of beds. “When we were finally able to feed him, the hunger had exhausted him so much he could barely eat. He could barely chew potatoes and he couldn’t eat bread,” Abu Khater said.\nDuring the three days he was back at home, two of Atef’s cousins were shot and killed in an aid massacre at the Zikim crossing. “You’re going to die either way. If you go to Zikim, you’ll die. If you stay in your tent, you’ll die. You’ll die from hunger, or you’ll be shot. It’s a trap,” Abu Khater said.\nAtef was clearly dying at home, so his father prepared to take him back to the hospital. In the morning, as his mother washed him and got him ready to go, he died sitting in a chair. “If I showed you his picture when he was in middle school, Atef was tall, and I’d say his weight was around 60 kilograms. By the time we buried Atef, he was barely over 25 kilos. When we buried him, we did it in a small grave, about 50 centimeters wide, placed next to those of his uncles. He was a skeleton—just bones covered in skin,” Abu Khater said.\nAccording to the IPC, for a region to be technically classified as experiencing famine, at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished, and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nConditions in the North Gaza governorate, which includes Beit Hanoun and Jabalia, are estimated to be just as severe or even worse. Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis in the south, which are currently classified as Phase 4—experiencing “emergency” hunger—are expected to officially be declared in a famine by September.\n“As this famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the IPC said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay—even by days—will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality.”\n“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip,” the IPC emphasized, “and if essential food supplies, and basic health, nutrition, and WASH services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”\nUnited Nations officials said in no uncertain terms that the famine in Gaza is a result of Israeli policy, with the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Volker Turk calling it “the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government” and adding, “It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing.”\nTom Fletcher, the under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator said it was a “21st century famine, watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history…It is a famine on all of our watch. Everyone owns this, the Gaza famine is the world's famine.\"\nIsrael has imposed a harsh siege on Gaza for nearly two decades. Beginning in 2007, Israeli authorities mandated that Palestinians in the enclave should receive the minimum amount of food to avoid malnutrition, providing 37% fewer fruits and vegetables than the average Israeli has access to.\nWhen Israel launched its genocidal assault in October 2023, it imposed a full-spectrum blockade, which eased and tightened over the course of the past 22 months. In March, Israel imposed the longest full-spectrum blockade of the war, with no aid entering Gaza for nearly three months. It dismantled the UN aid distribution system that was in place and, on May 27, it began allowing in a little amount of aid in a system overseen by the U.S., Europe and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, with just four distribution sites located in heavily militarized zones. Since then, over 2,000 starving Palestinians have been killed as they try to get food in aid massacres.\nThe forced starvation campaign reached a tipping point this summer. At least 273 people in Gaza have died of famine and malnutrition since the start of war, including 112 children. A staggering 86 of those starvation deaths—or 68% of the total—have occurred in the past month, according to a tally of Health Ministry figures. Absent a ceasefire and a massive influx of aid and medical treatment, many more are projected to die of hunger and malnutrition in the coming period.\nIn June 2024, Israel bombed the tent camp where the Abu Khater family was taking shelter. Abu Khater was injured, one of his other sons was killed, and his youngest son was wounded with shrapnel in the eye. “One died from a bombing. Another died from hunger. Maybe another one will die from scabies, or disease, or the sewage, or from lack of hygiene. You go to sleep terrified, you don’t know where death is going to come from,” Abu Khater said. “There are hundreds, thousands going through the same thing. It’s repeating daily.”\nDr. Musab Farwana, a pediatrician in the Pediatric Department and Malnutrition Department at the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital, told Drop Site that all medical facilities in Gaza have a dire lack of supplies.\n“As a hospital, we lack baby formula, nutritional supplements, Cerelac, biscuits, and therapeutic food like peanut butter paste—all of which on its own is not enough. For children aged around one to one and a half years, we also need vegetables, meats, and proteins. Vegetables provide essential vitamins. This is something the entire population of Gaza, around 2.4 million people, is deprived of. We all lack these nutrients,” he said.\nInside the hospital, emaciated children and babies barely able to move lie in cots or sit with blank stares, drawn faces, and ribcages and spines poking out from their torsos.\nInside the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City. August 7, 2025. (Video by Abdel Qader Sabbah)\n“We’re seeing children not only with malnutrition but also with severe dehydration due to the lack of clean drinking water. The cases are very critical. We are at risk of losing many children. If things continue like this and are not addressed urgently, the situation will worsen. We will lose more and more innocent lives—dozens, even hundreds of children.”\nMadlalah Dawwas’s 9-year-old daughter, Maryam, is in danger of dying by starvation. A skeletal figure, she lay on a cot in the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital, barely able to move. Dawwas told Drop Site she first began losing weight three months into the war as food became increasingly scarce. The family had been forcibly displaced to the south and Dawwas took her to several hospitals to be treated for malnutrition. During the ceasefire in January, when the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza significantly increased, Maryam’s condition improved.\n“During the truce, Maryam improved by 80%. But when the truce ended and the war returned, the fear came back. Fruits and vegetables were cut off again, famine returned all over again—and I began to fear for Maryam again,” Dawwas said. “Maryam lost so many things she loved, and I couldn't provide them to her in this famine,” she said adding, “She would, open my phone sometimes and ask me to turn on the internet, because she loved watching food videos on YouTube—Western food videos, and the meals she liked.”\nAs she spoke, Dawwas reached over and used a syringe to insert a few drops of milk into her daughter’s mouth.\nMadlalah Dawwas with her 9-year-old daughter, Maryam, in the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City. August 7, 2025. (Video by Abdel Qader Sabbah)\n“When Maryam is sleeping, I stare at her. I just want to wake her—not to feed her or give her milk or change her diaper—just to make sure she’s still breathing. I always imagine she’s gone, but then I distract myself, try to focus on something else, and say: ‘No, thank God. God will not take her from me.’ I just want Maryam to go back to how she used to be.”\nThe IPC report warns that the man-made famine is only projected to spread. “Increasing reports of malnutrition-related deaths indicate that the most vulnerable in society are beginning to succumb. This trend is expected to increase amongst vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases, before spreading to the wider population.”\n“The overall situation is no secret to anyone, including the entire world: Gaza is going through an extremely severe and man-made famine caused by the complete Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip,” Dr. Farwana said. “We are a people who deserve life. A people who have been oppressed, wounded and abandoned by everyone, whether the Western world or the Islamic world. We are not being treated with basic human decency. We have been wronged by everyone.”\nDrop Site News Middle East Research Fellow Jawa Ahmad contributed to this report.\nThe policy of starvation is totally undefencable. Israelies have been treated with more than enough of mankind's in-humanity to fully understand what they are doing. IT MUST STOP.\nThe USA-Israeli Axis is operated by thousands of Miller-Eichmanns with salivations from millions of White Volks. Genocide has long been a banality under soul-crunching capitalism. Where is love? Fled the solar system in horror."

Any further delay – even by days – will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.\n“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”\nThe IPC warned in July that a “famine scenario” was unfolding in parts of Gaza but until now it had stopped short of making a formal declaration, citing a lack of hard data.\nIn addition to a famine in and around Gaza City, the biggest built-up area of the territory and home to between 500,000 and 800,000 people, the report declares that the towns of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in the centre and south of Gaza are likely to experience famine “in coming weeks”.\nThe experts say the data is insufficient to declare a famine in the north of the territory, though aid officials say the conditions there are thought to be the most severe and have called for urgent steps to allow for a full humanitarian assessment.\nIbtisam Saleh, 50, who lives in Gaza City, said she and her 29-year-old son had been eating one meal a day for weeks, and many times they had nothing at all. “I cook only lentils, nothing else is available to us,” she told the Guardian. “Yesterday a donor gave us a small bag of rice. As for food kitchens, I cannot eat their food, it makes my stomach hurt if I taste it. And I do not have the strength to stand in line waiting to get my share.”\nIn order to declare a famine, strict criteria must be met: at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition; and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to “outright starvation”.\nThe declaration of famine in Gaza will increase pressure on Israel to ease the tight restrictions it has maintained on supplies since the beginning of the 22-month-old conflict.\nDavid Lammy, Britain’s foreign secretary, condemned the famine as a “moral outrage”. “The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable,” he said in a statement. “The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe.”\nAmjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs Network, who is based in Gaza City, said: “This is the worst, the most critical stage in the entire history of Gaza, not just in this war. We are in a very complicated situation. We feel very sick and very tired. We must get food otherwise we cannot imagine what will happen.”\nIsrael rejected the findings the report, claiming there was no famine in Gaza and that the findings were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israeli forces will launch a massive new assault on Gaza City within weeks. Aid officials said any further offensives in Gaza would have catastrophic consequences for the population.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israel-backed organisation that was supposed to replace aid groups that previously distributed food to much of the population in Gaza, is failing to distribute sufficient food.\nThe UN and other organisations face massive logistical obstacles including widespread looting due to an almost total breakdown of the rule of law, ongoing Israeli combat operations, Israel’s administrative restrictions and bureaucracy and damaged infrastructure within Gaza.\nRiham Kraiem, 35, who is living in a tent in Gaza City, said her eldest son, 13, had travelled to the aid distribution areas in the north of Gaza, risking his life in largely fruitless efforts to bring food for the family of 10. “My children’s health … is now very poor,” she said. “There’s nothing nutritious for them to eat. I can’t provide proper food to support their bodies. My four-year-old daughter’s condition is deteriorating, she is suffering from malnutrition and is sick because of it.\n“I have no food supplies left. We left some behind in our home when we fled and the house was destroyed. Yesterday my son went again to look for aid and got one kilogram of pasta and a can of tomato sauce. He didn’t get it from the aid distribution, a young man there gave it to him. He came back feeling like he was flying from happiness.”\nThe IPC report expresses grave concern at the continued and large-scale killing of civilians while trying to access food deliveries and the inadequate planning, implementation and monitoring of the privatised food distributions conducted by the GHF.\nIt calls for “urgent, comprehensive and sustained action to end the swiftly deteriorating and ever-expanding humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip”.\nAccording to figures from Gaza’s health ministry, verified by the World Health Organization, deaths from malnutrition and starvation in Gaza have risen sharply. In the 22 months after the 7 October attacks by Hamas, 89 deaths were attributed to malnutrition or starvation, mostly children under 18. In the first 20 days of August there were 133 deaths, including 25 under-18s, the ministry said on Wednesday.\nIsrael disputes the hunger fatality figures given by the health ministry of Gaza’s Hamas-run government, arguing that the deaths were due to other medical causes.\nIsraeli officials said more than 220 aid trucks entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings on Thursday.\n© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The report comes as Israel has faced intense scrutiny over its starvation of Gaza’s civilian population.\n“Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response,” the report said. “This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.”\nFamine declared by IPC in #Gaza Governorate is a direct result of actions by #Israel‘s Government that has unlawfully restricted entry & distribution of humanitarian aid.\nIt is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to a… pic.twitter.com/knqnRpe2yH\n— UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) August 22, 2025\nThe IPC report highlights that between May and July the proportion of households experiencing extreme hunger has doubled, with one in three people going without any food for days at a time.\nChildren have particularly suffered, with 20,000 children being admitted for treatment of acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, more than 3,000 children have been severely malnourished, and hospitals have reported at least 16 children dying from hunger since mid-July.\nREAD: Green Beret Lt Colonel tells Tucker: Gaza ‘post-Apocalyptic,’ US ‘complicit’ with war crimes\nThe report also noted that a major factor in the ongoing famine of Gaza is repeated denials of requests for humanitarian access. The IPC stressed that while the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claimed to have distributed over 89 million meals from four distribution sites, most of the food items still need to be cooked with water and fuel, which are largely unavailable.\nIn response to the concerning IPC report, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF issued a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access to the region.\n“A ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the joint statement. “\nGhebreyesys continued:\nThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine. Widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases… are becoming fatal, especially for children. The health system, run by hungry and exhausted health workers, cannot cope. Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines to save lives and begin the process of reversing malnutrition. Hospitals must be protected so that they can continue treating patients. Aid blockages must end, and peace must be restored, so that healing can begin.\nREAD: ‘Pro-life’ GOP starving 1 million children to death in Gaza, USCCB remains silent\nSince the October 7, 2023, attack, as reported extensively by LifeSiteNews, Israeli forces have deliberately sought to bring about the destruction of the people of Gaza, including 1 million children, by various means, including the deprivation of food, water, energy, and medical care, amounting to crimes of genocide."

A 21st-century famine watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history. It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war. It is a famine on all of our watch … a famine that will and must haunt us all.”\nSome 280,000 of the affected Palestinians are in a northern region covering Gaza City – known as Gaza governorate – which the IPC said was now in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nIt is the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but that limited data prevented any precise classification. Reuters has previously reported on the IPC's struggle to get access to data required to assess the crisis.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine, at least 20 per cent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nPreviously, the IPC has only registered famines in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. Cogat, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’s propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nIsrael has long counted on the United States, its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65 per cent of Americans believe the US should help those starving in Gaza. Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Mr Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there is no starvation.\nThe IPC said its analysis only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data, and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region, as it is largely uninhabited.\nThe Gaza war was triggered on 7 October 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. The Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that at least 62,192 Palestinians have been killed in the war.\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "The world’s leading food insecurity authority has officially declared famine in Gaza, after officials finally determined that Israel’s almost two year long, near-total blockade on the 2 million Palestinians in the Strip has created conditions so horrific they surpass those needed for a famine declaration.\nThe UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed that famine is occurring in Gaza in a report on Friday.\n“As of 15 August 2025, Famine (IPC Phase 5) — with reasonable evidence – is confirmed in Gaza Governorate,” the group said, referring to the region of Gaza encompassing Gaza City and surrounding areas. The experts said famine conditions are expected to spread to the areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of September, barring a complete cessation of Israel and the U.S.’s starvation campaign.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nThe group said that over half a million Palestinians are facing Phase 5 food insecurity, which is the group’s most dire classification, of “catastrophe” or “famine.” About 1.1 million Palestinians, roughly half the population, are experiencing Phase 4 “emergency” levels of hunger, while the remaining population of roughly 200,000 are experiencing a food “crisis,” of Phase 3.\nIsrael’s famine “is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment — and a failure of humanity itself,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. “Famine is not about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival.”\nExperts have long pointed out that conditions must be extremely dire for the IPC to classify a famine, as the group can only do so in response to escalated mortality and starvation rates. For months, Palestinians have pleaded for the entry of food, and humanitarian groups have warned of famine. But instead of allowing more aid, Israel and the U.S. came up with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) scheme that made getting food a death trap.\nAn official famine declaration is distinct from a Phase 5 classification. In order for the IPC to declare a famine, three criteria must be met. A fifth of the households in the area must be facing an “extreme lack of food”; 30 percent of children must be suffering from acute malnutrition; and the mortality rate for non-trauma deaths must be two adults per 10,000, or four children per 10,000 daily. The child malnutrition condition may also be met when 15 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition as measured by the circumference of their arms.\nThe IPC has only declared a famine five times since it was established in 2004; once in Somalia, twice in South Sudan, and once in Sudan last year. The declaration in Gaza marks the first time it has ever been declared outside of the continent of Africa.\nIPC noted that many of the elements of the famine in Gaza are unprecedented.\n“Never before has the [Famine Review Committee] had to return so many times to the same crisis; a stark reflection of how suffering has not only persisted but intensified and spread until famine has begun to emerge,” the group wrote in its report.\n“As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed,” it went on.\nIsrael has escalated its starvation campaign in recent months, implementing a total aid blockade for nearly three months starting in March, then pivoting to the GHF scheme where Israel rounds up Palestinians into distribution sites just to massacre them on a near-daily basis.\nGaza health officials have recorded nearly 300 deaths, including over 100 children, to starvation amid the genocide, most of them in recent weeks; the health ministry reported that two people had died in the past 24 hours in Gaza on Friday. IPC’s report notes that these deaths are likely underreported due to Israel’s destruction of monitoring and health systems.\nIsraeli officials and their propaganda network have denied that there is starvation in Gaza at all. These claims have been thoroughly debunked not just by humanitarian experts, but also, perhaps more importantly, by Palestinians in Gaza who say that famine and starvation is all around them, stalking everyone, adult or child.\nStarvation is a critical part of Israel’s goal of inflicting conditions designed to bring about Palestinians’ physical destruction, as Amnesty International wrote earlier this month — and a key element of Israel’s genocide.\n“In Gaza, survival has been redefined. It is no longer just about fleeing bombs — it is about keeping ourselves from dying of hunger. The echoing question — ‘Where do we go?’ — has now been compounded by another, more desperate one: ‘What can we eat so we don’t collapse?’” wrote Palestinian Hend Salama Abo Helow this month.\nAs the occupying power exercising total control of everything that enters and exits Gaza, Israel has long deprived Palestinians of food and other basic needs in the Strip. For decades, humanitarian groups have warned of widespread food insecurity in Gaza, as well as shortages of water and other human needs as a result of Israel’s blockades.\nAn urgent appeal for your support\nTruthout relies on reader support to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.\nUnfortunately, donations are down.

A famine was projected in Yemen in 2018, but did not materialise, a spokesman told AFP.\n'Haunt us all'\nThe IPC said the crisis was \"entirely man-made\", driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should \"haunt us all\".\n\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" he said.\nGaza's largest hospital struggles to function in 'catastrophic' health situation\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war, the release of all hostages taken by Hamas from Israel, and full humanitarian access to Gaza.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,\" he said.\n'Too weak to cry'\nChildren are particularly hard hit by the lack of food.\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.\n\"The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,\" said Unicef executive director Catherine Russell.\nThe local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98 percent of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said. Livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.\nThe severe deterioration of the health system and the lack of safe drinking water and adequate hygiene compound the crisis.\nGathering information is extremely difficult in Gaza.\nThe IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.\nIsrael's foreign ministry rejected the IPC's assessment as \"political\" and asserted that a \"massive influx of aid\" had entered the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.\nThe Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, COGAT, accused the authors of relying on \"partial data\" and ignoring information provided to them.\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning\nSubscribe"

      "text": "Riyadh: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) on Friday, August 22, voiced deep concern following the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report confirming famine in the Gaza Strip, condemning what it described as genocide committed by Israeli forces against civilians.\nIn a statement, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is “a direct result of the absence of mechanisms to deter and hold accountable the repeated crimes of the Israeli occupation.”\nIt warned that such crimes “will remain a stain on the brow of the international community, especially the permanent members of the Security Council, unless swift action is taken to end the famine and stop the war of extermination against the Palestinian people.”\nEarlier on Friday, the IPC, a global hunger monitor, confirmed that famine has already struck northern Gaza and will likely spread further within weeks.\nAccording to its findings, about 514,000 people—nearly a quarter of the enclave’s population—are facing famine, with numbers expected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September. Roughly 280,000 of those affected live in Gaza City and its surroundings, while the rest are concentrated in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, areas predicted to slip into famine conditions by next month.\nThe announcement by the International Hunger Watch comes as Israel prepares a large-scale military operation to occupy Gaza City, a move that threatens to worsen the humanitarian disaster and push the situation beyond control.\nAccording to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more than 269 people, including 112 children, have already died of starvation.\nSince March, Israel has tightened restrictions on aid and, from May, channelled limited supplies through the so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).” Deadly incidents around distribution points have left thousands dead and injured."

The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report says.\nThe images of skeletal children in Gaza have already caused widespread protests around the world against the Israeli offensive there and prompted some of Israel’s most important Western allies to say they will recognize a Palestinian state. The IPC report brings the facts behind those photographs of starvation into stark relief.\nIt says famine, the most extreme classification of hunger, is occurring in Gaza Governorate and projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates by the end of September.\nDescribing the situation as a “race against time,” the report says at least 132,000 children under the age of 5 could die from acute malnutrition in the coming months.\nThis estimate has doubled since an IPC report in May, showing just how drastically the conditions have worsened in Gaza in recent weeks.\nNearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require an urgent nutrition response.\nThe Ministry of Health in Gaza said Thursday 271 people have so far died in the famine, including 112 children.\nThis is the first time famine has been confirmed in the Middle East. And it’s happened in a 25-mile-long strip of land, where trucks piled with thousands of tons of food are parked at border crossings.\nThe people in Gaza now dying of starvation are never more than a few miles from warehouses filled with food aid that they have no way to reach.\n“This is the direct result of months of deliberate restrictions on aid, the destruction of Gaza’s food, health, and water systems, and relentless bombardment,” Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps, said in response to the statement. “This is a man-made catastrophe, entirely preventable and entirely unconscionable.”\nIsrael was quick to respond to the report. Israel’s Foreign Ministry accused the IPC of publishing “a tailor-made report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign.” It claims “there is no famine in Gaza.” The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, said the report is based “partial and unreliable sources, many of them affiliated with Hamas.” The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted point-by-point arguments against the report, including allegations that it “ignores Israel’s humanitarian efforts and Hamas’s systematic theft.”\nThe Israeli government has repeatedly said its restrictions on aid are to pressure Hamas and prevent its fighters from benefiting from it.\nBut the result has been a breakdown in the aid system for Gaza’s population living under Israeli blockade, even before this war.\nEarlier this month, more than 100 international humanitarian organizations, including Caritas, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders, accused Israel of “weaponizing” aid to help achieve its aims in Gaza. The statement from Aug. 13 said, “Despite claims by Israeli authorities that there is no limit on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, most major international NGOs have been unable to deliver a single truck of lifesaving supplies since 2 March.”\nThey said their operations are hampered by new, more restrictive Israeli regulations for international aid groups, which they say have resulted in Israeli authorities denying dozens of permissions for groups to bring their aid into Gaza. “This obstruction has left millions of dollars’ worth of food, medicine, water, and shelter items stranded in warehouses across Jordan and Egypt, while Palestinians are being starved,” the statement said.\nOn July 29, an IPC alert warned that the “worst-case scenario of famine” was playing out in the Gaza Strip. It underscored the devastating living situation for Gaza’s some 2 million citizens, almost two years since the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prompted a full-scale Israeli military invasion of Gaza.\nAfter Israel tightened restrictions on supplies entering Gaza in mid-March, food dried up. In the weeks that followed, adults prioritized feeding their children over themselves as a coping strategy, which, according to the IPC alert, initially mitigated a rise in acute child malnutrition.\nHowever, by April, supplies had become so scarce that parents could no longer protect their children this way. The IPC alert said that between April and mid-July, over 20,000 children had to be treated for acute malnutrition.\nWhat little sustenance could be found in markets skyrocketed in price. In June, wheat flour prices increased between 1,400% and 5,600% compared to late February. By July, the IPC alert stated nearly 9 out of 10 households had to resort to taking “significant safety risks” to find food and scavenge from garbage.\nThe U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres posted his response to the report on social media. “Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine’,” the U.N. chief said. “This is not a mystery — it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself.”\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was “utterly horrifying” and held Israel responsible. “The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage,” Lammy said in a statement.\nHundreds of civilians have been reported shot dead as they cross dangerous militarized zones to receive supplies from the aid distribution sites of the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The foundation disputes that the killings occur near its centers and says it has distributed 132 million meals.\nBut aid experts say that much of what the group gives out is not ready-to-eat and requires water and fuel for cooking — resources that are hard to come by in Gaza, where Israeli bombardment has devastated critical infrastructure.\nMoreover, experts say the distribution sites are located primarily in militarized zones along the Khan Younis–Rafah border, where less than a quarter of Gaza’s population lives.\nFinding food and resources for cooking has been made all the more difficult by the frequent and often repeated forced displacements of families across the Gaza Strip. The IPC report said some 800,000 people have had to leave their homes in waves of displacement that have forced people to abandon any remaining resources, further disrupted access to essential health services and compounded humanitarian needs.\nThe confirmation of famine comes as Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for Israeli soldiers and 60,000 reservists to move into Gaza City.\nThe U.N. says that already nearly 90% of Gaza is under military control or off-limits to Palestinians. Gaza City is home to tens of thousands of Gazans displaced from other parts of the strip and has several of the territory’s last partially functioning hospitals. The Israeli military has started calling doctors and international organizations in the city, telling them to leave.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel will now resume negotiations for the release of all hostages held in Gaza and an end to the nearly 2-year-old war, but on terms acceptable to Israel. It comes in response to a temporary ceasefire proposal put forward by Egypt and Qatar that Hamas accepted on Monday.\nIsrael will dispatch negotiators to talks once a location is set, an Israeli official said. Netanyahu, however, also said he remained set on approving plans for capturing Gaza City.\nThe talks could offer a moment’s hope to Palestinians desperate for a ceasefire that the experts behind the IPC report say is so desperately needed as a first step to address the famine in Gaza.\nBut for now, the situation in the enclave remains desperate. The United Nations’ World Food Programme said in a recent report that “public order has broken down” and that “after 22 months of fighting, the social fabric of Gaza is collapsing as the fear of starvation intensifies.”\nAlmost all the trucks carrying WFP food aid inside Gaza have been stopped before reaching their destination by civilians desperate to find the sustenance they need for themselves and their families to survive."

      "text": "It’s official. Gaza is now suffering from now a famine. This is what a UN-backed body has declared on Friday. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has determined that Gaza City is in the grips of famine.\nThe IPC says the famine is likely to spread across Gaza in the absence of a ceasefire or Israel loosening its restrictions on aid. The development comes after months of experts warning that Gaza is on the brink of starvation.\nThe IPC in its 59-page report blamed the renewed Israeli offensive, more and more Palestinians being displaced over the past few weeks and a complete Israeli blockade on the territory. It warned that there should be “no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed”.\nIsrael has rejected the report, claiming it is ‘false and biased’ and that is based on ‘partial data originating from the Hamas Terrorist Organisation”.\nBut why has the UN-backed body declared a famine in Gaza City now? How bad is the situation?\nLet’s take a closer look\nWhy declare a famine in Gaza City now?\nFirst let’s take a brief look at the IPC. The IPC is the world’s leading authority on food crises. It comprises experts from nearly two dozen groups including the UN’s health, development, and food aid agencies; charity CARE International; the Famine Early Warning Systems Network; and the European Union and the World Bank.\nNow, let’s look at the IPC’s methodology. The IPC in its report outlined how it classified the situation in Gaza City – which comprises around 20 per cent of the Gaza Strip – as a famine. It said around 50 experts from nearly two dozen organisations examined and collated the data – which was done by merging phone-based surveys and food consumption trends.\nIt said it judged malnutrition via examining arm circumferences in the field. The IPC said it used public health and other “contextual information” was used to approximation mortality. This, it says, is its SOP when there is a surfeit of “reliable data”.\nIt said it also measured “contributing factors” such the war, how many people were displaced, whether or not people could get to markets, the cost of goods, availability of water and sanitation and whether health and nutrition help was available.\nThe IPC says it only surveyed three of Gaza’s governorates – leaving out the depopulated Rafah and North Gaza due to the lack of data. The IPC says it uses three levels to determine the reliability of evidence. It placed the data available in the report as a level 2 – a medium level.\nNow, look at how the IPC classifies food insecurity.\nThe agency does so on a scale of 1 to 5 – with five being the worst.\nIt says Level 5, known as a “catastrophe”, is when “households experience an extreme lack of food and/or cannot meet other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategies”. It says “starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition are evident” during a catastrophe.\nHowever, even this isn’t enough to declare a famine.\nThe IPC only declares a “famine with reasonable evidence” if there is proof that two of three are suffering acute food insecurity, acute malnutrition and mortality.\nA minimum of 20 percent of households must “have an extreme lack of food and face starvation and destitution”, there must be acute malnutrition in at least 30 per cent of children under five and two deaths per 10,000 per day daily as a result of food insecurity.\nHow bad is the situation?\nThe IPC says over 500,000 people in the Gaza Strip are staring at “catastrophic conditions” – the top level in its hierarchy of food insecurity.\nThe IPC says that in the larger Gaza Governorate around 30 per cent of the population is facing catastrophic conditions. Meanwhile, with 50 per cent are staring at an “emergency” – which is one level under catastrophic conditions.\nThe IPC said the situation in North Gaza governorate is believed to be “as severe – or worse – than in Gaza Governorate”. However, it cannot reach a firm conclusion due to the absence of reliable data.\nThe IPC has said Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis governorates will also be the in the grips of famine by September end. The IPC estimates that that 25 and 20 percent of the population in those areas are at a level 5 catastrophe.\nThe IPC has not considered Rafah – Gaza’s southernmost governorate – because it has been largely rendered empty as a result of Israel’s military operations.\nThe 500,000 number, which is based on information gathered between July 1 and August 15, is expected to increase to nearly 641,000 people – nearly a third of the population – by the end of September.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel.\nWhen is a famine declared?\nFamine can appear in pockets — sometimes small ones — and a formal classification requires caution.\nLast year, experts said a famine was ongoing in parts of North Darfur in Sudan. Somalia, in 2011, and South Sudan, in 2017, also saw famines in which tens of thousands of people were affected.\nGaza poses a particular complication for experts since access is severely limited, making gathering data difficult if not impossible in some cases.\nEven more confusingly, there’s no final authority on who gets to declare a famine.\nThe IPC says it is the “primary mechanism” used by the international community to analyse data and conclude whether a famine is happening or projected. However, it doesn’t usually make such a statement itself.\nUN officials or governments usually do so by relying on IPC data.\n“There’s a widespread misunderstanding that someone has to declare a famine before it is a famine. That is not the case,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. “When IPC shows the data that hits the threshold for a famine, then it’s a famine.”\n‘Failure of humanity’\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called the development ‘a failure of humanity’.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine’,” Guterres said.\nHe added that it is “not a mystery,” but rather “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself”.\n“Famine is not only about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,” Guterres added.\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to the Palestinian territory “because of systematic obstruction by Israel”.\nSpeaking in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should “haunt us all”.\n“It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” he told reporters.\nThe IPC noted the local food system has also collapsed, with an estimated 98 per cent of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, livestock decimated and fishing banned.\nTo add to this, the health system has severely deteriorated, while access to safe drinking water and adequate hygiene has been drastically reduced.\nBut Israel’s Foreign Ministry immediately hit back, saying “there is no famine in Gaza”.\nHamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians.\nIsrael’s offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.\nBoth from agencies"

      "text": "A UN-backed body has officially declared famine in Gaza for the first time, causing outrage around the globe – including within the UK government.\nAccording to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said 514,000 people in the Palestinian territory are experiencing famine.\nThat’s approximately a quarter of Gaza’s entire population.\nThe IPC expect this number to rise to 614,000 by the end of September.\nMore than half (around 280,000) of those suffering these severe levels of hunger are based in the northern region covering Gaza City, also called the Gaza governorate.\nAt least 20% of a region has to be suffering from extreme food shortages for it to be called a famine.\nIt usually means one in three children is acutely malnourished, while a further two in every 10,000 people are dying every day from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nThe UN human rights agency said today that the famine is a direct result of Israel’s actions and therefore could amount to a war crime.\nFamine is not a very common occurrence. Previous famines were declared in Somalia in 2011, and in Sudan in 2017, 2020, and 2024.\nA new report from Forensic Architecture and the World Peace Foundation also accused Israel of worsening starvation with a “military model” of aid distribution on Friday.\nThe UK’s foreign secretary David Lammy released a statement today calling the conditions in Gaza a “moral outrage”.\nRead Lammy’s full statement here:\n“The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable.\nThe Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.\nThe IPC report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children. The Government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those who so desperately need them.\nThe Israeli government must allow the UN and international NGOs to carry out their life-saving work without obstruction. Aid must reach those in need urgently and without delay.\nWe desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine.\nThe UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the hostages held by Hamas. We urge the Israeli government to change course and halt its plans.\nThis terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace.”\nLammy was not alone in his fury.\nThe UN’s secretary-general Antonio Guterres wrote on X: “Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine.’”\nHe said it is “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself”.\n“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law — including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,” Guterres said.\n“No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow — it is now. We need an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages and full, unfettered humanitarian access.”\nThe CEO of Save the Children UK, Moazzam Malik, called for “this siege and weaponisation of aid” to end, and for the British government to suspend all arms transfers to Israel.\nHelen Stawski, Oxfam’s policy lead, hit out at Israel too, saying the country has been “denying almost every request from long-established humanitarian agencies, prevent ing them from delivering vital food”.\nShe added: “Oxfam alone has more than $2.5m worth of life-saving aid, including high-calorie food packages – now sitting in warehouses outside Gaza. Israeli authorities have rejected it all, at a time when it is needed more than ever.”\nPlan International UK said the famine was an “entirely man-made hunger catastrophic that is killing Gaza children every day”.\nA nutritional expert working for CARE International, Samah Wadi, in Gaza, said people in the territory are “looking for anything to survive on, to hold onto, even if it means it will only save them for another couple of hours”.\nIsraeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely rejected the famine conclusion.\nWriting on X, she accused the IPC of “amplifying data sourced from Hamas, a designated terrorist organization”.\nShe said: “It is illogical to suggest the situation is worsening when clear evidence shows improvement. This is yet another example of disinformation, promoted by UN agencies and echoed by the media, which only serves Hamas’s propaganda campaign.”\nIsrael has also accused Hamas of stealing aid, an allegation it denies.\nGlobal frustration with Israel is still building, though.\nThe UK joined EU allies and Australia to condemn Israel’s other new plan to construct a settlement east of Jerusalem, known as the E1 area, on Thursday.\nIn a joint statement, each country’s foreign minister – including Lammy – said the plan is “unacceptable and a violation of international law”.\nThe UK’s minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer also said this week that the humanitarian crisis had “reached new depths”.\nHe said: “Israel must immediately and permanently lift all barriers preventing aid reaching the people of Gaza to prevent the horrifying starvation in the Strip continuing.\n“The humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached new depths and that is why we are doing all we can to end the current suffering and change the situation on the ground.\n“We continue to support efforts to bring about an immediate ceasefire. We also need a comprehensive plan to end this misery and get to a long-term settlement that provides peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.”\nA new investigation from the Guardian, +972 Magazine and Local Call found this week that five out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians – even though Israel claimed it was working to wipe out Hamas militants."

My youngest child is four years old - he doesn't know what fruit and vegetables look or taste like.\"\nThe UN says Israel has heavily restricted the amount of aid entering Gaza, which Israel denies.\nIsrael also denies there is starvation in the territory, in direct contradiction to what more than 100 humanitarian groups, witnesses on the ground, and multiple UN bodies say.\nOn Friday, the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City and its surrounding areas.\nIt warned that more than half a million people across the Gaza Strip were facing \"catastrophic\" conditions characterised by \"starvation, destitution and death\".\nRajaa Talbeh, 47, a mother of six, said she had lost 25kg (55lbs) in weight. She fled her home in Gaza City's Zeitoun district a month ago and now lives in a makeshift tent near the beach.\nShe suffers from gluten intolerance and said she could no longer find food she could eat.\n\"Before the war, a charity used to help me get gluten-free products, which I could never afford myself,\" she said.\n\"Since the war began, I can't find what I need in the market, and even when I do, I can't afford it. Isn't it enough to face daily bombardment, displacement and living in a tent that shields us neither from the heat of summer nor the cold of winter - and now famine on top of it?\"\nRida Hijeh, 29, said her five-year-old daughter Lamia's weight had dropped from 19kg (42lbs) to 10.5kg (23lbs).\nShe said Lamia was healthy before the war began and had no prior illnesses.\n\"This all happened only because of the famine,\" she said.\n\"There is simply nothing for the child to eat. There are no vegetables, no fruits.\"\nNow, Lamia suffers from swelling in her legs, thinning hair, and nerve problems, she said.\n\"She cannot walk. I went to many clinics, doctors, and hospitals. They all told me my daughter is suffering from malnutrition. But none of them gave me anything, not treatment, not any support.\"\nMandy Blackman, a British nurse working for the charity UK-Med in Gaza, said 70% of mothers attending their maternal health, ante-natal and post-natal clinics had clinical malnutrition.\n\"Babies are delivered smaller and more vulnerable as a result,\" she said.\nMore than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its military campaign, in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nSince the start of the war, at least 271 people, including 112 children, have died of \"famine and malnutrition\", according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nAnother woman, Aseel, who lives in Gaza City, said: \"Five months ago, I weighed 56kg (123lbs). Today, I weigh only 46kg (101lbs).\"\nShe said she hadn't eaten a single piece of fruit or meat in months and had spent nearly her entire savings on basic ingredients to survive.\nAseel's sister-in-law - who she lives with - has a one-month-old baby.\n\"She's been desperately searching for baby formula at a reasonable price,\" Aseel said.\nShe said that when they can find it, it costs as much as 180 shekels (£39) per can.\n\"I have no food stockpile, not even enough to last a week or two,\" she added.\n\"Like thousands of people, we live day by day.\"\nAdditional reporting by Freya Scott-Turner and Caroline Hawley"

The deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid, the destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure, and the direct killings of civilians are a clear manifestation of how Israel is inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as part of its ongoing genocide.\nThis famine is the direct consequence of Israel’s deliberate campaign of starvation in Gaza.\nErika Guevara Rosas, Amnesty International\nIt is all the more harrowing that [it] is an entirely man-made, deliberately orchestrated and preventable catastrophe\n“The declaration of famine in Gaza City comes as the Israeli cabinet and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have approved plans for a new military operation to ‘take control’ of the city, further entrenching Israel’s unlawful occupation. Launching such an offensive amidst an ongoing famine would not only lead to yet more mass violations of international humanitarian law, but would also deliberately, exponentially intensify the suffering of Palestinians already enduring starvation and rising death tolls from malnutrition.\n“With every hour that passes without decisive international action, more Palestinian lives are lost, and Gaza City edges closer to complete annihilation. History will never forgive us for standing by as emaciated children die, while food remains just miles away, yet blocked by Israel.\n“To even begin reversing the devastating consequences of Israel’s inhumane policies and actions, the world must take action now. All states and actors must forcefully demand that Israel ends this abomination by ensuring the unimpeded flow of aid into and across Gaza, a total lifting of Israel’s illegal blockade, dismantling the deadly militarized aid distribution system and allowing the UN and other trusted humanitarian organizations to distribute aid safely and without arbitrary restrictions. They must also press for an immediate sustained ceasefire by all parties and the rapid return of the hostages held in Gaza as well as of all Palestinians arbitrarily detained by Israel.”"

      "text": "United Nations declares famine in northern Gaza\nAn immediate ceasefire is critical to allow a large-scale humanitarian response that can save lives, the UN said.\nThe United Nations on Friday formally declared a famine in northern Gaza, the first ever confirmed in West Asia.\nThe famine conditions are predicted to spread from the Gaza Governorate to the Deir Al Balah and Khan Younis regions of the besieged Palestinian territory in the coming weeks, the UN cited a new Integrated Food Security Phase Classification analysis as saying in a statement.\nMore than half a million people in the region are trapped in famine conditions, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths, it added.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification is a standardised tool that combines data on food security, nutrition and livelihoods to assess the severity of crises and guide response.\n“Classifying famine means that the most extreme category is triggered when three critical thresholds, extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition and starvation-related deaths, have been breached,” the UN said.\nIsrael’s military offensive in Gaza began in October 2023 after the Palestinian militant group Hamas killed 1,200 persons during its incursion into southern Israel and took hostages. Israel has been carrying out unprecedented air and ground strikes on Gaza since then, leaving more than 62,000 persons dead.\nTel Aviv has enforced a blockade on humanitarian aid, which the UN previously said had brought the population to the brink of famine.\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children in Gaza were identified as acutely malnourished. This was the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year, the UN said on Friday.\nNearly one in four of these children is suffering from severe acute malnutrition, the deadliest form with short and long-term impacts.\nMeanwhile, approximately 98% of the cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible, decimating the agriculture sector and local food production, the UN added.\nNine out of ten persons have been displaced from their homes, it added. Cash is critically scarce and aid operations remain severely disrupted.\nFood prices are extremely high, and there is not enough fuel and water to cook, medicines and medical supplies, the UN statement said.\nGaza’s health system has severely deteriorated, access to safe drinking water and sanitation services have been drastically reduced, while multi-drug resistant infections are surging and levels of morbidity are alarmingly high among children, it added.\nThe statement said: “An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to allow unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response that can save lives.”\nAntónio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, described the famine as a “man-made disaster”, adding that an “an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, and full, unfettered humanitarian access” was required.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine’,” he said in a statement. “This is not a mystery – it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\nHe said that a famine was not only about food but the “deliberate collapse” of the systems needed for human survival. “People are starving,” Guterres said. “Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing.”\nThe secretary-general added: “As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population. We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher described the famine as “entirely preventable”, blaming it on “systematic obstruction by Israel” that has blocked food from reaching Gaza, AFP reported.\nIsrael’s foreign ministry rejected the UN’s findings, saying “there is no famine in Gaza”.\nIsrael and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks since July 6. Earlier efforts to reinstate a brief ceasefire that took effect in January had stalled due to major disagreements between the two sides.\nAlso read: Starvation in Gaza: How Israel is attempting to hide the truth of its brutal war"

      "text": "The United Nations officially declared a famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming \"systematic obstruction\" of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of war, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly dismissing the findings.\nPalestinian militant group Hamas urged the United Nations to \"stop the war and lift the siege\", calling for unrestricted access for food, medicine, water and fuel.\nNetanyahu, whose defence minister meanwhile threatened an even more intense offensive, rejected the UN-backed report as \"an outright lie\".\nThe Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in the Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory including Gaza City.\nIsrael has pressed ahead with plans to seize Gaza City despite an international outcry, saying that taking the territory's largest city is key to defeating Hamas.\nThe IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, covering around two-thirds of Gaza.\nWith the vast majority of the territory's population displaced at least once, the UN said nearly a million people currently live in the northern Gaza governorate.\nUN agencies and aid groups had warned for months of a looming famine in Gaza, where Israel has severely restricted aid and at times completely cut it off during its nearly two-year war with Hamas.\nCOGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories -- including coordinating aid to Gaza -- argued that the IPC's findings rely on \"partial data and unreliable sources\".\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to Palestinians in need \"because of systematic obstruction by Israel\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire, saying: \"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.\"\n- 'Man-made catastrophe' -\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk said it was \"a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\" -- a charge for which the International Criminal Court in November issued an arrest warrants for Netanyahu.\nIn a statement, Netanyahu said \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation\", citing figures on aid it had allowed into Gaza.\nThe IPC report said that \"over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death\".\nIt said the deterioration between July and August was the most severe since it began analysing hunger in Gaza, driven by a sharp escalation in the war and restrictions on supplies.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid from Gaza for two months.\nSpeaking in Geneva, the UN's Fletcher said: \"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said the famine declaration \"must serve as a catalyst for immediate and concrete action\".\nBritain's top diplomat David Lammy said Israel's \"refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.\"\n- 'We are dying' -\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz earlier warned that \"the gates of hell will open upon\" Hamas leaders, specifically in Gaza City, \"until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war, primarily the release of all hostages and their disarmament.\"\nMilitary chief Eyal Zamir said \"we are expanding operations in Gaza in the coming days\".\nLate Thursday, Netanyahu said he had ordered negotiations aimed at freeing the hostages still held in Gaza since the Hamas attack that triggered the war -- 49 people, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.\nThe Israeli premier said the diplomatic push would accompany the operation to take control of Gaza City.\nMediators have been waiting for an official Israeli response to their latest ceasefire proposal, which Hamas accepted earlier this week.\nOn the ground, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 57 people on Friday, more than half of them in Gaza City.\nUmm Mohammed Nasr, a 42-year-old mother of four from Gaza City, said that \"the bombing hasn't stopped since this morning... but we have no idea where to go\".\n\"We are dying,\" she said.\nMedia restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency or the Israeli military.\nHamas's October 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.\nglp-ds/ami/jsa\n(0) comments\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nKeep it Clean.

      "text": "The world's top authority on hunger crises officially declared Friday that a famine of the most severe kind is the reality in Gaza—a humanitarian disaster engineered by Israel's relentless blockade of food aid and other life-saving supplies amid a military campaign that makes little to no distinction between civilians and possible Palestinian fighters living in the occupied enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)—the multi-stakeholder global initiative which integrates international, regional, and national governments and agencies to monitor and respond to food-related emergencies—issued a \"special snapshot\" on the situation in Gaza and determined that \"Famine (IPC Phase 5)—with reasonable evidence—is confirmed in Gaza Governorate.\"\nPhase 5 is the highest level of its famine emergency categories, which, according to the IPC, which means the situation is beyond Category 4 (\"Emergency\") and now represents a \"Catastrophe.\"\n(Image: The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification)\nAccording to the IPC's snapshot assessment:\nAfter 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death. Another 1.07 million people (54 percent) are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), and 396,000 people (20 percent) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\nBetween mid-August and the end of September 2025, conditions are expected to further worsen with Famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while those in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely rise to 1.14 million (58 percent). Acute malnutrition is projected to continue worsening rapidly.\nThrough June 2026, at least 132,000 children under five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition—double the IPC estimates from May 2025. This includes over 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death. Nearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will also require urgent nutrition response.\nDespite limited data, conditions in North Gaza Governorate are estimated to be as severe—or worse—than in Gaza Governorate.\nDownload the complete four-page assessment released Friday. The agency said a more complete assessment of its findings will be put out in the coming weeks.\nHumanitarians, human rights groups, and relief organizations, which for months have desperately warned world leaders that starvation and malnutrition were rapidly spreading, reacted to the IPC designation—given the global community's failure to force Israel into compliance with international law—with a mix of fury and frustration.\n\"Despite warnings in July that famine was imminent, Israel has continued to deprive Palestinians of food, denying almost every request from long-established humanitarian agencies, preventing them from delivering vital food and aid that could have stemmed hunger, malnutrition, and disease,\" said Helen Stawski, the policy lead for Oxfam International.\n(Image: IPC assessment)\nStawski placed the blame squarely on Israel's government for blocking food and other supplies that could otherwise be saving lives.\n\"Oxfam alone has more than $2.5 million worth of life-saving aid, including high-calorie food packages—now sitting in warehouses outside Gaza,\" she said. \"Israeli authorities have rejected it all, at a time when it is needed more than ever.\"\nInger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, rebuked the inaction of global actors who stood by while Israel and its allies allowed to the famine to take hold.\n\"The world has been watching as children have suffered the unthinkable for nearly two years in Gaza, and now, we have confirmation that hundreds of thousands are being slowly starved to death. None of us should accept this,\" said Ashing.\n\"All of Gaza is being systematically starved by design, and children are paying the highest price. The world has failed to act as their tiny, emaciated bodies have been overcome by hunger and disease and shut down,\" she added. \"This engineered famine is the ultimate and inevitable result of the Government of Israel's use of starvation as a weapon of war. The sustained siege on food, medicine, and fuel was bound to lead to this preventable catastrophe. There is no world leader who did not know this was coming, who hasn't been warned again and again.\"\nWhat's urgently needed now, say experts, is an immediate ceasefire and a return to the UN-backed humanitarian aid distribution system that was sidelined by the Israeli and US governments that put the ill-conceived and euphemistically named Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, stocked with private contractors and protected by IDF forces and mercenaries, in charge of food operations that have led to chaos and hundreds of killings around its distribution sites.\nThe IPC assessment called for the following actions in order to end the famine:\n- Immediate and sustained cessation of hostilities\nTo prevent further loss of life and famine from spreading further, an immediate ceasefire and putting an end to the conflict is critical. - Guarantee unconditional and safe humanitarian access\nSafe, stable, and unhindered access must be guaranteed through all entry points, in full respect of international humanitarian law, allowing for lifesaving assistance and essential services to reach all people in need across the Gaza Strip. Access must also be granted urgently to allow for a comprehensive humanitarian assessment, in particular in North Gaza Governorate. - Immediate, large-scale, unobstructed multi-sector humanitarian assistance is needed to avert further destitution, starvation and death. This includes the provision of food, nutrition, health, WASH, shelter, fuel, cooking gas and food production inputs, while safeguarding humanitarian principles. This is also the only way to stop the interception of aid trucks by desperate populations.\n- Protect civilians and critical infrastructure\nEnsure the safety of civilians and humanitarian personnel across the Gaza Strip. Protect and restore critical infrastructure essential for survival and for the functioning of food, health and WASH systems. - Restore commercial flows at scale, market systems, essential services, and local food production.\n\"Famine means there are no more breaking points and no more alarm bells,\" said Ashing. \"The Government of Israel must immediately end the use of starvation as a weapon of war and lift the siege of the Gaza Strip, allowing aid, including food and nutrition supplies, into Gaza at the scale required, and restore electricity, fuel, and water.\"\nThe international community, she concluded, \"must finally take every possible step to stop the Government of Israel from intentionally starving children and families in Gaza.\""

However, the UN and Palestinians in Gaza say that what aid is entering is far below what is needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report on Friday, calling it “false and biased”.\nThe agency, known as COGAT, rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nIn a post on social media, Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs also rejected the findings, saying the IPC report was “based on Hamas lies”.\nIt said that more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks with staple foods.\n“A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nIsrael’s plan to escalate the war in Gaza City weeks after a warning that famine was beginning there demonstrates how “intentional the famine is and how Israel wields starvation”, he said.\nMr Netanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel’s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether."

      "text": "Israel Rejects Claim by UN on Alleged Famine in Gaza\nJerusalem says the report is calculated to produce a ‘false accusation’ against the Jewish state.\nThe United Nations declaration, for the first time, that famine conditions exist in Gaza complicates Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to end the war, while it helps Hamas to add demands in diplomatic negotiations.\nIsrael is rejecting a report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, known as IPC, according to which level-five famine, the highest level of food scarcity, exists in Gaza “with reasonable evidence.”\nThe IPC “has just published a ‘tailor-made’ fabricated report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign,” the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement posted on X. “Unbelievably, the IPC twisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria just to produce false accusations against Israel.”\nAccording to the Israel Defense Forces, most of the data the report relied on are from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. The IPC, according to officials, changed its own criterion to fit the report, even as up to 100,000 aid trucks have entered Gaza since the start of the war. An additional recent “flood” of aid caused a sharp decline in food staple prices in the Strip, easing hunger there, they say.\n“The laws of supply and demand don’t lie — the IPC does,” according to the Israeli foreign ministry. While Jerusalem rejects the report, Israel’s detractors seize on it as proof that the war in Gaza must end. It is published just as the IDF is making final preparations to enter Hamas’s most significant remaining stronghold at Gaza City.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine,’” the UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. The Gaza famine, he adds, is “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.” He urged “an immediate ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages, and full, unfettered humanitarian access,” and said the time to take those steps is “not tomorrow, it is now.”\nOn Thursday Mr. Netanyahu visited the IDF’s Gaza Division that is amassing troops outside of the strip. Entering Gaza City, he said, represents the war’s “decisive stage.”\nThe IDF is already acting, from the air and on the ground, in the southern and northeastern edges of Gaza City. The plan, approved Friday by the defense minister, Israel Katz, envisions the evacuation of non-combatants among the city’s 900,000 residents to the Strip’s southern area, before a final assault on Hamas fighters left behind.\nThe civilians would be relocated to a tent city in southern Gaza, where they would be supplied with life necessities. IDF officials have alerted Gaza City hospitals and other institutions of the plan, urging them to prepare to move medical equipment and patients to the south.\nEven as those plans seem to get well on the way, Mr. Netanyahu said he has instructed his team “to begin immediate negotiations for the release of all our hostages and the end of the war, on conditions that are acceptable for Israel.” As of yet, no venue to such negotiations has been determined.\nFor days the premier’s office has indicated that the military takeover of Gaza City might be suspended if negotiations on releasing all hostages conclude to Israel’s satisfaction. “Those two things, the defeat of Hamas and the release of all our hostages, go hand in hand,” Mr. Netanyahu said Thursday.\nJerusalem officials claim that the mere threat of a Gaza City takeover has already moved Hamas to accept a deal that it has rejected two months ago. Washington officials have blamed Hamas for the deadlock in negotiations.\n“The problem has always been that just when we think that things are ready to be resolved, Hamas changes the terms, they put new demands on the table, most of which become utterly unacceptable, and it all falls apart,” the American ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, told Israel’s Arabic-language station Makan 33 on Friday.\nHamas previously rejected a proposal made by President Trump’s special envoy, Steven Witkoff, which Israel accepted. It envisioned a two-month cease-fire, an increase in aid to Gaza, and the release of hundreds of terrorists in Israeli prisons in return for 10, or half, of the living Israeli hostages, and nearly 20 bodies of dead hostages.\nThis week, Hamas officials announced that they now accept an Egyptian proposal, which made mere cosmetic changes to the original Witkoff plan. Mr. Netanayhu, though, is yet to agree, and he now demands a new agreement, in which Hamas would release all remaining 50 hostages, dead and alive, and disarm.\nMr. Netanyahu might rely on his confidence that pressure and the fear of losing its control over Gaza City would force Hamas to release the hostages. The IPC famine report is now bound to increase global pressure on Israel, and to stiffen Hamas’s negotiation stance."

      "text": "Famine has officially been declared in war-torn Gaza in what has been branded a “deep stain on our collective humanity”.\nChildren are among hundreds already said to have perished from malnutrition-related deaths as the stricken enclave stands in ruins after nearly two years of bombardment by Israel. But the official declaration of famine marks a significant step in the humanitarian crisis. The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) made the formal declaration today that famine is occurring in Gaza City – warning it is expected to spread south. The grim milestone is only the fifth time it has declared famine, after Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in both 2017 and 2020 and Sudan last year.\nThe IPC said today: \"As of 15 August 2025, Famine (IPC Phase 5)—with reasonable evidence—is confirmed in Gaza Governorate. After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death. Another 1.07 million people (54 percent) are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), and 396,000people (20 percent) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).\n\"Between mid-August and the end of September 2025, conditions are expected to further worsen with Famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while those in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely rise to 1.14 million (58 percent).\"\nIt added: \"Acute malnutrition is projected to continue worsening rapidly. Through June 2026, at least132,000 children under five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition—double the IPC estimates from May 2025. This includes over 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death. Nearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require urgent nutrition response.\"\nMeanwhile, it explained: \"Conditions in North Gaza Governorate are estimated to be as severe—or worse—than in Gaza Governorate. However, limited data prevents IPC classification of this area, highlighting the urgent need for access and comprehensive assessments.\"\nThe IPC defines famine as being “a situation in which at least one in five households has an extreme lack of food and face starvation and destitution, resulting in extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition and death”. The Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the IPC's report, calling it \"false and biased\". The agency, known as COGAT, rejected there was famine in Gaza, saying significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, labelling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.\nBut Taahra Ghazi, co-CEO of ActionAid UK, said: “That famine should be officially confirmed in Gaza for the first time by the IPC despite months of repeated warnings, and despite it being entirely preventable, is a deep stain on our collective humanity. Let there be no doubt: this is an entirely engineered famine and the direct result of the Israeli authorities’ deliberate blocking of food, water and other humanitarian aid into Gaza, which breaches international humanitarian law.\n\"It is utterly shameful that, for so many months, the Israeli authorities have used starvation as a weapon of war with impunity: now we are seeing the calamitous consequences play out. Malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed their babies; our own staff and partners are dizzy and exhausted because they give any food they can find to their children and go hungry themselves.”\nIt comes as Israel’s defence minister has warned Gaza City could be destroyed unless Hamas accepts its terms, with the country preparing for an expanded offensive in the area. After Netanyahu said he would authorise the military to seize Gaza City, Israel Katz warned the enclave's largest city could \"turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun\" - areas reduced to rubble earlier in the war.\nMr Katz wrote on X: \"The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas' murderers and rapists in Gaza - until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war.\" He restated Israel's ceasefire demands to release all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament. Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.\nGhazi added: “People in Gaza City are already experiencing famine: now they are in the midst of an intensified assault by the Israeli military and facing a full ground offensive, which would forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of people and severely disrupt humanitarian operations at a time when they are needed more than ever. It is difficult to stress just how much more dire the situation will become if it goes ahead.\n\"There is now a race against time to stop this famine from becoming any further entrenched. Every hour counts and there is no time to waste. The international community must take meaningful action and use diplomatic pressure to bring about a permanent ceasefire immediately. Food and other aid must be allowed to enter Gaza unhindered, rapidly and at scale if there is to be any hope of preventing any more deaths by starvation.”\nFaten, Senior Project Officer with WEFAQ, ActionAid’s partner in Gaza, said: “In the past two months, I have lost 20 kilograms. My children have lost weight and are malnourished. We haven’t had proper meals for three days. I am exhausted, dizzy, and terrified my children will get sicker. I cry daily. This is the first time in my life I have wished I didn’t have children – because watching them waste away is unbearable.”\nMeanwhile, Dr Ra’ed Al-Baba, who works at Al Awda Hospital, run by ActionAid’s partner Al-Awda, said: “There are mothers who resort to using legume water, herbs, and other alternatives to infant milk because of the severe shortage. These methods carry catastrophic risks, causing gastroenteritis, food poisoning, delayed growth, severe anaemia, and even the inability to move. We have seen cases of extreme dehydration from polluted water mixed with these substitutes. This is not survival, this is slow death.”\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news from the Irish Mirror direct to your inbox: Sign up here."

      "text": "Famine has struck Gaza, will likely spread, says global hunger monitor\nUNITED NATIONS, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Famine has struck an area of Gaza and will likely spread over the next month, a global hunger monitor determined on Friday, an assessment that will escalate pressure on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the war-torn Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people - nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza - are experiencing famine and that was due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City - known as Gaza governorate - which the IPC said was in famine, its first such determination in the enclave. The rest are in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis - central and southern areas that the IPC projected would be in famine by the end of next month.\nIsrael dismissed the report as \"false and biased\", with the military body that coordinates aid deliveries into Gaza saying the IPC had based its survey on \"partial data originating from the Hamas Terrorist Organisation\".\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached \"unimaginable levels\" after nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has long warned of an \"epic humanitarian catastrophe\" in the enclave of more than 2 million people.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation.\nISRAEL CONTROLS GAZA ACCESS\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said on Friday the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and overlooked a recent increase in food supplies taken into the territory.\n\"COGAT firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City,\" the agency said, denouncing the report as \"unprofessional\".\nThe U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC - an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organizations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65% of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of U.S. public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict.\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Don Durfee, Stephen Coates and Crispian Balmer, Editing by William Maclean)"

      "text": "Updated 5.40pm\nThe United Nations on Friday officially declared a famine in Gaza, the first time it has done so in the Middle East, with experts warning 500,000 people face \"catastrophic\" hunger.\n\"It is a famine: the Gaza famine,\" said Tom Fletcher, the UN's emergency relief coordinator.\nHe blamed Israel, accusing it of \"systematic obstruction\" of aid deliveries to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.\nIsrael's foreign ministry said the declaration that famine is now present in and around Gaza City was \"based on Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests\".\n\"There is no famine in Gaza,\" it insisted.\nThe assessment of famine was made by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC), a coalition of monitors tasked by the UN to warn of impending crises.\nIt defines famine as occurring when 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food; 30 per cent of children under five are acutely malnourished; and at least two in every 10,000 people die daily from outright starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\nUN agencies have for months been warning of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has worsened as Israel steps up its offensive against Hamas.\nThe Rome-based IPC said that \"as of 15 August 2025, famine (IPC Phase 5) -- with reasonable evidence -- is confirmed in Gaza governorate\", the area that encompasses Gaza City and its surroundings.\nThe UN estimates that nearly one million people currently live in the Gaza governorate.\n\"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,\" the IPC report said.\nIt projected that famine would spread to the Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, potentially encompassing nearly 641,000 people.\nThe IPC said it was \"the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region\".\nA famine was projected in Yemen in 2018 but never officially materialised, despite the humanitarian crisis in the country, a spokesman told AFP.\n'Haunt us all'\nThe IPC said the famine in Gaza was \"entirely man-made\", driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should \"haunt us all\".\n\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" he said.\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\".\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in the war, the release of all hostages taken by Hamas from Israel, and full humanitarian access to Gaza.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,\" he said.\nThe International Red Cross described the declaration of famine as \"devastating and entirely foreseeable\".\n\"Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met,\" it said in a statement.\n'Too weak to cry'\nChildren are particularly hard hit by the lack of food.\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished -- a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.\n\"The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,\" said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.\nThe local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98 percent of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said. Livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.\nThe severe deterioration of the health system and the lack of safe drinking water and adequate hygiene compound the crisis.\nGathering information is extremely difficult in Gaza.\nThe IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.\nIsrael's foreign ministry rejected the IPC's assessment as \"political\" and asserted that a \"massive influx of aid\" had entered the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.\nThe Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, COGAT, accused the authors of relying on \"partial data\" and ignoring information provided to them."

      "text": "Famine has officially struck Gaza: Global hunger monitor\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the Gaza famine is a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\".\nUNITED NATIONS: Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine, and it will likely spread, a global hunger monitor determined on Friday (Aug 22), an assessment that will escalate pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system said 514,000 people - nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza - are experiencing famine, with the number due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City - known as Gaza governorate - which the IPC said was in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Hamas.\nIt was the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but said limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael dismissed the report as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\n\"There is no famine in Gaza,\" the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine, at least 20 per cent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the Gaza famine was a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\".\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\n\"People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing ... We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.\"\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached \"unimaginable levels\".\nUS President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with some in his Republican party, who have staunchly supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation and blamed Hamas for creating food shortages.\nISRAEL CONTROLS GAZA ACCESS\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n\"The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas' propaganda campaign,\" the agency said.\nThe UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the UN-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC - an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organisations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65 per cent of Americans believe the US should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the US, its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of US public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on Oct 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict."

Another 1.07 million people – 54 percent of the population – are facing emergency (IPC Phase 4), and 396,000 people (20 percent) are in crisis (IPC Phase 3).\nConditions are expected to further worsen between mid-August and the end of September 2025, with famine projected to expand to the central Deir el-Balah and southern Khan Younis areas.\nBy the end of this period, almost a third of the population of Gaza – nearly 641,000 people – is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while the number of people in emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely increase to 1.14 million, or some 58 percent of the population.\nThis marks the most severe deterioration since the IPC partnership – which comprises 21 organisations including UN agencies, NGOs, technical agencies and regional bodies – began analysing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in the Gaza Strip.\nIt also marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in Gaza.\nThe IPC global initiative described the situation as “a race against time”, adding that “famine must be stopped at all costs”.\nIt warned that acute malnutrition was projected to continue worsening “rapidly”.\nAt least 132,000 children under the age of five will be at risk of death from acute malnutrition by June 2026, it said. This number has doubled compared with the IPC estimates reported in May 2025.\nThis includes at least 41,000 severe cases at heightened risk of death.\nNearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require an urgent nutrition response, the IPC initiative added.\n‘Man-made disaster’\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Gaza’s famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\n“Famine is not only about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival,” Guterres said. “People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing.”\nThe UN chief said Israel, as the occupying power, has “unequivocal obligations” under international law, including the duty to unsure that food and medical supplies are made available to the population of Gaza.\n“We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,” he said. “No more excuses. The time for action is not tomorrow – it is now.”\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said Gaza’s famine was taking place “within a few hundred metres of food,” as aid trucks remain stuck at land crossings amid Israeli restrictions on commercial and humanitarian deliveries.\n“It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war,” Fletcher told a press conference.\nIn a plea to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Fletcher demanded that Israel “end the retribution” and open Gaza’s crossings for unrestricted access.\n“Let us get food and other supplies in and at the massive scale required,” he said. “For humanity’s sake, let us in.”\nDirector-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said “this man-made, widespread malnutrition means that even common and usually mild diseases like diarrhoea are becoming fatal, especially for children.”\n“Gaza must be urgently supplied with food and medicines,” he said on X, and called for an end to “aid blockages.”\n‘No famine’ in Gaza\nIsrael does not accept that there is widespread malnutrition among Palestinians in Gaza and disputes the hunger fatality figures, arguing that the deaths are due to other medical causes.\nResponding to the IPC report, Israel’s foreign ministry said there was “no famine in Gaza”.\n“Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets,” the ministry said in a statement.\nPalestinian group Hamas said Israel’s “criminal denial of this documented fact, and its false claims that there is no famine in Gaza, reveal a criminal mentality that deliberately lies to cover up the murder by starvation practiced against children, women, and the sick, in flagrant defiance of all international laws and norms.”\nIt added that the international community “bears an urgent legal and moral responsibility to stop crimes against humanity and save more than two million people facing genocide, starvation, and the systematic destruction of all necessities of life”.\nAhead of the report’s release, the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, preemptively attacked its findings. “You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilised Hamas savages,” he wrote on X.\n“Maybe the over fed terrorists could share some of their warehouse full they stole with hungry people especially the hostages”.\nIsrael has been insisting that Hamas is starving the remaining Israeli captives in Gaza, some of whom appeared emaciated in recent footage released by the Palestinian group.\nIsrael imposed a total blockade on Gaza in March and has severely restricted aid entering the territory since May, routing supplies via the controversial Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) scheme.\nAccording to the UN, more than 1,300 people seeking food supplies have been killed since late May, including 859 at GHF aid distribution sites, which are under the control of the Israeli military and private US contractors.\nStarvation used as a ‘weapon of war’\nSeveral NGOs reacted to the IPC report echoing the UN’s warnings of deliberate starvation.\nThe UK-based Oxfam said the famine in Gaza was “entirely driven by Israel’s near-total blockade on food and vital aid, the horrifying consequence of Israel’s violence, and its use of starvation as a weapon of war.”\n“This is what our staff and partners have been witnessing for months – people in the Gaza Strip being deliberately starved, relentlessly bombarded and forcefully displaced,” Oxfam’s Helen Stawski said in a statement.\nSave the Children said Gaza was being “systematically starved by design, and children are paying the highest price.”\n“This engineered famine is the ultimate and inevitable result of the Government of Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon of war,” the organisation said. “The sustained siege on food, medicine and fuel was bound to lead to this preventable catastrophe. There is no world leader who did not know this was coming, who hasn’t been warned again and again.”\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) said it was “appalled” by the IPC report, which “confirms the unthinkable.”\n“Famine is now a deadly reality in Gaza City,” it said in a statement. “This devastating milestone confirms what humanitarians have warned for months: famine is no longer a looming threat—it is a deadly reality with catastrophic hunger tightening its grip across the population.”\n“This is not a natural disaster, it is a man-made catastrophe, unfolding in full view of the world and entirely preventable,” it added."

It applied the classification to an area home to 514,000 displaced Palestinians - nearly quarter of Gaza's population.\nWhile the body has previously warned that famine was imminent across Gaza, it had stopped short of making a formal declaration.\nThe IPC is the globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity.\nIt is an initiative involving 21 aid organisations, as well as several United Nations agencies.

That includes at least 112 children.\nThe IPC said that through to June 2026, at least 132,000 children under five were expected to suffer from acute malnutrition - double the estimate from May this year.

      "text": "Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The top global hunger monitoring agency Friday declared a famine affecting more than half a million people in a part of Gaza that includes Gaza City as Israeli forces laid siege to the city in an effort to pressure Hamas ahead of negotiations to release hostages in exchange for a cease-fire.\nFamine had been confirmed with the number of people affected a little under 514,000, out of a total population of 2 million, with that number forecast to rise to 641,000 by the end of September, according to a report by the Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nPeople affected were facing \"starvation, destitution and death.\"\nThe IPC's definition of famine is when at least 20% of households in a defined area are facing an extreme lack of food, acute malnutrition affects at least 30% of children and the daily death toll from starvation reaches a minimum threshold of two adults, or four children, per 10,000 head of population.\nHowever, the IPC said that, due to a lack of data, it had to use an alternate measure to arrive at its conclusion, which is met when 15% of children were suffering from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their mid-upper arm, together with other underlying evidence.\nThe IPC said it also projected conditions it described as \"catastrophic\" would spread southwards to the Deir al Balah and Khan Younis areas during the same timeframe if the humanitarian situation did not improve.\n\"Famine is a race against time. An immediate cease-fire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives,\" it added.\nIsrael denied there was a famine in Gaza and accused the IPC of faking the report, altering its methodology to suit its anti-Israel bias.\nFriday's announcement was only the fourth time the organization, which is backed by the United Nations and 19 other intergovernmental bodies and NGOs, had declared famine in its more than two-decade-long history.\nHumanitarian groups and global health agencies, including the United Nations, World Food Program and World Health Organization, said they had been expecting the news.\n\"Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: 'famine'. This is not a mystery -- it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself,\" said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\"Famine is not only about food; it is the deliberate collapse of the systems needed for human survival. People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing,\" he said.\nGuterres said international law was absolutely clear on Israel's obligation to ensure food and medical supplies for the population.\n\"A cease-fire is an absolute and moral imperative now. The world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine,\" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nBut U.S. and Israeli officials condemned the report, with the foreign ministry in Jerusalem alleging it was a \"fabricated report to Hamas' fake campaign,\" while Mike Huckabee, the United States' Ambassador to Israel, drew attention to the starvation being endured by Israeli hostages.\n\"Maybe the overfed terrorists could share some of their warehouse full they stole with hungry people, especially the hostages,\" he said.\nHowever, the World Peace Foundation told the BBC that the method to determine famine that the IPC used was accepted standard practice and was not a \"lowered or new threshold.\"\n\"Israel won't permit humanitarian data collection and then complains about the quality of the data,\" said WPF executive director Alex de Waal."

An immediate ceasefire is needed, and at the same time, Hamas must release the hostages immediately and unconditionally,\" Alabali Radovan added.\nUN human rights chief says starving Gaza could amount to 'war crime'\nVolker Türk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the famine declared by a UN-backed body in parts of northern Gaza is a \"direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government.\"\nHe added that \"it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare.\"\nTürk's statement to reporters came after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said it had \"reasonable evidence\" that a famine is occurring.\nA formal declaration of famine by the IPC meets three criteria: at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to \"outright starvation.\"\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was preventable if the UN had not been barred from delivering food aid.\n\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" Fletcher said.\nIsrael has denied the IPC assessment of famine, saying the report was based on \"methodological flaws\" and \"unreliable sources.\"\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Friday described conditions in the Gaza Strip as a \"man-made disaster,\" adding that Israel was obliged under international law to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid.\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity,\" he added.\nIsrael rejects IPC report on Gaza famine\nIsrael on Friday rejected a UN-backed report by a global hunger monitor declaring that a famine is currently occurring in Gaza City.\nAn Israeli Foreign Ministry statement said there was no famine in Gaza, and that the food security report was \"based on Hamas lies laundered through organizations with vested interests.\"\nThe world's foremost authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said earlier Friday that it has \"reasonable evidence\" that famine has been occurring in Gaza Governorate, an administrative region, which includes Gaza City, since August 15.\nIt is the first time the IPC has declared a famine in the Middle East.\nCOGAT, the Israeli authority that coordinates civil affairs regarding Palestinians, also rejected the IPC findings, accusing Hamas of carrying out a \"false starvation campaign.\"\n\"COGAT firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City. Previous reports and assessments by the IPC have repeatedly been proven inaccurate and do not reflect the reality on the ground,\" it said.\nIsrael has previously announced measures to allow more aid into Gaza. Humanitarian organizations have warned for months that the level of food aid is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of the population.\nIsrael says Gaza City will be destroyed if Hamas doesn't disarm\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned on Friday that Gaza City would be completely destroyed if Hamas does not agree on Israel's conditions for ending the war, which include the release of all hostages and complete disarmament.\n\"Soon, the gates of hell will open upon the heads of Hamas's murderers and rapists in Gaza — until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war,\" Katz posted on X after operational plans for military action in Gaza City were approved.\nKatz added that if Hamas militants did not agree to the terms, Gaza City would end up like the cities of Rafah and Beit Hanoun, which have been largely razed by Israeli bombing since the start of the war in October 2023. Hamas has rejected disarming as part of a ceasefire deal.\nGaza City is one of the last places in the entire Palestinian enclave that still has basic operating infrastructure.\nIsrael's plans to take over Gaza City have been widely condemned as exacerbating an ongoing humanitarian crisis among Palestinians in the territory, while potentially endangering the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas militants.\nKatz said the plans include relocating Gaza City's residents, which number around 1 million plus hundreds of thousands of people displaced from other parts of Gaza.\nHumanitarian organizations have said another mass displacement of Palestinians is unfeasible, since other areas of the enclave have been largely destroyed and there are not enough operational medical facilities outside of Gaza City.\nThe operational plans for the Gaza City offensive were approved Thursday after a meeting of the Israeli Security Council.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Hamas militants are continuing to organize attacks from Gaza City, and the military mission is to destroy the militant's stronghold while pushing to rescue the remaining hostages, of which around 20 are believed to still be alive.\nStarvation, destitution and death grip Gaza, UN-backed assessment says\nParts of Gaza are now experiencing famine, marked by widespread starvation, destitution and death, according to the latest report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\nMore than half a million people are facing the most severe, or \"catastrophic,\" levels of food insecurity, the UN-backed assessment found.\nThis is the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the territory.\nA further one million people, more than half the population, are in an emergency situation, while nearly 400,000 are in crisis, the report said.\nIn order to declare a famine, the IPC has three criteria, at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 die each day due to \"outright starvation.\"\nConditions are expected to worsen between mid-August and the end of September, with famine projected to spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.\nAfter a global outcry at Israel's severe restrictions on aid from March, the Israeli military began allowing a limited amount of food into Gaza in late July.\nThe findings come as Israel has renewed military operations in Gaza City.\nWelcome to our coverage\nOn Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a plan to capture Gaza City and floated the idea of fresh ceasefire negotiations with Hamas.\nOn Friday morning, his defense minister threatened to open \"the gates of hell\" if the militant group doesn't agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war in Gaza.\nMeanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the world's leading hunger monitor, has officially declared a famine in parts of Gaza.\nWe'll be covering reactions to all of this, along with other developments from across the Middle East, right here in this blog."

      "text": "Famine determined in parts of Gaza, 500,000 experiencing 'catastrophic' hunger: Report\nFamine is projected to expand to central and southern Gaza by end of September.\nFamine has been determined in Gaza Governorate, where Gaza City is located, according to a warning issued Friday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\nThe report from IPC -- a global initiative monitoring hunger with the backing of governments, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations -- projected famine would expand to Deir al-Balah Governorate, in central Gaza, and Khan Younis Governorate, in southern Gaza, by the end of September.\nThe IPC itself doesn't issue official declarations of famine, but its findings can inform governments and bodies such as the U.N. to make a famine declaration.\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, said in a statement Friday it \"firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City,\" alleging that the IPC report \"is based on partial and unreliable sources, many of them affiliated with Hamas.\"\nThe report also found that more than half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing Phase 5 conditions, which are characterized as catastrophic levels of food insecurity. About 1.07 million people, 54% of the population, are facing Phase 4 conditions, characterized as emergency levels of food insecurity.\nBetween mid-August and the end of September 2025, almost a third of the population -- nearly 641,000 people -- are expected to face Phase 5 catastrophic conditions and the number of people facing emergency levels will likely increase to 1.14 million, according to the report.\nThe IPC report stated that, given the inability to classify North Gaza due to barriers reaching the area, the figures in the report are an underestimate. Estimates also exclude any remaining population in Rafah, in southern Gaza, because it is mostly uninhabited, according to the IPC.\nIn a statement on Friday, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office called the IPC's declaration of famine in parts of Gaza \"an outright lie\" and \"a modern blood libel.\"\n\"Israel, will continue to act responsibly, ensuring aid reaches Gaza's civilians while destroying Hamas's terror machine,\" the statement read, in part.\nThe food crisis in Gaza has worsened since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended in March and Israel instituted a blockade on aid into Gaza. An increasing number of deaths attributed to malnutrition have also been reported and gut-wrenching images have emerged of suffering children and long food lines.\nIsraeli said the 11-week blockade, from mid-March to late May of this year, was instituted to pressure Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken during Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023,\nIn mid May, multiple doctors and international aid workers told ABC News that water, food, medicine and medical supplies were running low, and in some cases running out completely.\nThis led to the creation of the Israeli- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which set up designated aid distribution sites rather than delivering aid throughout the strip. Palestinians and aid organizations reported incidents of people being shot at while trying to retrieve aid as well as general chaos at the sites, which continues to be an ongoing issue.\nAmid ongoing international pressure, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began coordinating aid air drops in Gaza with countries including Jordan. Humanitarian organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, have said airdrops are \"ineffective and dangerous.\"\nThe report also found that, through June 2026, at least 132,000 children under age 5 are at risk of death from acute malnutrition, about double the IPC estimates reported in May 2025.\nThe IPC added that this is the first time a famine has officially been confirmed in the Middle East.\nTo determine if a famine is happening, according to IPC, three thresholds have to be met: 20% of households must be facing an extreme food shortage, 30% of children must be acutely malnourished and either two adults or four children must be dying every day per 10,000 people.\nDuring a press briefing in Geneva on Friday, U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine determination should be \"a moment of collective shame.\"\n\"Everyone owns this, the Gaza famine is the world's famine. It is a famine that asks, 'But what did you do?' A famine that will and must haunt us all,\" Fletcher told reporters. \"We all have to look back as the international community and think where could we have got this in a different place. And we've watched it happen in real time.\"\nIn a statement, Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, CEO of Mercy Corps, an aid organization that provides humanitarian services in Gaza, said the confirmation of famine is \"absolutely horrifying yet not surprising\" and a situation that was \"entirely preventable.\"\nD'Oyen McKenna said Mercy Corps has aid, including food kits, hygiene supplies and shelter material at the Gaza border waiting for permission to enter -- enough to help 160,000 people -- but claims it has been blocked for months.\nShe said that, as a result, 2,700 of Mercy Corps' food kits have items that have already expired.\n\"There is still time to save lives, but only if Israeli authorities enable humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded and at the scale needed; if aid workers have the safety guarantees to move freely and reach civilians in urgent need of help; if electricity and water systems are fully restored and sustained; and if health and nutrition services can function,\" D'Oyen McKenna's statement read, in part. \"What we are witnessing in Gaza is a moral failing of the highest order. The world knows how to stop a famine -- we just need the will to act.\"\nIsraeli officials have said there are hundreds of truckloads of aid sitting at the border for the U.N. to distribute. In late July, ABC News' Ian Pannell visited an aid station in Gaza that had stacks of undelivered food. An IDF spokesperson said it was the international community's responsibility to deliver it, but the U.N. said it can't deliver the aid safely.\nA spokesperson for COGAT said Saturday in response to claims from Mercy Corps and other organizations about aid being held up that the \"reality is entirely the opposite of the claims that were published.\"\nThe spokesperson said, \"Israel acts to allow and facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, while the terrorist organization Hamas seeks to exploit the aid to strengthen its military capabilities and consolidate its control over the population. This is sometimes done under the cover of certain international aid organizations, whether knowingly or unknowingly.\"\nIn late July, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the idea that Israel is applying a campaign of starvation in Gaza is \"a bold-faced lie,\" adding that \"there is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.\"\nIsraeli officials have long accused Hamas of stealing aid meant for civilians, which Hamas denies.\nA USAID analysis appeared to undercut some of the assertions about the extent to which Hamas had allegedly stolen humanitarian aid. A presentation reviewed by ABC News, examining more than 150 reported incidents involving the theft or loss of U.S.-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza, showed that the group failed to find any evidence that Hamas engaged in widespread diversion of aid to cause the amount of hunger seen in the strip.\nUSAID officials say their findings indicate that in the majority of cases involving the loss of aid, the perpetrator could not be definitively identified."

      "text": "The world's leading authority on food crises says the Gaza Strip's largest city is gripped by famine, and that it is likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, today said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nThe IPC determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel's restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing high levels of starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nThe grim milestone — the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East — is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been in a brutal war with Hamas since the militant group's October 7, 2023, attack.\nIsrael says it plans to soon escalate the war by seizing Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, which experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said.\nLast month, the IPC said the \"worst-case scenario of famine\" was unfolding in Gaza, but stopped short of an official determination.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.\nAfter the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the UN and Palestinians in Gaza say what's entering is far below what's needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory rejected the report Friday, calling it \"false and biased\". The agency, known as COGAT, rejected the claim that there was famine in Gaza and said that significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\n\"A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,\" said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nIsrael's plan to escalate the war in Gaza City weeks after a warning that famine was beginning there demonstrates how \"intentional the famine is and how Israel wields starvation\", he said.\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel's goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\nHow a famine is determined\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.\nThe IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\n- At least 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving.\n- At least 30 per cent of children six months to five years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height.\n- A least two people, or four children under five, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nIsrael's offensive and its restrictions on access to Gaza have made collecting data difficult.\nThe data analysed between July 1 and August 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza's population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\nAlex de Waal, author of Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n\"Sadly, it seems that it's necessary for experts to shout 'famine!' before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,\" he said.\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.\nIsrael eased those restrictions in May and says there's currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. But it also pushed ahead with a new US-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\nThe traditional, UN-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\nWitnesses, health officials and the UN rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\nA parent in Gaza City watches his children waste away\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people.\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighbourhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City's Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhoea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished.\nIf Israel evacuates people from the city ahead of its new offensive, thousands will be too weak to leave, said Blacka.\n\"Because of the starvation it will put extra strain on already depleted bodies and will lead to the death of many of the Palestinians,\" she said.\nFamilies in Gaza City say they're watching their loved ones waste away.\nYousef Sbeteh's two teenage children were injured by shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they've both lost weight because there hasn't been enough food, he said, adding that he can't afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.\nHis 15-year-old daughter Aya lost nearly 20 kilograms, or about 30 per cent of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms. The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n\"Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,\" Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter.\n\"But I can't provide that now.\"\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

biased\".\nFamine has has been declared in an area of Gaza and will likely spread over the next month, a global hunger monitor has determined.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people — nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza — are experiencing famine and that was due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City — known as Gaza governorate — which the IPC said was in famine, its first such determination in the enclave.\nThe rest are in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis — central and southern areas that the IPC projected would be in famine by the end of next month.\nIsrael dismissed the report as \"false and biased\", with the military body that coordinates aid deliveries into Gaza saying the IPC had based its survey on \"partial data originating from the Hamas Terrorist Organisation\".\n\"In recent weeks, a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food price,\" Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\"This assessment too will be thrown into the despicable trash bin of political documents.\"\nVice President of the Palestinian Australian New Zealand Medical Association (PANZMA), Doctor Muntaser Musameh, told ABC's The World he believed the situation was worse in the north of Gaza, where the IPC was unable to access because it was too dangerous.\nHe said the total number of people starving was likely higher than the report found.\n\"There probably will be at least a million people who are in dire famine situation,\"Mr Musameh said.\n\"We need to act immediately … other parts of Gaza hasn't been able to declare that [famine] because of a lack of access to the evidence.\n\"We need our government to act now and to try to put pressure to allow all the medical aid and all the food to go in before the deaths spiral uncontrollably.\"\nUN chief says famine a direct result of Israeli government actions\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20 per cent of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached \"unimaginable levels\" after nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has long warned of an \"epic humanitarian catastrophe\" in the enclave of more than 2 million people.\nUS President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation.\nIsrael controls Gaza access\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza.\nCOGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said on Friday the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and overlooked a recent increase in food supplies taken into the territory.\n\"COGAT firmly rejects the claim of famine in the Gaza Strip, and particularly in Gaza City,\" the agency said, denouncing the report as \"unprofessional\".\nTess Ingram is in Gaza for UNICEF and told ABC's The World the report \"is our worst fears being realised\".\n\"I've been at nutrition clinics where UNICEF has been treating pregnant women and babies these last two days, and many of the parents I spoke to are at their absolute wit's end,\" Ms Ingram said.\n\"They have crying children in their arms who they are unable to feed, and they know that they need to get them food, but there is just nothing that they can do to help their kids survive.\"\nThe UN has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness.\nIsrael has been critical of the UN-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates.\nIt was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC.\nWires"

      "text": "The United Nations on Friday officially declared a famine in Gaza, the first in the Middle East, warning that over 500,000 residents are now facing “catastrophic” hunger.\nThe announcement underscores a spiraling humanitarian crisis intensified by more than 22 months of relentless conflict, blocked aid and collapsed local food systems.\nU.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher, speaking from Geneva, said the famine was entirely preventable. “Food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction,” Fletcher said. “It is a famine that should haunt us all.” Israel’s government immediately rejected the declaration, dismissing the report as “based on Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests,” and asserting that “there is no famine in Gaza.”\nThe Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a coalition of U.N.-backed monitors, confirmed that Gaza City – which houses roughly 20% of the territory’s population – has reached IPC Phase 5, the technical threshold for famine.\nBy the end of September, the panel expects famine conditions to extend to Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis, putting nearly two-thirds of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents at severe risk.\nThe crisis stems from a catastrophic collapse of Gaza’s local food system.\nAccording to the IPC, 98% of cropland is damaged, inaccessible or destroyed, livestock populations have been decimated, and fishing – a vital source of protein – remains banned.\nMarkets are nearly empty, commercial imports remain limited and unaffordable, and most residents rely entirely on aid, which continues to flow erratically due to border restrictions and ongoing conflict.\nIsrael imposed a near-total blockade in March 2025, halting most humanitarian supplies for months.\nThough limited aid deliveries resumed in late May, volumes are far too low and distribution remains chaotic.\nA U.N. aid report notes that approximately 90% of food trucked into Gaza is diverted or never reaches those most in need.\n“The overall volume of nutrition supplies remains completely insufficient to prevent further deterioration,” said Rik Peeperkorn, World Health Organization representative in Palestine. “The market needs to be flooded. Dietary diversity is essential, but it is largely absent.”\nChildren are among the most vulnerable. Malnutrition is surging, with fortified milk, high-energy biscuits and therapeutic pastes in critically short supply.\nUNICEF estimates that only 2,500 of the 10,000 babies who need formula currently have access to it.\nHospitals report alarming increases in child mortality from malnutrition: Gaza’s Health Ministry recorded 133 deaths in the first 20 days of August alone, including 25 children under 18.\nAt Rantisi Hospital in Gaza City, the human toll is stark.\nThree-month-old Kholoud al-Aqra weighs just 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) – far below the World Health Organization’s average of 6 kilograms for girls her age.\nHer mother, Heba al-Aqra, is severely malnourished and struggles to produce enough milk. “I feel dizzy when I breastfeed her because there is no good food for me,” she said.\nFamilies, desperate for nourishment, resort to wild plants and minimal soups to sustain infants and children.\nJeanette Bailey, child nutrition lead at the International Rescue Committee, called the crisis “the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe we can measure,” warning that malnourished children and pregnant women are at risk of severe illness or death without immediate intervention.\nGaza’s health care system is under immense strain.\nHospitals are overwhelmed, medical supplies are scarce, and access to safe drinking water and sanitation is limited.\nThe WHO and other agencies report that infections are spreading rapidly in overcrowded shelters, and malnourished populations have compromised immune systems, exacerbating vulnerability to disease.\nThe IPC uses stringent criteria to define famine: at least 20% of households must face extreme food scarcity, 30% of children under five must be acutely malnourished, and two deaths per 10,000 people per day must result from starvation or malnutrition-related illness.\nCurrent reports indicate Gaza meets all three thresholds.\nThe humanitarian crisis is entangled in politics. Israel disputes malnutrition figures and attributes deaths to other medical conditions.\nHamas officials insist that famine conditions are “more grave than reported” and call for immediate aid access.\nBoth sides have accused each other of obstructing assistance.\nAid organizations have highlighted logistical and security challenges.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), working with Samaritan’s Purse, has distributed 150,000 supplemental nutrition packs, enough for roughly 5,000 children for a month.\nHowever, these figures fall far short of actual need, and malnourished children often cannot access therapeutic foods consistently.\nFletcher and other U.N. officials emphasize that this famine is not inevitable.\nFood exists but cannot reach the people who need it.\nWithout a dramatic increase in aid and commercial imports, experts warn the crisis will worsen, particularly for children under five and other vulnerable groups.\n“Without sustained entry of specialized nutrition supplements, this preventable crisis will become a full-blown nutrition emergency,” said Antoine Renard, country director for the World Food Programme in Palestine."

      "text": "Parts of Gaza are officially experiencing a “man-made” famine, according to a Friday report by a United Nations-backed initiative, which added that the situation is expected to worsen after months of relentless conflict.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) found that famine has been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City, now also the site of a major new Israeli offensive.\n“As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed.”\nThe IPC called for an immediate ceasefire, saying that without a truce that allows humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, “avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”\nDuring nearly two years of war in Gaza, Israel has at times restricted or cut off the entry of aid to the ravaged enclave.\nWhile some people have died of starvation and hunger, others have been killed trying to receive aid at distribution sites run by the controversial US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was brought in place to replace a UN system long criticized by Israel.\nUS Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said Saturday that the UN should declare itself “corrupt” and “incompetent” after the IPC declaration of famine.\n“The (international) media is missing the real story of ‘famine’ in Gaza. Hostages ARE starving, Hamas is getting fat, & the UN declares famine while 92% of THEIR food is stolen to be sold by Hamas,” Huckabee posted on X. “Meanwhile UN food sits rotting in sun. The UN should declare itself corrupt & incompetent.”\nThe Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli agency tasked with facilitating aid distribution in Gaza, rejected the IPC report ahead of its release, saying it “relies on partial, biased data and superficial information originating from Hamas.”\nCOGAT said that the IPC’s “one-sided approach completely disregards the extensive humanitarian efforts undertaken in Gaza,” adding that the report ignored information provided to its authors by Israel.\nIt also stated that in terms of aid the “overall trend has shifted” in Gaza, but that Hamas has continued to exploit humanitarian supplies.\nAid groups, the UN and harrowing testimony and images emerging from Gaza have, however, painted a different picture.\nUS President Donald Trump last month said there is “real starvation” in Gaza, contradicting statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said that no one is starving in the territory.\n‘No more excuses’\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres said the famine reported in Gaza is “a man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself.”\n“As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal obligations under international law – including the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population,” Guterres added. “We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity. No more excuses.”\nTom Fletcher, the UN emergency relief coordinator, urged the world to read the IPC report “from cover to cover.”\n“Read it in sorrow and anger, not as words and numbers but names and lives. Be in no doubt that this irrefutable testimony. It is a famine, the Gaza famine. The famine that we could have prevented if we were allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” Fletcher said Friday at a news briefing.\nAmnesty International called the IPC’s findings “a scathing indictment of the failure of states to press Israel into ending its genocide in the occupied Gaza Strip” and said the report confirmed what human rights and aid groups have long been warning of.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF all reiterated that “famine must be stopped at all costs” and expressed serious concern about the threat of an intensified offensive in Gaza City.\nCNN, along with other media outlets, has widely reported on hunger and starvation in Gaza.\nArab nations including Kuwait, Jordan and Saudi Arabia condemned the situation, as did the UK, and New York City’s mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.\nLast month, CNN reported the death of 4-year-old Razan Abu Zaher, who died at a hospital in central Gaza from complications brought on by malnutrition, according to a medical source. Her skeletal body was laid out on a slab of stone.\nTwo more deaths due to starvation were recorded Thursday by the Palestinian health ministry, bringing the total number of those who died of malnutrition to 271, including 112 children.\nFriday’s IPC report added that “malnutrition threatens the lives of 132,000 children under five through June 2026, including 41,000 severe cases, doubling May’s numbers.”\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC has previously determined famines in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan’s western Darfur region last year.\nThis is the first time the IPC has confirmed famine in the Middle East.\nUnder the IPC system – a five-phase scale used to measure the severity of food insecurity – a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met.\nThose conditions are: at least 20% of all households must face an extreme food shortage, 30% or more of children must be acutely malnourished or 15% of children suffering from acute malnutrition based on body measurements, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people die every day because of outright starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nIsrael accused the IPC of lowering its global standard for famine only for Gaza, an accusation which the organization said was “completely false,” pointing out that the same standard has been in use since 2019.\n‘Of course there is famine’\nPalestinians living in Gaza City, many of whom were displaced from other corners of the enclave, say it is high time the city is classified as being in famine, which they say they have endured for months.\n“This classification comes at the right time to show the world the magnitude of the tragedy and catastrophe in the Gaza Strip,” Ahed Ferwana, a Palestinian journalist and analyst residing in Gaza City, told CNN. “The strip has been suffering for months from starvation on the hands of (Israeli) aggression and closure of border crossings.”\nBisan Gazal, a displaced woman in the city, said that “of course there is famine,” adding that she and her family sometimes have one meal a day, while other days they don’t eat at all.\n“Sometimes we find nothing to eat, it’s very hard,” she told CNN on Friday. “Our children fall asleep in tears.”\nTawfeeq Abu Rajad, another displaced man living in western Gaza City, said that food prices are skyrocketing and there is little to no protein available.\nThe IPC designation of Gaza as in famine is “accurate,” he said.\n“We hope that all entities and international establishments put an end to this famine as soon as possible.”\nCNN’s Niamh Kennedy and Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, contributed reporting.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

      "text": "Famine is occurring in Gaza, the leading global tracker of food insecurity announced on Friday, pointing to “catastrophic” conditions for more than half a million Palestinians — including tens of thousands of children edging toward death via acute malnutrition — largely because of Israeli policies enabled by extensive U.S. support.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is officially applying the famine classification to Gaza for the first time since the nearly two-year Israeli campaign there began, saying famine is confirmed in the governorate, including Gaza City, the region Israeli forces are preparing to target in a new offensive. The IPC, considered the gold standard for tracking hunger, is a consortium that includes 21 United Nations agencies and major nongovernmental aid groups.\n“As this famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the 59-page report states. “The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay — even by days — will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related mortality.”\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry rejected the IPC’s findings, declaring that “there is no famine in Gaza,” and accusing the group of producing a “fabricated report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign.”\n“The entire IPC document is based on Hamas lies laundered through organizations with vested interests,” it said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n“This assessment too will be thrown into the despicable trash bin of political documents,” it continued.\nIn September, famine is expected to expand to two other governorates, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the IPC added. The group noted it was unable to secure data about north Gaza, one of the hardest-hit areas during the war. The IPC also noted that the number of children under five who could die by starvation has doubled since its last projection in May; it now anticipates that at least 132,000 will be in that category by June 2026. It described the deterioration among Palestinians as the most severe it has recorded anywhere in the world since its founding in 2004.\n“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies, and basic health, nutrition, and WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially,” the report adds.\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres renewed calls for an end to the violence unfolding in Gaza, denouncing the dire conditions faced by Palestinians there.\n“Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine,’” he said.\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said the famine detailed in the IPC report is “the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government.”\n“It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing,” Türk said in a statement.\nThe IPC finding represents a chilling milestone for the war. While warnings of mass hunger and fatal starvation in the region spread, U.S. and Israeli officials have mostly ignored extensive pleas to end policies like severe Israeli restrictions on the entry of supplies to Gaza and ongoing Israeli attacks on the strip, which have repeatedly hit humanitarian workers and made it hard for them to distribute goods. Previous research by the IPC and other experts, including U.S. government officials, had suggested famine was occurring but then was abated by tweaks in policies around aid, confirming that policymakers’ choices made the situation more desperate.\n“Israel caused the famine confirmed today in Gaza Governorate, but the United States has made it possible, supplying the arms, funding, and political cover at every step leading to this tragic point,” Scott Paul, the director of peace and security at Oxfam America, said in a statement. “Now, the Trump administration must do all in its power to reach an immediate, permanent ceasefire, ensure there is a sustained surge of aid, and the release of all hostages and illegally detained prisoners. The U.S. should suspend offensive arms sales to Israel now. There is not a second to waste while more people die from starvation every day.”\nPaul’s group is among those currently unable to get help to Palestinians, despite being prepared to do so. Oxfam says it has $2.5 million worth of aid in warehouses adjacent to Gaza that Israeli authorities refuse to allow in.\nIsrael offers several often conflicting arguments about hunger among Palestinians: that sufficient food is available; that militants, chiefly the faction Hamas, steal aid en masse (a claim which officials in Israel, the U.N. and the U.S. have rejected); and that it is supporting a functioning aid system through a program called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has also received U.S. funding.\nAmerican military contractors and Israeli troops shield the GHF, which was established in May after long-standing Israeli opposition to other humanitarian groups and attacks at GHF distribution points had killed more than 1,400 Palestinians. The GHF claims those casualty numbers are exaggerated and highlights its delivery of meals, though the packages it supplies are hard to use since they usually require water and fuel, which are in short supply.\nWith the famine announcement, “the number of people crossing that threshold into [their malnutrition] being non-survivable while still being alive is just devastating … it’s apocalyptic,” said Mark Brauner, an American doctor who volunteered in Gaza earlier this summer and described his experience to HuffPost. Brauner said he receives updates, including photographs, from Palestinians he worked alongside and cannot recognize them from seven weeks ago because of how hunger is wearing away at them.\n“They’ve taken on a completely different physicality,” he said. “They’re truly becoming skeletal, and you can see that the skin is like paper.”\nObservers note that a key reason Palestinians are particularly vulnerable to food shortages now is that most of Gaza’s population has faced repeated forced displacements and near-starvation levels before.\nUnder President Joe Biden, who largely resisted calls to pressure Israel as he surged support to the country following Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, U.S. officials found famine was occurring in April 2024, HuffPost revealed, and U.N. experts reached similar conclusions in July and November 2024. President Donald Trump has largely built on Biden’s permissive policy toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, endorsing some of his most extreme ideas, like the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.\n“The United States government has a longstanding commitment to prevent famine, but it has fueled one in Gaza,” Paul said.\nMarita Vlachou contributed reporting."

      "text": "For the first time, the world’s food crises authority announces a famine in Gaza\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — The world’s leading authority on food crises said Friday the Gaza Strip’s largest city is gripped by famine, and that it’s likely to spread across the territory without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nThe determination comes after months of warnings by aid groups that Israel’s restrictions of food and other aid into Gaza, and its military offensive, were causing starvation among Palestinian civilians, particularly children.\nIsrael rejected the report, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it an “outright lie.”\nGaza City offensive could exacerbate hunger\nThe grim milestone — the first time the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East — is sure to ramp up international pressure on Israel, which has been fighting Hamas since the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Israel says it plans to seize Gaza City and other Hamas strongholds, an escalation experts say will exacerbate the hunger crisis.\nThe IPC said hunger has been driven by fighting and the blockade of aid, and magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production in Gaza, pushing hunger to life-threatening levels across the entire territory after 22 months of war.\nMore than half a million people in Gaza, about a quarter of its population, face catastrophic levels of hunger, with many at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes, the IPC report said.\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the findings show a “human-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself” and appealed for an “immediate ceasefire.”\nIsrael disputes the report\nNetanyahu denies there’s hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation “lies” promoted by Hamas. “The IPC report is an outright lie. Israel does not have a policy of starvation,” his office posted on X.\nThe U.S. State Department also sought to cast doubt on the report. It said the humanitarian situation in Gaza “is a serious concern,” but blamed Hamas and looters for the difficulties in delivering aid.\nAfter the publication of images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of hunger-related deaths in recent weeks, Israel announced measures to let more humanitarian aid in. Yet the United Nations says what’s entering is far below what’s needed.\nThe Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to the territory, known as COGAT, called the report “false and biased.” It said significant steps had been taken to expand the amount of aid entering the strip in recent weeks.\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said more than 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, including a massive influx in recent weeks. But experts say Gaza is still reeling from the tightening of the blockade from early March until mid-May, when Israel barred the import of all food, medicine and other goods.\n“A rapidly increasing number of people, especially young children, are dying preventable deaths from starvation and disease because Israel made starvation a core part of its campaign to control the strip,” said Chris Newton, an analyst for the International Crisis Group.\nNetanyahu says more military pressure is needed to achieve Israel’s goals of freeing the hostages held by Hamas and eliminating the militant group altogether.\nHow a famine is determined\nFormal famine determinations are rare. The IPC says a famine exists in an area when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:\nAt least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children 6 months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, based on a weight-to-height measurement; or 15% of that age group suffer from acute malnutrition based on the circumference of their upper arm. And at least two people, or four children under 5, per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\nThe data analyzed between July 1 and Aug. 15 showed clear evidence that thresholds for starvation and acute malnutrition have been reached. Gathering data for mortality has been harder, but the IPC said it is reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the necessary threshold has likely been reached.\nThe IPC warned that a third of Gaza’s population could face catastrophic levels of hunger by the end of September, and that this is probably an undercount.\nAlex de Waal, author of “Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine” and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, said that had Israel allowed the IPC better access to collect data, a famine might have been determined months ago, which would have raised global awareness sooner.\n“It seems that it’s necessary for experts to shout ‘famine!’ before the world takes notice, by which time it is too late,” he said.\nIsrael has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. It says there’s currently no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza. It also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that requires Palestinians to travel long distances and pass through Israeli military lines to get aid.\nThe traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds overwhelm entering convoys.\nWitnesses, health officials and the U.N. rights office say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid from both providers, while Israel says it has only fired warning shots and that the toll is exaggerated.\nA parent in Gaza City watches his children waste away\nOn the eve of the war, Gaza City was home to some 700,000 people, about the population of Washington.\nThroughout the conflict, it has been the focus of regular Israeli bombardment and ground operations. Several neighborhoods have been almost completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year.\nDoctors and nurses in Gaza in recent weeks have seen rising numbers of visibly malnourished patients.\nKirsty Blacka, an Australian emergency nurse who worked in Gaza City’s Al-Quds hospital through June, said emaciated men with no preexisting conditions were coming in looking like teenagers because they were starving.\nShe said the lack of food has been compounded by contaminated water causing diarrhea and infections, and that diseases are harder to recover from when people are malnourished. Thousands will be too weak to evacuate the city ahead of the planned offensive, said Blacka.\nFamilies in Gaza City say they’re watching their loved ones waste away.\nYousef Sbeteh’s two teenage children were wounded by an Israeli airstrike in June and have spent the last two months in the hospital. While there, they’ve both lost weight because there hasn’t been enough food, he said, adding that he can’t afford to buy more because prices at markets have soared. Doctors say the teenagers had no preexisting conditions.\nHis 15-year-old daughter, Aya, lost nearly 20 kilograms (44 pounds), or about 30% of her body weight, according to her doctors. Her 17-year-old brother Ahmad has lost about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The lack of nutritional supplements and healthy food is slowing their recovery, doctors say.\n“Doctors say she needs protein, meat and fish,” Sbeteh said while sitting beside his frail daughter. “But I can’t provide that now.”\n___\nMednick reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

      "text": "The United Nations-backed organization responsible for monitoring global hunger is set to declare a famine in Gaza City on Friday morning, according to documents obtained by The Daily Wire.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed watchdog made up of Western governments, the United Nations, and nonprofit groups, will classify the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a famine. It will declare that the crisis is projected to spread to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.\nThis will be only the fifth time the IPC has declared a famine since its founding in 2004, and the first time it has classified two famines simultaneously, following its designation of Sudan in 2024. It is the first famine declared in the Middle East by the IPC.\nThe announcement comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu advances plans for his military to seize Gaza City by October 7, 2025—the anniversary of Hamas’s massacre of Israeli civilians. Israel’s effort aims to free the hostages, defeat Hamas, and establish a new, demilitarized Arab government that is neither the Palestinian Authority nor Hamas. Israel is preparing for mass evacuations in Gaza City and some Gazans have already left as the first phases of the offensive begin, reported the BBC.\nNETANYAHU CONFIRMS ISRAEL’S PLANS TO FULLY TAKE CONTROL OF GAZA\nThe IPC’s classification model came under fire last week after a Washington Free Beacon report accused the organization of quietly relying on a less reliable metric to determine the presence of a famine. According to the Beacon, previous IPC reports relied on detailed height and weight measurements, but its July report introduced the “mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)” metric, which was not typically used by the organization in determining a famine classification.\nMuch of the raw data the IPC relies upon are sourced from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health or other terror-linked organizations, one of the least reliable sources of accurate information, the Beacon added.\nIsrael’s Ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, took to X Thursday evening ahead of the report to accuse the IPC of promoting Hamas propaganda and publishing misleading reports.\nThe evidence continues to mount that the campaign to demonize Israel through false accusations of starving Gazans is an orchestrated effort by U.N. agencies promoting Hamas propaganda.\nNow, to further advance the malicious accusation the IPC is publishing a report “documenting”… pic.twitter.com/l3HS2LAsD7\n— Ambassador Yechiel (Michael) Leiter (@yechielleiter) August 21, 2025\n“An objective assessment of the IPC report exposes a systematic lowering of standards: neutrality of safeguards abandoned, critical stakeholders excluded, data selectively used, projections skewed toward worst cases, famine thresholds bent until they no longer matched the IPC manual itself, and transparency sidelined as key datasets and analytical reasoning remain inaccessible to outside scrutiny,” Leiter posted.\nLeiter referred to an Israeli government report making several accusations against the IPC including that it lacks neutrality, its history of off-target humanitarian predictions, and data concerns.\nAccording to the Network Contagion Research Institute’s report on the IPC, eighty percent of Gaza’s subregions “were exaggerated into higher famine phases than actually existed, making Gaza the single most overprotected region in the IPC’s recent global record.”\nDEATH PENALTY ON THE TABLE FOR KILLER OF ISRAELI EMBASSY STAFFERS\nMost notably, the Israeli report points to the IPC’s July report’s description of a 15 percent MUAC reference point for children as a “famine threshold” — even though in the organization’s manual, it uses this point as only a cutoff for its Phase 4 “emergency” classification, not its Phase 5 “famine” classification.\n“By using the ‘famine threshold’ misnomer, IPC blurred a key distinction in its own classification system, lowering the bar for famine designations and making the situation appear worse than the data justified,” the Israeli report stated.\nThe Israeli report also alleged that much of the data comes from clinic-based screenings, despite IPC guidance prohibiting such sources. Children brought to clinics are more likely to be sick and malnourished than the general population.\nEXCLUSIVE: NEW EVIDENCE CALLS INTO QUESTION VIRAL STORY OF GAZAN BOY ‘AMIR’ KILLED AT GHF AID SITE\n“MUAC was stripped of the contextualisation required by IPC’s own rules, thresholds were misrepresented, and clinic screenings were treated as if they were population surveys,” the report added. “Each of these shortcuts tilted the analysis toward more severe classifications than the evidence could sustain.”\nIPC’s May report detected a “risk of a famine” which came at a time when the Israeli-imposed blockade on Gaza was just being lifted, yet its July report showed a “rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation.” It went so far as to say that “access to food and other essential items and services have plummeted to unprecedented levels,” despite an increase in aid both through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the United Nations.\nEnd of Summer Sale – Get 40% off New DailyWire+ Annual Memberships\nAccording to the United Nations’ 2720 Mechanism for Gaza, in July, 19.8 thousand metric tonnes of humanitarian aid was delivered into Gaza, a 56% increase from June 2025 and a 140% increase from April 2024. In February 2025, 19.5K metric tonnes were delivered into Gaza, which was drastically higher than any of the 10 previous months, apart from January which saw 13.7K metric tonnes delivered.\nThe problem however, comes from the aid being looted when being driven to UN aid sites, or the UN failing to deliver it at all, leaving thousands of truckloads of food to spoil in the hot sun. The Daily Wire previously reported on exclusive footage showing a mobs attacking more than a dozen trucks carrying aid, led by vehicles marched with UN insignia."

The confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa, and fifth since 2004.\nSaturday 23 August 2025 00:34, UK\nA famine has been declared in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhoods.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - a globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition - has confirmed just four famines since it was established in 2004.\nThese were in Somalia in 2011, and in Sudan in 2017, 2020, and 2024.\nThe confirmation of famine in Gaza City is the IPC's first outside of Africa.\n\"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death,\" the report said, adding that more than a million other people face a severe level of food insecurity.\nOver the next month, conditions are also expected to worsen, with the famine projected to expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the report said.\nNearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions, while acute malnutrition is projected to continue getting worse rapidly.\nThe report said at least 132,000 children will suffer from acute malnutrition over the next year - double the organisation's estimates from May 2024.\nThe IPC said the situation could be even worse further north in Gaza, but limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael says no famine in Gaza\nVolker Turk, the UN Human Rights chief, said the famine is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government.\n\"It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of wilful killing,\" he said.\nCOGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, has rejected the findings.\nIsrael's foreign ministry said there is no famine in Gaza: \"Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets.\"\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the report was an \"outright lie\", adding that Israel \"does not have a policy of starvation\".\n\"Israel has a policy of preventing starvation. Since the beginning of the war Israel has enabled 2 million tons of aid to enter the Gaza Strip, over one ton of aid per person,\" he said in a statement.\nCeasefire pleas to stop famine\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the IPC report \"utterly horrifying and wholly preventable\", and demanded that Israel immediately allow unhindered supplies of food, medicines and fuel into Gaza.\n\"We desperately need an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required. This includes halting the military operation in Gaza City which is the epicentre of the famine,\" Mr Lammy said in a statement.\nTom Fletcher, UN under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, echoed Mr Lammy's comments as he made a desperate plea to Mr Netanyahu to declare a ceasefire in the wake of the famine announcement.\n\"My ask, my plea, my demand to Prime Minister Netanyahu and anyone who can reach him. Enough. Ceasefire. Open the crossings, north and south, all of them,\" he said.\nRead more from Sky News:\nTrump critic has home raided by the FBI\nMultiple people killed in tour bus crash\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Gaza famine was a \"man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself\".\nThe IPC had previously warned famine was imminent in parts of Gaza, but had stopped short of a formal declaration.\nThe latest report on Gaza from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there were almost 13,000 new admissions of children for acute malnutrition recorded in July.\nThe latest numbers from the Gaza health ministry are 251 dead as a result of famine and malnutrition, including 108 children.\nBut Israel has previously accused Hamas of inflating these figures, saying that most of the children who died had pre-existing health conditions."

According to officials in Jerusalem, the criteria for defining a famine were recently altered without explanation, raising concerns that the announcement is designed to exert pressure on Israel.\nLast month, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer rejected accusations that Israel is responsible for hunger in Gaza, insisting that Hamas is deliberately creating the crisis. “In Gaza today there is no famine caused by Israel,” Mencer told reporters. “There is, however, a man-made shortage engineered by Hamas. Now, too often the full story is not being told. The suffering exists because Hamas has created it. The suffering exists because Hamas has made it.”\nThis holiday season, give to:\nTruth and understanding\nThe Media Line's intrepid correspondents are in Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Pakistan providing first-person reporting.\nThey all said they cover it.\nWe see it.\nWe report with just one agenda: the truth.\nMore than 100 humanitarian aid organizations, including Oxfam, have warned that famine conditions are imminent, arguing that Israel has systematically restricted the entry of food and water. Mencer dismissed these claims as “false warnings,” reiterating that Israel facilitates aid while Hamas diverts or blocks supplies.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by both the United States and Israel, also accused Hamas of looting UN aid shipments, preventing them from reaching civilians. Israeli officials point to this pattern as evidence that Hamas manipulates humanitarian relief for its own benefit, worsening the crisis on the ground.\nJerusalem fears the anticipated IPC declaration will bolster international criticism, but maintains that the root cause of the suffering is Hamas’s exploitation of aid and deliberate creation of shortages, not Israeli policy."

      "text": "The United Nations has officially confirmed a famine in Gaza, blaming \"systematic obstruction\" of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of war, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly dismissing the findings.\nPalestinian militant group Hamas urged the United Nations to \"stop the war and lift the siege\", calling for unrestricted access for food, medicine, water and fuel.\nMr Netanyahu, whose defence minister meanwhile threatened an even more intense offensive, rejected the UN-backed report as \"an outright lie\".\nThe Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in the Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.\nIsrael has pressed ahead with plans to seize Gaza City despite an international outcry, saying that taking the territory's largest city is key to defeating Hamas.\nThe IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, covering around two-thirds of Gaza.\nWith the vast majority of the territory's population displaced at least once, the UN said nearly a million people currently live in the northern Gaza governorate.\nUN agencies and aid groups had warned for months of a looming famine in Gaza, where Israel has severely restricted aid and at times completely cut it off during its nearly two-year war with Hamas.\nCOGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, including coordinating aid to Gaza, argued that the IPC's findings rely on \"partial data and unreliable sources\".\nUN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to Palestinians in need \"because of systematic obstruction by Israel\".\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a ceasefire, saying: \"We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.\"\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said it was \"a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare\", a charge for which the International Criminal Court in November issued an arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu.\nIn a statement, Mr Netanyahu said \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation\", citing figures on aid it had allowed into Gaza.\nThe IPC report said that \"over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death\".\nIt said the deterioration between July and August was the most severe since it began analysing hunger in Gaza, driven by a sharp escalation in the war and restrictions on supplies.\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid from Gaza for two months.\nWatch: UN aid chief says Israel engaging in 'systemic obstruction' of food\nSpeaking in Geneva,Tom Fletcher said: \"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said the famine determination \"must serve as a catalyst for immediate and concrete action\".\nBritain's top diplomat David Lammy said Israel's \"refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.\"\nIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz earlier warned that \"the gates of hell will open upon\" Hamas leaders, specifically in Gaza City, \"until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war, primarily the release of all hostages and their disarmament\".\nMilitary chief Eyal Zamir said \"we are expanding operations in Gaza in the coming days\".\nLast night, Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered negotiations aimed at freeing the hostages still held in Gaza since the Hamas attack that triggered the war, 49 people, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.\nThe Israeli premier said the diplomatic push would accompany the operation to take control of Gaza City.\nMediators have been waiting for an official Israeli response to their latest ceasefire proposal, which Hamas accepted earlier this week.\nOn the ground, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 57 people today, more than half of them in Gaza City.\nUmm Mohammed Nasr, a 42-year-old mother of four from Gaza City, said that \"the bombing hasn't stopped since this morning ... but we have no idea where to go\".\nRead more:\nMiddle East stories\nHow does the IPC global hunger monitor determine famine?\nIsrael vows to destroy Gaza City if Hamas doesn't disarm, release hostages\n\"We are dying,\" she said.\nMedia restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency or the Israeli military.\nHamas's October 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.\nAccreditation: Reuters/AFP"

      "text": "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-supported entity tasked with assessing global hunger, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City for the first time.\nEstablished in 2004, the IPC has only recognized four famines, the last being in Sudan last year. Despite previous warnings about imminent famine in Gaza, the IPC hesitated to formalize a declaration due to insufficient data until now.\nThe declaration comes as Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu intensifies the genocidal war in Gaza City, which is inhabited by approximately 500,000 people.\nNetanyahu has previously denied the existence of famine in the region.\nTo meet the criteria for declaring a famine, the IPC dictates that at least 20% of households must experience extreme food scarcity, 30% of children must suffer from acute malnutrition, and a minimum of two people per 10,000 must die daily from starvation.\nThe IPC will classify the famine as occurring in the \"Gaza Governorate,\" which includes Gaza City and surrounding towns.\nAccording to the IPC briefing, the situation in Gaza is catastrophic, with more than half a million residents facing dire conditions marked by food deprivation and mortality.\nThe famine is expected to spread to other areas by the end of September, affecting approximately 1.07 million people, who are currently in a state of \"emergency\" food insecurity.\nNetanyahu faces significant international criticism for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, prompting Israel to announce measures to facilitate the entry of more aid. He asserted that \"hundreds of trucks\" have been allowed entry and refuted that Israel is implementing a \"starvation policy.\"\nIn anticipation of a full-scale military takeover of Gaza City, Israel has mobilized 60,000 reservists. Israeli forces are reported to have established positions on the city's outskirts amidst ongoing airstrikes, leading to the mass displacement of residents.\nThe IPC and its partner organizations, including Save the Children and UNICEF, predict worsening food security conditions in Gaza over the coming months. Nearly a third of Gaza's population is expected to face catastrophic living conditions, while those in emergency status could rise to 1.14 million.\nThis declaration marks a historic event as it is the first officially recognized famine in the Middle East, and only the fifth time the IPC has issued a famine declaration, with previous instances occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.\nIn the context of the ongoing war, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that 271 individuals had succumbed to starvation, 112 of whom were children.\nIsrael unleashed its brutal Gaza onslaught on October 7, 2023, after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the Zionist entity in response to the regime's decades-long campaign of death and destruction against Palestinians.\nThe genocidal war has so far killed nearly 62,122 Palestinians and injured 156,758 others, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry of Gaza.\nIsrael has sealed all border crossings, blocking the entry of aid and further worsening Gaza's already dire humanitarian crisis since March 2, when it violated its ceasefire agreement with Hamas."

It is a man-made crisis and the forced starvation of a people.\n“It has been waged with no compassion for Palestinian people while governments around the world have done little to end the siege or ensure that humanitarian aid reaches people in Gaza.\n“We are witnessing late-stage genocide unfold on the world stage, and our governments are actively participating by allowing Israeli forces to carry on rounding up displaced Palestinians, and killing them when they attempt to find food and water.\n“I implore both the UK and Scottish governments to take immediate action. That means replacing military and political support for Israel with a package of sanctions. Downing Street must immediately end all arms sales and military cooperation with an Israeli government that is inflicting some of the worst atrocities of this century on the people of Gaza.\n“Scotland can and must lead by example. There can be no more excuses. The SNP must finally back global calls for boycott, disinvestment and sanctions and finally stop public funding for companies with Palestinian blood on their hands.”"

      "text": "The IPC released a report on Friday in which it said that famine was taking place in Gaza City and surrounding towns. It applied the classification to an area home to 514,000 displaced Palestinians – nearly quarter of Gaza’s population.\nWhile the body has previously warned that famine was imminent across Gaza, it had stopped short of making a formal declaration.\nThe IPC is the globally recognised system for classifying the severity of food insecurity.\nIt is an initiative involving 21 aid organisations, as well as several United Nations agencies. It receives funding from the European Union, the United States, Germany, Britain, Canada and others.\nSince its creation in 2004, it has declared five famines. The most recent one was in Sudan last year.\nIt declares famine if three criteria are met: at least 20 percent of households face an extreme lack of food, at least 30 percent of children are suffering acute malnutrition, and two out of every 10,000 are dying each day due to “outright starvation”.\n“After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions, characterised by starvation, destitution and death,” the IPC said.\n“Another 1.07 million people (54 percent) are in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), and 396,000 people (20 percent) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).”\nIt added that famine would expand to the areas of Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, and Khan Younis to the south by the end of September based on current projections.\nThat would bring the number of people experiencing famine in Gaza to 641,000 people.\nIn that same timeframe, it projects that the number of people in the “emergency” phase four category would rise from 1.07m to 1.14m.\n“The famine declared today in Gaza Governorate by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification is the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government,” Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief stated.\n“It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of wilful killing.”\nIsrael imposed a near total blockade on the entry of food and humanitarian aid into Gaza on 2 March.\nIt only began allowing food and aid into the enclave in late May, but almost exclusively through the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nHowever, aid workers, governments and Palestinians on the ground say the amount of humanitarian relief delivered is nowhere near enough needed to feel Gaza’s population of two million.\nMeanwhile, Gaza health officials say that since the GHF took over aid delivery, more than 2,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while seeking aid supplies.\nThe UN and other major international aid groups have refused US and Israeli calls to cooperate with GHF, stating that the organisation violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.\nIn recent days, more aid trucks have been allowed by Israeli authorities to enter into Gaza, though far less than what is required to meet the urgent needs of starving Palestinians.\nAccording to the UN, the entire population under five in the Gaza Strip – more than 320,000 children – are at risk of acute malnutrition, due to a lack of safe water, breastmilk substitutes and therapeutic feeding.\nOver 270 people have died from malnutrition in Gaza since Israel’s war began in October 2023. That includes at least 112 children.\nThe IPC said that through to June 2026, at least 132,000 children under five were expected to suffer from acute malnutrition – double the estimate from May this year. That includes 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death.\n“Nearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will also require urgent nutrition response,” it added.\nThe IPC said on Friday that its analysis only covered Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, adding that it was unable to classify the governorate in northern Gaza due to restrictions of access and a lack of data.\n“As this famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report noted.\n“The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed.”\nIt added that if an immediate and sustained ceasefire is not implemented, with access to humanitarian aid and food supplies for everyone in the Gaza Strip, “avoidable deaths will increase exponentially”.\nIt marks the first time the IPC has classified famine to be taking place outside of Africa.\nThe previous classifications were Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024."

There is no level 6.\nBut it took only moments for the Israeli government to respond in terms that were just as strident. The report dismissed as wholly inaccurate, based on biased, inaccurate data and influenced not by fact, but by the whims of Hamas.\nCOGAT, the Israeli agency that oversees humanitarian efforts in Gaza, claimed the IPC had ignored its data and presented a “one-sided report”, before claiming that “hundreds of truckloads of aid are still awaiting collection by the UN and international organisations”.\nWhat is so striking is that there is no grey area between these two versions.\nIn one, Israel has obstructed the delivery of aid and allowed hunger to turn into famine; in the other, it is Hamas that has caused the crisis by stealing aid and exploiting hunger as a political tool to try to win global sympathy.\nJournalists are not allowed to enter Gaza, so we are reliant on the work of colleagues who live there.\nBut the images are striking – emaciated people holding begging bowls, people scrambling towards aid drops or clambering over trucks carrying bags of flour. And all around them, shattered buildings.\nWe heard from a man in his 70s, who used to weigh 70kg, but who has lost almost half his body weight.\n“Now, because of malnutrition, my weight has dropped to just 40,” Hassan Abu Seble said. “I suffered both a stroke and a heart attack. They had to put in a stent to help me recover, and I thank God that my organs are still functioning.”\nThe Israeli government, and many across the country, will maintain that Hamas bears the responsibility for everything that has happened to Gazans – that it was the attack on 7 October, 2023, that was the sole precipitant for the suffering, death and hunger that has followed.\nBut from around much of the rest of the world, the condemnation is deafening, accusing Israel of allowing famine to fester.\nDavid Lammy, Britain’s foreign secretary, said the Israeli government had caused a “man-made famine” by blocking the distribution of aid, and described that as a “moral outrage”.\nThe question, as so often before, is what that rhetoric leads to. And, so long as the United States doesn’t join the chorus of disapproval, does widespread global disapproval mean anything?\nThere is also a question now of Gaza’s future.\nRead more from Sky News:\nIsrael to continue with Gaza City offensive\nFamine is our ‘worst fears being realised’\nAnalysis: Netanyahu has a decision to make\nIn the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City, we found a large sign that says “Make Gaza Jewish Again”. It is a slogan, and a sentiment, that is supported by plenty.\n“Yes, of course I agree,” says one man as he walks past, carrying a large pack of drinks. It turns out that he used to live in a Jewish settlement in Gaza until it was shut by the Israeli government two decades ago, but he has never stopped believing that Gaza is rightly Israel’s property.\n“The people there now – they should leave. They could go to Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt. It is our land. And yes, I would like to go back there.”\nHe did not believe there was a famine. “They have lots of food,” he told me.\nAnother man, Avraham, was more conciliatory, but insisted there had never been a country like Israel “that is fighting a war against a country but is also sending in so much humanitarian aid for the people”.\nGaza City is now the focal point of so much. Famine is spreading from this heart just as troops prepare to encircle the city. A ceasefire could come, but so could a huge military assault. And all the while, the hunger will get worse."

      "text": "The Looming Global Food Security Crisis: Gaza as a Harbinger of Systemic Collapse\nOver 579,000 people – more than half of Gaza’s population – are now experiencing ‘catastrophic’ levels of food insecurity, according to a recent UN-backed report. This isn’t simply a regional tragedy; it’s a stark warning signal about the fragility of global food systems and the escalating risk of widespread famine in a world increasingly vulnerable to climate change, conflict, and economic instability. The situation in Gaza, while uniquely dire, is a microcosm of a much larger, rapidly unfolding crisis.\nBeyond Gaza: A Cascade of Risk Factors\nThe reports emerging from Gaza – confirming famine conditions – are being met with dispute, particularly from Israel. However, the core issue transcends political debate. The underlying problem is a confluence of factors that are simultaneously impacting food production and distribution worldwide. These include prolonged droughts in key agricultural regions like the Horn of Africa, devastating floods in South America, and the ongoing disruption of supply chains due to geopolitical tensions. The war in Ukraine, for example, continues to impact global grain markets, and escalating conflicts in other regions threaten to exacerbate these disruptions.\nThe Climate-Conflict Nexus\nClimate change isn’t merely an environmental issue; it’s a threat multiplier. Increasingly frequent and severe weather events are destroying crops, displacing populations, and fueling conflict over dwindling resources. This creates a vicious cycle: conflict disrupts agricultural production, leading to food shortages, which in turn exacerbate existing tensions and increase the risk of further conflict. Gaza, already facing immense challenges, is particularly vulnerable to this nexus, but the pattern is repeating itself across the globe.\nThe Erosion of Humanitarian Access\nEven when food is available, getting it to those who need it most is becoming increasingly difficult. Humanitarian access is routinely blocked by conflict, bureaucratic obstacles, and a lack of political will. The situation in Gaza highlights the extreme consequences of this trend, with aid organizations struggling to deliver essential supplies amidst ongoing hostilities. This isn’t limited to conflict zones; increasingly restrictive immigration policies and border controls are also hindering the movement of agricultural workers, impacting food production in many countries.\nThe Rise of ‘Climate Refugees’ and Food-Driven Migration\nAs food insecurity worsens, we can expect to see a significant increase in climate-induced migration. People will be forced to leave their homes in search of food, water, and livelihoods, putting further strain on already overburdened resources in receiving countries. This mass displacement will not only create humanitarian crises but also fuel social and political instability. The scale of this migration could dwarf previous refugee flows, creating unprecedented challenges for international cooperation.\nThe Potential for Systemic Financial Contagion\nThe economic consequences of widespread famine and food insecurity are also significant. Food price spikes can trigger social unrest, destabilize governments, and disrupt global financial markets. A major food crisis could lead to a cascade of defaults and bankruptcies, particularly in countries heavily reliant on food imports. The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that a crisis in one region could quickly spread to others.\nFood security is no longer simply a matter of agricultural output; it’s a complex issue with far-reaching implications for global stability and human well-being.\n| Region | Projected Food Insecurity (2025) |\n|---|---|\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | +25% increase in acutely food insecure population |\n| Middle East & North Africa | +18% increase in acutely food insecure population |\n| South Asia | +12% increase in acutely food insecure population |\nPreparing for a Future of Scarcity\nAddressing this looming crisis requires a multifaceted approach. Investing in climate-resilient agriculture, strengthening supply chains, and promoting sustainable food systems are all essential. However, these measures alone will not be enough. We also need to address the underlying political and economic factors that contribute to food insecurity, including conflict, inequality, and a lack of access to resources. Furthermore, a fundamental shift in global priorities is needed, with greater emphasis placed on long-term sustainability and human well-being over short-term economic gains.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Global Food Security\nWhat role does technology play in addressing food insecurity?\nTechnology, including precision agriculture, vertical farming, and gene editing, offers promising solutions for increasing food production and improving crop resilience. However, these technologies must be accessible to all, not just wealthy nations and corporations.\nHow can individuals contribute to improving food security?\nIndividuals can reduce food waste, support local farmers, advocate for sustainable food policies, and make informed choices about their diets. Reducing meat consumption, for example, can significantly lower the environmental impact of food production.\nIs a global famine inevitable?\nA global famine is not inevitable, but the risk is increasing. Proactive measures, including increased investment in food security, conflict resolution, and climate adaptation, are crucial to averting a catastrophic outcome.\nThe situation in Gaza is a wake-up call. It’s a reminder that food security is not a given, and that the consequences of inaction could be devastating. The time to act is now, before the crisis spirals out of control and the world faces a future of widespread hunger and instability. What are your predictions for the future of global food security?

      "text": "🌍 Not Hunger. Not Shortage. Famine in Gaza — Declared at Last.\nFor the first time, the global authority on famine confirms the truth Palestinians and activists have been saying all along.\n🚨 Quick Note Before You Read\nSisters and brothers, this is exactly why our work matters. While politicians and media outlets argued over semantics, children in Gaza were literally starving to death. This space is one of the few left on earth where we can say that plainly. 👉🏽 Please become a paid subscriber today.\n🟥 The Word They Refused To Say\nFor nearly a year, we have watched Gaza descend into hunger unlike anything we’ve ever seen in modern history. It’s a completely artificial, optional, man-made famine, imposed by Israel, funded by the United States, and protected by most of the world.\nParents are boiling grass and weeds. Mothers are feeding their children animal feed. Families are grinding up dried corn husks. Children’s arms are shrinking down to the width of sticks. And still, the governments of Israel, the United States, and much of Europe denied it.\nThey admitted “food shortages.” They admitted “malnutrition.” They used softer words like “emergency” and “crisis.” They admitted the images were horrific, but they would not use the one word that would force the world to face what was happening. They refused to say famine. Why? Because it’s a legal word with serious legal implications.\nNow, that denial has collapsed. The IPC Global Initiative, the most respected international body that defines and classifies food crises, has formally declared that famine is occurring in Gaza. The declaration states: “As of 15 August 2025, Famine (IPC Phase 5)—with reasonable evidence—is confirmed in Gaza Governorate. Over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death.”\nAfter 22 months of relentless war, displacement, and blockade, the catastrophe is no longer disputed. It is written down, measured, confirmed.\nGaza is in famine.\nHere is their full report for you to see for yourself (click on the image).\n❓Who is the IPC?\nThe IPC — short for the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification — is the world’s singular authority on defining and declaring famine. It is not a political group, not an activist network, but a global scientific initiative backed by the United Nations, governments, and humanitarian agencies.\nThe IPC uses a strict evidence-based framework to measure hunger, malnutrition, and mortality, classifying conditions from Phase 1 (Minimal) to Phase 5 (Famine). For an area to be declared in famine, all three catastrophic thresholds must be crossed: at least 20% of households face extreme food deprivation, at least 30% of children are acutely malnourished, and at least two out of every 10,000 people die each day from starvation or related disease. These definitions are designed to cut through politics and propaganda. When the IPC says “famine,” it means starvation, death, and collapse at the highest level of international law and humanitarian consensus.\n⚖️ What “Famine” Means\nIt’s important to understand the weight of this word. “Famine” is not a metaphor. It is not an activist slogan. It is a formal classification under international law.\nAgain, to be meet the legal definition of famine for the IPC, three thresholds must all be crossed. At least 20 percent of households must face extreme, life-threatening lack of food. At least 30 percent of children must suffer from acute malnutrition. And at least two out of every 10,000 people must be dying each day from starvation or starvation-related disease. This is not an editorial decision. It’s literally just math.\nThe IPC review makes it clear: “The convergence of widespread malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, lack of access to healthcare, deteriorating water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, and surging child diseases mirrors the established combination of factors that lead to death in Famine conditions.”\nThat is where Gaza is today. Those are the numbers. This is not “hunger.” This is starvation, destitution, and mass death.\n🩸 The Human Cost\nThe declaration paints a devastating picture. More than 641,000 people — nearly a third of Gaza’s population — are already in famine conditions. Another 1.14 million are in Emergency and nearly 400,000 more are in Crisis. This means virtually the entire population is in survival mode.\nThe IPC projects that 132,000 children under the age of five will suffer acute malnutrition through June of next year. That includes more than 41,000 severe cases, children whose bodies are wasting away to the point of imminent death. Nearly 55,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women are already malnourished and need urgent support.\nBetween May and July, acute malnutrition tripled in Gaza Governorate. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, it doubledand is projected to reach famine thresholds by late September. In other words, this isn’t just about the north. The entire Strip is collapsing.\nAnd the mortality data we do have is almost certainly an undercount. Gaza’s health system has collapsed. Many deaths are never reported or recorded. But the report makes it clear: “Mortality among the population in Gaza Governorate is assessed to have reached the famine threshold. Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis are projected to reach similarly critical levels by late September.”\nBehind these numbers are children whose bellies are bloated with hunger. Infants who cannot cry because their bodies don’t have the energy. Mothers who cannot breastfeed because they themselves have no food. Families who are starving slowly while the world debates.\n🚧 Starvation by Policy\nThe IPC makes something else clear. This is not an earthquake. It is not a flood. It is not a natural disaster. This famine is entirely man-made.\nThe food system in Gaza has been deliberately destroyed. Ninety-eight percent of cropland is gone. Livestock have been wiped out. Fishing has been banned. Bakeries and community kitchens have been closed. Flour prices have soared more than 3,000 percent since February.\nHumanitarian convoys were halted completely in March and April. When some aid finally resumed in the summer, most of it never reached the people. According to the report, “Aid deliveries have been severely disrupted—with 87 percent of UN trucks reportedly intercepted—reflecting the extreme desperation of the population.”\nWater has collapsed. Health has collapsed. Ninety-six percent of households have no reliable access to clean water. Disease is spreading everywhere. Diarrhea, fever, infections — all raging among children whose bodies are too weak to fight them off. The IPC warns that this deadly combination of starvation, disease, and collapsed healthcare is exactly what defines famine.\nThis is not a failure of logistics. This is not an accident of war. This is starvation used as a weapon.\n📣 A Historic Declaration\nThe IPC’s Famine Review Committee has now been called to examine Gaza’s case five separate times. Never before in history has the committee been called back so many times for one place. Each time, they reviewed the data, and each time they found that the crisis was worsening.\nTheir conclusion now is stark. Famine is here. It is spreading. And it is entirely man-made.\nThe committee’s statement says it bluntly: “As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading.”\nThey warn that every day of delay will lead to a surge in avoidable deaths. They call for an immediate ceasefire and unobstructed humanitarian access. Without it, they warn, “avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”\n✊🏽 What It Means for Us\nThis declaration is more than a technical assessment. It is an indictment. It proves beyond doubt that Israel, backed by the United States, has crossed another red line of international law.\nUnder the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, deliberately using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war is a war crime. That is what this is. That is what famine means.\nAnd it is a moral indictment of every politician who denied this was happening. Every senator and member of Congress who parroted Israeli talking points. Every journalist who minimized the word famine, who told us it was too early to say. They were wrong.\nActivists in Gaza who risked their lives to get images out were right. The mothers holding their starving babies were right. The people in tents begging for flour were right.\nNow the world has to decide: will it act? Or will it look away as tens of thousands of children die from hunger?\n❤️ Why This Space Matters\nSisters and brothers, I know these numbers are overwhelming. They are heavy. 132,000 children projected to be malnourished. Half a million already starving. But remember: famine is not inevitable. It is a choice. And it can be stopped.\nBut platforms like Instagram and Twitter have already tried to silence me for saying these truths. They banned my account. They deleted my posts. They don’t want this message to spread. That is why this community matters. This is one of the last places left where we can tell the truth about Gaza without fear of being erased.\nThe New York Times has twelve million subscribers. CNN has millions more. But we are building something different — a platform they cannot control. We now have just over 2,400 paid members. Our goal is to reach 2,500 and then 3,000.Every new member makes us stronger, more stable, more able to keep publishing the truth the world is trying to hide.\n👉🏽 Please become a paid subscriber today.\nBecause famine is not just a humanitarian failure. It is a political crime. And if we don’t tell that story here, no one will.\nLove and appreciate each of you.\nYour friend and brother,\nShaun King\nFYI: Please read, comment, share, and subscribe. That’s how we break through the silence.\nHere are some of my most recent articles - without a paywall.\nWorld outrage needed\nIt’s so frustrating when people have already been saying it, why couldn’t people listen then?!?"

The Israeli military body overseeing aid to Gaza argued that the IPC’s conclusions were based on partial data allegedly provided by Hamas.\nThe IPC explains that for an area to be formally declared in famine, three conditions must generally be met: at least 20 percent of the population should face extreme food shortages, one in three children should suffer from acute malnutrition, and at least two out of every 10,000 people must die each day from hunger or related diseases.\nHowever, the IPC notes that even if these specific thresholds are not fully met, it can still classify a situation as famine if households are experiencing what it defines as “starvation, destitution, and death.”\nMeanwhile, UN human rights chief Volker Türk stated that the famine in Gaza was directly caused by Israeli government actions. He further warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a potential war crime under international law.\nThe IPC’s findings come after several countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, and multiple European states, warned that Gaza’s humanitarian crisis had reached “unimaginable levels” following nearly two years of war between Israel and Hamas."

      "text": "A global hunger monitor confirmed on Friday that Gaza City and nearby areas are officially experiencing famine, warning it will likely spread—an assessment expected to intensify pressure on Israel to permit greater humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people – nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza – are experiencing famine, with the number due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City – known as Gaza governorate – which the IPC said was in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nIt was the first time the IPC had recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but said limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael dismissed the report as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\n“There is no famine in Gaza,” the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.\nExtreme Food Shortages\nFor a region to be classified as in a famine, at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nPreviously, the IPC has only registered famines in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the Gaza famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself”.\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\n“People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing … We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached “unimaginable levels”.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation and blamed Hamas for creating food shortages.\nIsrael Controls Gaza Access\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’ propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nThe U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify the North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data, and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region, as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC – an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organisations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nPast Famine Assessments Highlighted\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65% of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of U.S. public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict.\n(With inputs from Reuters)"

The IPC determination follows months of warnings by aid groups that Israel’s restrictions on food and aid, combined with ongoing military operations, were pushing civilians - particularly children - toward starvation.\nMore than 500,000 people in Gaza, about a quarter of the population, are facing “starvation, destitution and death,” the IPC said, noting “catastrophic conditions” are spreading after 22 months of war. Hunger has been driven by fighting, blockade, widespread displacement, and the collapse of food production.\nThe IPC says famine is declared when at least 20% of households face extreme food shortages, 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and mortality reaches two adults or four children per 10,000 daily. Data from July to mid-August showed Gaza had already met thresholds for starvation and malnutrition.\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres called the crisis “a man-made disaster” and demanded unrestricted aid access.\nIsrael rejected the report. Its foreign ministry said “there is no famine in Gaza,” while COGAT, the Israeli military agency overseeing aid transfers, called the IPC findings “false and biased.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed reports of starvation as “lies” promoted by Hamas, though images of emaciated children and reports of hunger-related deaths have mounted.\nIsrael says it has taken steps to expand aid deliveries and insists there is no limit on the number of trucks entering Gaza. But UN agencies say what enters remains far below needs, with convoys hampered by Israeli restrictions, looting, and desperate crowds. Witnesses and health officials say hundreds of civilians have been killed while seeking aid; Israel disputes the toll, saying only warning shots were fired.\nDoctors in Gaza report increasing numbers of malnourished patients. Australian nurse Kirsty Blacka said emaciated men arrived at Al-Quds hospital “looking like teenagers because they were starving.”"

      "text": "Food security experts, who have been warning for 22 months of dire food shortages and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, on Friday confirmed that one part of the enclave is suffering from famine and that it is threatening to spread to others within weeks.\nThe confirmation of famine came from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, known as the IPC, a group of international organizations that collects and analyzes data about food security, to ensure that consistent criteria are used to assess food supplies and the conditions affecting them in different countries.\nIn July, experts warned of looming famine across Gaza. Israel restricted aid soon after the war began almost two years ago, but the situation was made significantly worse by a total Israeli blockade on food supplies for roughly 80 days between March and May.\nOn Friday, the IPC confirmed famine in the Gaza Governorate, which includes Gaza City and the surrounding area. It projected that famine could spread to south and central Gaza by the end of September.\nThe Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, an Israeli agency responsible for managing the entry of aid into Gaza, rejected the IPC's findings.\n\"The IPC report is based on partial and unreliable sources, many of them affiliated with Hamas, and blatantly ignores the facts and the extensive humanitarian efforts led by the state of Israel and its international partners,\" said Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, the head of the agency.\nHere's what to know about the IPC's report on famine in parts of Gaza.\nHow do experts define famine?\nThe IPC classifies famine in an area when at least 1 in 5 households face an extreme lack of food, a certain percentage of children are acutely malnourished, and two adults or four children for every 10,000 are dying each day \"due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\" According to the IPC, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing \"catastrophic conditions,\" classified at famine level and characterized by \"starvation, destitution and death.\" Twice as many, or about half of Gaza's population, are facing a state of emergency, the report said.\nHow is a famine officially declared?\nThe IPC collects data from aid groups and others on the ground and analyzes it to reach its conclusions, and the Famine Review Committee, an international panel of up to seven independent food security experts, reviews the findings.\nBut even if the IPC determines that a famine is unfolding, it cannot make an official declaration on its own.\nAccording to the IPC, its analyses allow governments, international and regional organizations, and humanitarian agencies to issue declarations of famine.\nIn 2022, Somalia's president expressed reluctance to declare a famine during a severe hunger crisis brought on by a drought. And in 2021, Ethiopia blocked a classification of famine in the Tigray region through heavy lobbying, according to a top United Nations official. In 2017, South Sudan officially declared a famine in parts of the nation.\nIt is unclear exactly what authority could or would declare a famine in Gaza. Hamas has long accused Israel of starving Palestinians in Gaza. Israel denies that there is starvation in the enclave. The IPC's role is solely to analyze and classify data, not to decide who would issue a declaration.\nAid groups have long believed that an official declaration of famine can lead to more international attention, assistance and support, but some experts say there is little evidence for that claim.\nWhat does the report say is causing famine in Gaza?\nThe IPC said several factors had tipped Gaza's hunger crisis into famine: the intensifying conflict, strict Israeli restrictions on aid and frequent displacement of people. The cumulative effect \"has pushed Gaza into an unprecedented catastrophe,\" it said.\nNearly a third of Gaza's population is not eating for multiple days in a row, the U.N. World Food Program said in July, linking the extreme hunger to the blockade on food supplies Israel imposed this spring.\nIsrael has accused Hamas of looting aid. But the United Nations and some Israeli military officials have disputed the claim that U.N. aid was being systematically diverted by Hamas. Before March, food was distributed from hundreds of places across Gaza in a system facilitated by the U.N. In May, Israel partly lifted its blockade and set up a system run by American contractors and backed by the United States, saying it would ensure that aid goes to civilians.\nBut there are few locations and Palestinians must walk for miles to reach distribution spots near which Israeli soldiers stand watch. The U.N. human rights office has said hundreds of people have been killed, mostly by the Israeli military, in areas surrounding the distribution sites.\nUnder intense international pressure, Israel has allowed more aid to enter in recent weeks. Israeli officials have said roughly 300 trucks of relief supplies and commercial goods have been entering Gaza daily. And the cost of some food items in markets has fallen significantly, although they remain well above prewar prices.\nBut U.N. officials said many trucks were still being intercepted by desperate people and gunmen before reaching their destination.\nAre any other countries experiencing famine?\nIn June, the IPC said that parts of Sudan were experiencing famine and that the crisis could spread.\nAfghanistan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen were among the countries facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the 2025 Global Report on Food Crisis published by the European Union-funded Food Security Information Network, based on data from the previous year.\nThe IPC has classified famine in Somalia in 2011; in South Sudan in 2017; and in Sudan in 2024, which is ongoing.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

This is the most severe level of food insecurity, defined by widespread hunger, malnutrition, and the likelihood of mass casualties if immediate relief is not provided.\nUN officials said that over 500,000 Palestinians are now trapped in situations where food is almost non-existent. Many families are surviving on minimal supplies, relying on unsafe water and consuming leaves or animal feed to endure the crisis.\nA UN humanitarian coordinator described the situation as “a man-made disaster,” emphasizing that the collapse of essential services, combined with the blockade and ongoing military operations, has cut off ordinary Gazans from food and medical aid.\nRead more: China-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue: Wang Yi Meets COAS Asim Munir in Islamabad\nFamine declared by IPC in #Gaza Governorate is a direct result of actions by #Israel‘s Government that has unlawfully restricted entry & distribution of humanitarian aid.\nIt is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to a… pic.twitter.com/knqnRpe2yH\n— UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) August 22, 2025\nIsrael Rejects UN Famine Classification\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry strongly rejected the UN findings, calling them baseless and politically motivated. A ministry spokesperson claimed there is “no famine in Gaza,” dismissing the IPC report as propaganda influenced by Hamas.\nThe Israeli government argued that aid continues to enter Gaza and accused international organizations of failing to hold Hamas responsible for controlling supplies. Officials said they would continue their military operations in Gaza City despite growing global criticism of the humanitarian toll.\nThis rejection adds to the deepening dispute between Israel and international bodies over the handling of the crisis, with the UN maintaining that restrictions on aid deliveries and destruction of infrastructure have fueled famine-like conditions.\nRising Death Toll in Gaza\nWhile food insecurity worsens, the violence on the ground continues. Palestinian hospital sources told Al Jazeera that 47 people were killed in Gaza since dawn on Friday due to Israeli strikes.\nThe majority of these deaths, at least 31, occurred in Gaza City, where Israeli forces have intensified operations in an attempt to seize control of the largest urban centre in the enclave. Witnesses reported heavy bombardments and street battles that forced families to flee their homes.\nMedical staff said five of the victims were civilians who had gathered in hopes of receiving aid. This highlights the deadly intersection of hunger and violence, as desperate Gazans risk their lives in search of food and relief.\nHumanitarian Catastrophe\nThe declaration of famine underscores the urgent need for international intervention. Aid groups warn that without immediate, large-scale humanitarian assistance, the death toll from starvation could quickly surpass those caused by military action.\nChildren are bearing the heaviest burden. Malnutrition rates among Gaza’s youngest have skyrocketed, with reports of infants dying from hunger-related complications. Health workers say hospitals, already overwhelmed by war casualties, are unable to treat the surge in hunger-related illnesses due to shortages of medicine, fuel, and electricity.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) has called for unrestricted access to Gaza, stressing that trucks carrying food supplies are often delayed or denied entry. Aid convoys that do reach the enclave face dangerous conditions, with several recent incidents of vehicles being struck during military operations.\nCalls for Ceasefire and Aid\nThe UN and humanitarian organizations continue to push for an immediate ceasefire to allow safe passage for aid. Officials argue that without halting the conflict, efforts to tackle famine will remain ineffective.\nDiplomatic efforts are intensifying, but divisions within the international community persist. While some countries have backed UN appeals for urgent action, others continue to support Israel’s right to conduct military operations, complicating consensus on how to respond to the worsening crisis.\nA Growing Global Concern\nThe UN declaration of famine in Gaza is not only a humanitarian alarm but also a geopolitical challenge. The crisis has sparked widespread protests in several countries, with activists demanding an end to the blockade and urging governments to pressure Israel into allowing full-scale humanitarian relief.\nAs the situation deteriorates, aid workers warn that Gaza risks becoming a “graveyard for children” unless immediate action is taken. The combination of famine and ongoing bombardments has created what the UN describes as one of the most severe humanitarian crises of the century.\nFollow us on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook,, X and TikTok for latest updates"

World leaders must ensure the urgent and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Palestine, and Indian citizens should actively contribute by raising awareness, boycotting Israel-linked products, and supporting the Palestinian cause through every possible means.\nThe world cannot remain silent while Gaza is subjected to starvation and mass killings. It is our moral duty to respond through protest, boycott, and prayer,” said Faraz Ahmed.\nThe protest concluded with an appeal to continue peaceful advocacy and to remember Palestinians in prayers.

      "text": "Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine, and it will likely spread, a global hunger monitor determined on Friday, an assessment that will escalate pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the Palestinian enclave.\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system said 514,000 people – nearly a quarter of Palestinians in Gaza – are experiencing famine, with the number due to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.\nSome 280,000 of those people are in a northern region covering Gaza City – known as Gaza governorate – which the IPC said was in famine following nearly two years of war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.\nIt was the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.\nIt added that the situation further north could be even worse than in Gaza City, but said limited data prevented any precise classification.\nIsrael dismissed the report as false and biased, saying the IPC had based its survey on partial data largely provided by Hamas, which did not take into account a recent influx of food.\n“There is no famine in Gaza,” the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.\nFor a region to be classified as in famine at least 20% of people must be suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or malnutrition and disease.\nPreviously, the IPC has only registered famines in Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.\nEven if a region has not yet been classified as in famine because those thresholds have not been met, the IPC can determine that households there are suffering famine conditions, which it describes as starvation, destitution and death.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the Gaza famine was a “man-made disaster, a moral indictment, and a failure of humanity itself”.\nHe called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages still held by Hamas and unfettered humanitarian access.\n“People are starving. Children are dying. And those with the duty to act are failing … We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\nU.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said that famine in Gaza was the direct result of Israeli government actions, and warned that deaths from starvation could amount to a war crime.\nThe IPC analysis comes after Britain, Canada, Australia and many European states said the humanitarian crisis had reached “unimaginable levels”.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last month said many people there were starving, putting him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said there was no starvation and blamed Hamas for creating food shortages.\nIsrael controls all access to Gaza. COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows, said the IPC report ignored Israeli data on aid deliveries and was part of an international campaign aimed at denigrating Israel.\n“The IPC report is not only biased but also serves Hamas’ propaganda campaign,” the agency said.\nThe U.N. has long complained of obstacles to getting aid into Gaza and distributing it throughout the war zone, blaming impediments on Israel and lawlessness. Israel has been critical of the U.N.-led operation and accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the militants deny.\nThe IPC said the analysis released on Friday only covered people living in Gaza, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. It was unable to classify North Gaza governorate due to access restrictions and a lack of data and it excluded any remaining population in the southern Rafah region as it is largely uninhabited.\nIt is the fifth time in the past 14 years that a famine has been determined by the IPC – an initiative involving 21 aid groups, United Nations agencies and regional organizations that is funded by the European Union, Germany, Britain and Canada.\nThe IPC has previously assessed that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024. The IPC says it does not declare famine, but instead provides analysis for governments and others to do so.\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week found that 65% of Americans believe the U.S. should help those starving in Gaza.\nIsrael has long counted on the U.S., its most powerful ally, for military aid and diplomatic support. An erosion of U.S. public support would be a worrisome sign for Israel as it faces not only Hamas militants in Gaza but unresolved conflict with Iran, its regional arch-foe.\nThe war in Gaza was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities.\nThe United States, Qatar and Egypt have been trying to broker an end to the conflict.

The time for action is not tomorrow – it is now.”\nSilence the guns, release the hostages\nUN agencies operating in Gaza joined the UN chief in calling for an immediate ceasefire to finally allow unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response and the immediate release of all hostages taken by Hamas and other militants during the 7 October 2023 terror attacks.\nAgencies also expressed grave concern over the threat of the intensified military offensive on Gaza City and any further escalation in the conflict, as it would have further devastating consequences for civilians where famine conditions already exist.\n“Many people – especially sick and malnourished children, older people and people with disabilities – may be unable to evacuate,” they said in a joint statement.\nFamine set to expand\nBy the end of September, more than 640,000 people will face 'catastrophic' levels of food insecurity – classified as IPC Phase 5 – across the Gaza Strip.\nAn additional 1.14 million people in the enclave will be in phase 4 with a further 396,000 people facing phase 3 'crisis' conditions.\nConditions in North Gaza are estimated to be as severe – or worse – than in Gaza City. However, limited data prevented an IPC classification, highlighting the urgent need for access.\nClassifying famine means that the most extreme category is triggered when three critical thresholds – extreme food deprivation, acute malnutrition and starvation-related deaths – have been breached. The latest analysis now affirms on the basis of reasonable evidence that these criteria have been met, UN agencies said.\nBriefing journalists on Friday at UN headquarters in Geneva, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said it was a famine that could have been prevented “if we had been allowed.”\nFamine in a fertile land\n“Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel. It is a famine within a few hundred metres of food, in a fertile land.\nIt is a famine that we repeatedly warned of – but that the international media has not been allowed in to cover, to bear witness,” he added.\n“It is a famine in 2025. A 21st century famine watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history. It is a famine openly promoted by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war.”\nOn a wider scale, Mr. Fletcher said it was “the world’s famine. It is a famine that asks ‘but what did you do?’ A famine that will and must haunt us all.”\nMalnutrition among children in Gaza is accelerating “at a catastrophic pace”, said UN agencies, who note that in July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – the highest monthly figure ever recorded and a six-fold increase since the start of the year.\nPossible war crime\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said the famine was the “direct result” of Israeli Government policies.\n“It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing,” he said.\n“Israeli authorities must take immediate steps to end the famine in the Gaza Governorate and prevent further loss of life across the Gaza strip. They must ensure immediate entry of humanitarian assistance in sufficient amounts, and full access to UN and other humanitarian organizations.”\nFirst Middle East famine\nSince the last IPC Analysis in May, the number of children expected to be at severe risk of death from malnutrition by the end of June 2026 has tripled from 14,100 to 43,400.\nThe new assessment reports the most severe deterioration since the IPC began analysing acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition in Gaza Strip, and it marks the first time a famine has been officially confirmed in the Middle East region.\nSince July, food and aid supplies entering Gaza increased slightly but remained vastly insufficient, inconsistent and inaccessible compared to the need.\nMeanwhile, approximately 98 percent of cropland in the territory is damaged or inaccessible – decimating the agriculture sector and local food production – and nine of ten people have been serially displaced from homes."

      "text": "The world’s leading authority on food insecurity has confirmed a famine in Gaza.\nIn a report published Friday, the United Nations-backed group of experts finds that over half a million people parts of north Gaza are at risk of dying from starvation, and hundreds of thousands more people face catastrophic shortages as the famine spreads to other areas.\n“As this Famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed. The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or IPC report says.\nThe images of skeletal children in Gaza have already caused widespread protests around the world against the Israeli offensive there, and prompted some of Israel’s most important Western allies to say they will recognize a Palestinian state. The IPC report brings the facts behind those photographs of starvation into stark relief.\nIt says famine, the most extreme classification of hunger, is occurring in Gaza Governorate and projected to expand to Deir al- Balah and Khan Younis governorates by the end of September.\nDescribing the situation as a “race against time,” the report says at least 132,000 children under the age of five could die from acute malnutrition in the coming months.\nThis estimate has doubled since an IPC report in May, showing just how drastically the conditions have worsened in Gaza in recent weeks.\nNearly 55,500 malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women will require an urgent nutrition response.\nThe Ministry of Health in Gaza said Thursday 271 people have so far died in the famine, including 112 children.\nThis is the first time famine has been confirmed in the Middle East. And it’s happened in a 25-mile-long strip of land, where trucks piled with thousands of tons of food are parked at border crossings.\nThe Gazans now dying of starvation are never more than a few miles from warehouses filled with food aid that they have no way to reach.\n“This is the direct result of months of deliberate restrictions on aid, the destruction of Gaza’s food, health, and water systems, and relentless bombardment,” Tjada D’Oyen McKenna, the CEO of Mercy Corps said in response to the statement. “This is a man-made catastrophe, entirely preventable and entirely unconscionable.”\nIsrael was quick to respond to the report. Israel’s foreign ministry accused the IPC of publishing “a tailor-made report to fit Hamas’s fake campaign”. They claim “there is no famine in Gaza.” COGAT – Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories – the Israeli military body overseeing aid, said the report is based “on partial and unreliable sources.” Israel has repeatedly said its restrictions on aid are to pressure Hamas and prevent its fighters from benefiting from it.\nBut the result has been a breakdown in the aid system for Gaza’s population living under Israeli blockade, even before this war.\nEarlier this month, more than a hundred international organizations, including Caritas Internationalis and Doctors Without Borders, accused Israel of “weaponizing” aid to help achieve its aims in Gaza. The statement from Aug. 13 said, “despite claims by Israeli authorities that there is no limit on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, most major international NGOs have been unable to deliver a single truck of lifesaving supplies since 2 March.”\nThey said their operations are hampered by new, more restrictive Israeli regulations for international aid groups, which they say have resulted in Israeli authorities denying dozens of permissions for groups to bring their aid into Gaza. “This obstruction has left millions of dollars’ worth of food, medicine, water, and shelter items stranded in warehouses across Jordan and Egypt, while Palestinians are being starved,” the statement said.\nOn July 29, an IPC alert warned that the “worst-case scenario of famine” was playing out in the Gaza Strip. It underscored the devastating living situation for Gaza’s some two million citizens, almost two years since the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prompted a full-scale Israeli military invasion of Gaza.\nAfter Israel tightened restrictions on supplies entering Gaza in mid-March, food dried up. In the weeks that followed, adults prioritized feeding their children over themselves as a coping strategy, which, according to the IPC alert, initially mitigated a rise in acute child malnutrition.\nHowever, by April, supplies had become so scarce that parents could no longer protect their children this way. The IPC alert said that between April and mid-July, over 20,000 children had to be treated for acute malnutrition.\nWhat little sustenance could be found in markets skyrocketed in price. In June, wheat flour prices increased between 1,400% and 5,600% compared to late February. By July, the IPC alert stated nearly nine out of ten households had to resort to taking “significant safety risks” to find food and scavenge from garbage.\nThe U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres posted his response to the report on social media. “Just when it seems there are no words left to describe the living hell in Gaza, a new one has been added: ‘famine’,” the U.N. chief said. “This is not a mystery — it is a man-made disaster, a moral indictment and a failure of humanity itself.”\nHundreds of civilians have been reported shot dead as they cross dangerous, militarized zones to receive supplies from the aid distribution sites of the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The foundation disputes that the killings occur near its centers and says it has distributed 132 million meals.\nBut aid experts say that much of what the group gives out is not ready-to-eat and requires water and fuel for cooking — resources that are hard to come by in Gaza, where Israeli bombardment has devastated critical infrastructure.\nMoreover, experts say the distribution sites are located primarily in militarized zones along the Khan Younis–Rafah border, where less than a quarter of Gaza’s population lives.\nFinding food and resources for cooking has been made all the more difficult by the frequent and often repeated forced displacements of families across the Gaza Strip. The IPC report said some 800,000 people have had to leave their homes in waves of displacement that have forced people to abandon any remaining resources, further disrupted access to essential health services and compounded humanitarian needs.\nThe confirmation of famine comes as Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for Israeli soldiers and 60,000 reservists to move into Gaza City.\nThe U.N. says that already nearly 90% of Gaza is under military control or off-limits to Palestinians. Gaza City is home to tens of thousands of Gazans displaced from other parts of the strip and has several of the territory’s last partially functioning hospitals. The Israeli military has started calling doctors and international organizations in the city, telling them to leave.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that Israel will now resume negotiations for the release of all hostages held in Gaza and an end to the nearly two-year-old war, but on terms acceptable to Israel. It comes in response to a temporary ceasefire proposal put forward by Egypt and Qatar that Hamas accepted on Monday.\nIsrael will dispatch negotiators to talks once a location is set, an Israeli official said. Netanyahu, however, also said he remained set on approving plans for capturing Gaza City.\nThe talks could offer a moment’s hope to Palestinians desperate for a ceasefire that the experts behind the IPC report say is so desperately needed as a first step to address the famine in Gaza.\nBut for now, the situation in the Strip remains desperate. The United Nations’ World Food Programme said in a recent report that “public order has broken down” and that “after 22 months of fighting, the social fabric of Gaza is collapsing as the fear of starvation intensifies.”\nAlmost all the trucks carrying WFP food aid inside Gaza have been stopped before reaching their destination by civilians desperate to find the sustenance they need for themselves and their families to survive."

      "text": "Gaza famine deepens while the world watches in silence\nGaza is being pushed into famine by Israel’s deliberate blockade of food and humanitarian aid, leaving thousands of Palestinian children on the edge of starvation.\nInternational aid agencies and UN officials warn that Gaza’s hunger crisis has reached catastrophic levels, describing it as one of the worst humanitarian disasters of our time.\nFor months, Israel has restricted the entry of vital food supplies, including fortified milk and therapeutic nutrition needed to save starving children. Although Tel Aviv claims it has loosened the blockade, the limited trickle of aid is nowhere near enough to feed Gaza’s population of over two million, who have been under siege since October 2023.\nAccording to Gaza’s Health Ministry, deaths from malnutrition are rising sharply. In just the first 20 days of August, 133 Palestinians died from hunger, including 25 children. These figures were verified by the World Health Organization, yet Israel continues to deny that famine exists in Gaza, dismissing reports of mass starvation as “medical complications.”\nThe United Nations, however, has accused Israel of weaponising food against civilians — a war crime under international law. Rights groups have also documented Israeli forces shooting Palestinians as they tried to collect aid.\nInside Gaza’s shattered hospitals, doctors describe heartbreaking scenes. Infants arrive emaciated, too weak to cry. Mothers, themselves starving, cannot produce milk to feed their babies. At Rantisi Hospital in Gaza City, a doctor displayed a skeletal infant whose life depends on a therapeutic formula that is almost impossible to obtain.\nSome mothers have been forced to feed their children with herbs and wild plants. “There was no milk,” said Aisha Wahdan, a young mother. “I tried chamomile and thyme, anything I could find. My baby was dying.”\nThree-month-old Kholoud al-Aqra weighs only two kilograms — barely a third of a healthy child’s weight. Her mother survives on a single bowl of soup some days and says she nearly faints while breastfeeding. Aid workers warn that without immediate therapeutic foods, thousands of babies like Kholoud will die in the coming weeks.\nAgriculture and fishing, once Gaza’s main food sources, have been destroyed by Israeli bombardments, leaving Palestinians almost entirely dependent on imports. But Israel continues to strangle those imports, allowing only limited amounts of aid while blaming the UN and local authorities for distribution problems.\nThe reality is undeniable: hunger is being used as a weapon. Aid agencies report that of the 290,000 children under five who urgently need supplements, only 3% received them last month. UNICEF says it has almost no supplies left, while the World Food Programme has warned of a “preventable mass death” if aid is not allowed to flow freely.\nDespite the suffering, Gaza’s people remain steadfast. “Hamas is keen more than anyone else for aid to reach our people,” said Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of Gaza’s media office, rejecting Israel’s propaganda that aid is being “stolen.”\nThe world has already witnessed the images: starving children, desperate parents, and long lines at destroyed bakeries. What is happening in Gaza is not a natural famine — it is a man-made catastrophe imposed by Israel’s blockade and war.\nFor Libya, and for the Arab world, the message is clear: silence in the face of starvation is complicity. The children of Gaza are not numbers in a report — they are the sons and daughters of Palestine, and they are being starved before the eyes of the world.\nHow to submit an Op-Ed: Libyan Express accepts opinion articles on a wide range of topics.

The IPC projected that famine would expand to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis within weeks.\n\"The international community has an urgent legal and moral duty to stop Israel's deliberate starvation of Palestinians, which has now officially created a famine in Gaza,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of DAWN. \"While the world dithers, Israel is making plans to slaughter or displace those Palestinians still managing to stay alive.\"\nAccording to the IPC, a Phase 5 famine classification exists \"when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 dying each day due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease.\"\nIn July 2025, DAWN urged the UN Secretary General to secure an official declaration of famine in Gaza by U.N. agencies in light of the escalating death of Palestinians due to hunger caused by Israel's deliberate starvation policy.\n\"Famine in Gaza is not inevitable — it is the result of deliberate obstruction of life-saving aid,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at DAWN. \"States must force Israel to allow immediate, large-scale, and unhindered humanitarian assistance into Gaza now, and restore commercial flows, markets, essential services, and local food production at scale to stop the mass starvation and death unfolding before our eyes.\"\nIn 2024, the International Criminal Court charged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant with the war crime of using starvation as a weapon of war, among other violations of the Rome Statute, and issued arrest warrants against them. The prosecutor found that Netanyahu and other Israeli officials intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of essentials for survival, such as food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity, between October 8, 2023, and May 20, 2024.\n\"It has been nearly two years since the Israeli defense minister openly announced Israel's intention to starve the people of Gaza,\" said Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, Israel-Palestine director at DAWN. \"The international community has stood by and passively watched as Israel starves an entire population in slow motion.\""

This is a moral outrage.\nThe IPC report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children. The Government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further.
