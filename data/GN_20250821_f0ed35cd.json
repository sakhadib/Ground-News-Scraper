      "A federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration and stayed a lower court's order for 60,000 migrants from Central America and Nepal.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay pending an appeal regarding the protections.",
      "Immigrant rights advocates allege that the Trump administration acted unlawfully in ending the protections for migrants from Central America and Nepal.",

      "On August 20, 2025, a federal appellate court in San Francisco issued a stay on a lower court ruling that had maintained Temporary Protected Status for around 60,000 migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal.",
      "This ruling came amid the Trump administration's broader effort to end TPS protections and aggressively pursue deportations despite criticisms and legal challenges alleging unlawful motives.",
      "TPS grants migrants work and travel rights due to unsafe conditions in their home countries, but Secretary Kristi Noem ended protections for 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans, citing recovery since Hurricane Mitch in 1998."

    "right": [
      "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration can end Temporary Protected Status for over 60,000 migrants from Nepal, Nicaragua, and Honduras, lifting a lower court's hold on the termination.",
      "The ruling affects approximately 7,200 Nepali migrants, with changes set for August 5 and September 8 for Nicaraguan and Honduran migrants respectively.",
      "The National TPS Alliance claims the TPS termination was influenced by racial bias and notes that many affected migrants have lived in the U.S. for over two decades."
