      "On Aug. 14, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent cease-and-desist letters to Her Safe Harbor, Plan C and an Aid Access affiliate demanding they stop mailing abortion-inducing drugs into Texas.",
      "Paxton invoked federal and state statutes, citing the 1873 Comstock Act, Texas abortion bans, and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, building on Texas's recent legislative push this month.",
      "The letters allege shipments involved mifepristone and misoprostol, estimating one pill business mailed over 19,000 pills annually while Her Safe Harbor facilitates 162 abortions weekly.",
      "Paxton warned of $100,000 civil penalties per violation and said investigations by the Texas attorney general's office could follow, building on a December 2024 lawsuit and a Texas judge's $100,000 judgment.",
      "The move sets up potential cross-border legal battles as named organizations haven't publicly responded, though Her Safe Harbor said the letter won't stop shipments and reported surging orders."
