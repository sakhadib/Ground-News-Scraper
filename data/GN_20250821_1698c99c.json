      "Israel has granted final approval for a settlement project in the occupied West Bank, which critics say will effectively divide the territory in two and threaten the future of a Palestinian state.",
      "The Planning and Building Committee approved the project after rejecting last petitions against it, and it includes around 3,500 apartments to expand the settlement of Maale Adumim.",
      "The settlement development has been under consideration for over two decades but was previously frozen due to U.S. pressure during earlier administrations.",
      "The international community views Israeli settlement construction as illegal and a barrier to peace, despite the recent approval being characterized by some as a response to western nations recognizing a Palestinian state."

      "On Wednesday, Israeli authorities granted final approval for a large-scale settlement plan to build approximately 3,500 homes in the E1 area east of Jerusalem, located in the occupied West Bank.",
      "The plan follows long-standing Israeli ambitions to develop E1, a sensitive tract that critics say would divide the West Bank and isolate East Jerusalem.",
      "Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, known for his settler advocacy and cabinet role, characterized the approval of new settlements as a deliberate strategy to undermine efforts by Western nations to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Since October 2023, violence in the West Bank has resulted in the deaths of at least 971 Palestinians, according to health ministry data, with casualties including militants; during the same timeframe, 36 Israelis, among them security personnel, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians or Israeli military actions.",
      "The Palestinian Authority and international officials warn that the project threatens the two-state solution by fragmenting Palestinian territories and undermining future state viability."
    ],
    "right": [
      "Israel has approved the construction of 3,401 settler units in Maale Adumim, which worsens Palestinian territorial connectivity.",
      "David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary of Britain, condemned the Israeli settlement plan as a \"flagrant breach of international law\" and stated it would jeopardize the two-state solution.",
      "International bodies, including the United Nations and European Union, have declared the settlement expansion illegal and detrimental to the peace process, hindering the viability of a Palestinian state.",
      "The Palestinian Authority warned that the settlement decision creates disconnected \"cantons\" and further entrenches the occupation."
