      "USCIS now requires officers to evaluate applicants' community involvement, employment history, and positive contributions beyond mere absence of criminal convictions.",
      "USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser emphasized that government assistance should not be extended to individuals who hold hostile views toward the United States or endorse anti-American beliefs, highlighting the agency’s firm approach.",
      "Critics warn the subjective nature of the screening may lead to arbitrary denials and constitutional disputes, especially concerning free speech for noncitizens."

      "The Trump administration is expanding the definition of 'good moral character' for US citizenship applications, as outlined by USCIS in a recent memo.",
      "USCIS will assess applicants based on their community involvement and contributions, not just the absence of misconduct, according to the agency's guidelines.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, USCIS chief spokesperson, stated that citizenship should not be granted to those who promote anti-American ideologies.",
      "Critics argue that the changes to citizenship criteria may lead to arbitrary enforcement and increased denial of citizenship, as expressed by Doug Rand and Gabriel J. Chin."
