      "NASA announced the discovery of a new tiny moon orbiting Uranus, which is approximately six miles wide.",
      "This moon was spotted by the Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared camera during observations in February.",
      "The discovery increases the total number of known moons of Uranus to 29, named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.",
      "Scientists believe the moon evaded detection due to its faintness and small size, even eluding Voyager 2 during its flyby about 40 years ago."

      "On Tuesday, NASA announced the James Webb Space Telescope detected a previously unseen moon around Uranus, designated S/2025 U1, raising its known moon count to 29.",
      "Because of its tiny size—about six miles—and its position inside Uranus' dark inner rings, which include 13 rings, S/2025 U1 remained undetected until Webb's observations.",
      "Using NIRCam, Webb detected glints of sunlight in a series of 10 40-minute long-exposure images taken during February observations, revealing the 14th small inner moon about 35,000 miles from Uranus' center.",
      "An official name is now awaiting International Astronomical Union approval and will likely follow the Shakespeare and Alexander Pope naming tradition, while scientists say the discovery highlights the James Webb Space Telescope's reach through its General Observer program.",
      "Astronomers say the discovery hints at more hidden objects around Uranus and builds on Voyager 2's Jan. 24, 1986 flyby, with James Webb Space Telescope extending that exploration nearly four decades later."

      "NASA’s Webb Space Telescope has discovered a new tiny moon orbiting Uranus, which measures just six miles wide.",
      "This new moon increases Uranus's total moon count to 29.",
      "The new moon is smaller and fainter than the previously known inner moons.",
      "Unlike previous missions, this discovery highlights the potential for more hidden complexities."
