      "The M23 armed group, backed by the Rwandan government, attacked villages in July, committing dozens of summary executions of primarily Hutu civilians, reported Clémentine de Montjoye from Human Rights Watch.",
      "Human Rights Watch has identified 141 people who were killed or are missing, feared dead, due to these attacks.",
      "The killings seem to be part of a military campaign against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Hutu armed group linked to the 1994 genocide.",
      "De Montjoye stated that the M23’s actions highlight the disparity between international rhetoric and the dire conditions for civilians in eastern Congo."

      "On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch reported that Rwanda-backed M23 rebels killed at least 140 people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo near Virunga National Park in July.",
      "Weeks after a June 27 U.S.-brokered deal, the peace process faltered as M23 walked away from talks last week, while HRW said their violence targets the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda.",
      "Survivors told HRW that between July 10 and 30, bodies were thrown into the Rutshuru River, forced burials blocked funerals, and 47 victims were identified.",
      "HRW urged the U.N. Security Council, European Union and governments to expand sanctions, press for arrests and allow forensic access, warning the killings could escalate tensions in Congo's mineral-rich east amid around 7 million displaced.",
      "On July 19, DRC and M23 signed a declaration of peace after nearly four years of fighting, but the U.N. office reported at least 319 killings in Rutshuru territory, which Kigali denies, calling accusations \"gratuitous\" and \"sensational allegations."

      "A woman described witnessing M23 kill her husband during the attacks.",
      "Human Rights Watch called for expanded sanctions and urged access for U.N. experts into M23-controlled areas."
