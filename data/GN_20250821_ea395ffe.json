      "The Trump administration announced new sanctions on four International Criminal Court officials for pursuing investigations into U.S. and Israeli officials for alleged war crimes.",
      "The sanctions target two judges and two prosecutors who engaged in prosecuting nationals without consent, according to the U.S. State Department.",
      "The International Criminal Court denounced the sanctions, calling them 'a flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial institution.'",
      "United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric affirmed that the ICC has the full support of the world body to carry out its work."

      "On August 20, 2025, the United States implemented new sanctions against four officials associated with the International Criminal Court, including judges and prosecutors from Canada and France.",
      "The sanctions follow U.S. objections to ICC investigations into alleged war crimes by U.S. and Israeli nationals without the consent of either country, escalating earlier Trump administration measures.",
      "The targeted officials include French judge Nicolas Guillou, who presided over a pre-trial panel issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, Canadian judge Kimberly Prost, and two deputy prosecutors from Fiji and Senegal.",
      "Secretary of State Rubio characterized the Court as a threat to national security, accusing it of being used to pursue legal actions against the United States and its key ally Israel, while Netanyahu praised the sanctions as a firm response to what he called a campaign of false accusations targeting Israel.",
      "The U.S. barred these ICC officials from entering the country and blocked their assets, intensifying its pressure campaign to impede investigations especially related to Israel and U.S. personnel in Afghanistan."
    ],
    "right": [
      "The International Criminal Court strongly rejected new U.S. sanctions against four officials, calling them an assault on judicial independence and the rules-based international order.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticized the ICC, stating it is a national security threat for targeting U.S. and Israeli officials.",
      "The sanctions freeze the assets of the designated judges and prosecutors involved in investigations against Israeli leaders.",
      "France expressed support for the ICC, condemning the U.S. sanctions and urging Washington to withdraw its penalties."
