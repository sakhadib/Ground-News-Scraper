      "Reserve soldiers were not expected to report until September, allowing Arab mediators to press truce talks as Hamas accepted a 60-day ceasefire proposal despite pressure from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and far-right coalition members to reject truces and pursue annexation plans."

      "Israel has started initial operations to take control of Gaza City, according to Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin.",
